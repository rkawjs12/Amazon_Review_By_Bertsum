4,"Bare Bones...Zero Frills...the Price is Right
  
",2.May.18,Yes,"One HDMI port. One f-type antenna nipple. That's it.No complaints. For the bucks, it doubles as a TV and monitor for computer and streaming.Sound is cheesy but bareable.Picture is good enuf.I bought two. Happy with both.",0
5,"A Happy Camper
  
",23.May.18,Yes,"I bought this to replace a small TV in the bedroom of our RV. It fits perfectly and works beautifully. I can now take my Direct TV receiver from home, put in the RV and enjoy wherever we may be. My wife is a very happy camper.",1
3,"Lacks connectability.
  
",18.Jun.18,Yes,Only complaint is the lack of connectability options to other devices such as my audio system. Also manual is very basic and offers very little useful user information.,1
5,"Nice tv for a home office.
  
",17.Aug.18,Yes,"I have this tv in my home office. I did not want nor need a smart tv. This one is perfect for my need. The volume is kept low so I can_ say if it has a great output.  The picture is better then the Samsung tv that it replaced. I have only had it for a few weeks, but I am happy with it.",1
5,"NICE KITCHEN SIZE
  
",4.Sep.18,Yes,Overall extremely satisfied with the product except for the sound which could be a bit louder.  The package came completely intact and well packed.  Instructions by LG could be clearer.,0
5,"Great little TV!
  
",7.Sep.18,Yes,"Great picture for such a small size--perfect for my office--just the right size to catch the news, may have to get one for the kitchen.",1
4,"Good value...
  
",29.Oct.18,Yes,Easy setup but booklet was no real help.  Vibrant picture...good sound &amp; volume for a 22 inch tv.  Perfect tv for guest room.,1
1,"I would like to return this item but i threw away the box the night i installed.
  
",7.Dec.18,Yes,"The sound is horrible.  When i put the volume up, the TV talks to you to tell you the number volume i am putting it up to and i cannot hear the sound to know if that is the volume or not... ITS ANNOYING... the sound is never right so you have to adjust the sound often and hear the tv every time you do it... its a good thing i didnt throw away my old tv back.",1
5,"Perfect TV for My Wife's Sewing Room
  
",8.Jan.19,Yes,"I decided that my wife needed to replace the old-fashioned, tube-type TV in her sewing room.  So, I ordered the LG for Christmas.  Why the LG?  It has the best picture of the TV's in my ""man cave"", and the price was right on Amazon.  I was a bit afraid to order a TV online, but it arrived in perfect condition.  She loves it.",0
1,"a Fisher Price toy dressed up as a grown up TV
  
",7.Apr.19,Yes,"Bought this in June, 2018.  By October started having sporadic problems with the port and the signal.Six months later, have already purchased a new TV.  Are they kidding?  LG has some serious problems with its products. What a waste.",0
4,"Center stand for TV very important, the two stand TV's on each side wouldn't fit dresser.
  
",25.Apr.19,Yes,"Bought TV as present for family member.  They were very pleased.  TV was to be mounted on bedroom dresser and it had to be the center stand, newer models had two stands on each side and wouldn't fit on dresser.",0
5,"Great picture and size
  
",9.May.19,Yes,"I wanted a TV to go in my kitchen. I had an off brand that was awful. This 24"" LQ is great. This picture is perfect with a screen size that fits the space. I was not happy when the price dropped $10 the day after I ordered it, but truly it is worth the $99.99 to me. It was super easy to pickup my Dish Network channels.",0
4,"Great picture for a Modest price
  
",14.Jul.19,Yes,This TV replaced a much larger bedroom TV that no longer worked. The clarity and sharp colors on the screen were a huge contrast. Lightweight and easyto move - just perfect.,0
1,"This is not a smart TV
  
",20.Jul.19,Yes,This TV was a total waste of money. Didn't return in time for refund. This TV is completely useless to me. Will end up having to sell it. You can't hook anything up to it. Useless.,0
5,"Fanastic!
  
",5.Sep.19,Yes,"I bought this 24 inch for my bedroom to replace a huge old clunker of a tv.  This is perfect, picture quality and sound is great.",1
1,"I guess we got what we paid for
  
",16.Sep.19,Yes,"Tv sound doesn't work, but can't return because we threw the box out. Didn't expect to have issues with it since we've ordered plenty of things, from Amazon, without issues.",1
5,"Good TV, Low Audio Quality
  
",21.Nov.19,Yes,"It's a great small TV, but it has lousy sound quality. If you are watching a movie you'll need to turn the sound all the way up to 100. For regular TV 60 is about right. I think I'll need a separate speaker for this TV.Picture quality and everything else is great.",0
3,"Okay if you know what you're getting into.  I didn't.
  
",4.Dec.19,Yes,"This TV is okay -- nothing special.  My biggest problem with it is that there are only two ways to hook it up -- HDMI or cable.  Since the point was to hook it up to a DVD player in my office, I had to look for awhile to find one I could actually hook up to the TV.Another problem with it is that the power cord is way too short.  If you want your TV sitting on the floor next to the electrical outlet, this is the TV for you.",0
5,"Perfect RV Television
  
",28.Dec.19,Yes,"Bought this for our little 21 travel trailer and couldn_ be happier.  Crisp picture, decent sound, all in a tight little unit.  It_ perfect.",0
3,"Nice monitors for the money
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,"Great monitors for the money, I would buy again. I bought three for my garage setup. Only thing I don_ like is the power plug and brick. I wish they used the universal power cable for monitors or bricks that were similar to laptop chargers.",0
