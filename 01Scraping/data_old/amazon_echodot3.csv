5,"Better than 2nd Gen!  ***HERE'S HOW TO HELP WITH PRIVACY CONCERNS***
  
",15.Oct.18,Yes,"Sound quality is the best I've heard on a speaker of this size!!!  Definitely worth paying a little extra for this one over the 2nd generation model.  I'm not going to discuss the functionality as there's tons of info already out there.  One important note:  If you set up the Alexa app on your phone, IT WILL IMPORT ALL OF YOUR PHONE CONTACTS. I didn't think I gave it permission to do so but Alexa did indeed import my contacts!  You may have read stories how, WITHOUT YOUR KNOWLEDGE, Alexa can record what's being said in your home and then send it to ANY or ALL of those contacts! Yikes!  And, I won't want any of my kids to accidentally send messages to or call people on my contact list. So, if you want to keep your contacts from Alexa and prevent that from happening here's how I did it:Before installiing the Alexa app on your phone, export your contacts to a file and save it for later. Then, go back to the phone and delete those contacts (don't worry, you'll import them back in later).  Now, install the Alexa app on your phone and go through the set up process. At some point, you'll have the option to allow Alexa to automatically import any additions to your contacts.  Please ""disable"" that option.  After you're done with the installation, you'll notice there are no contacts in your Alexa app!  Now, you can import your contacts back into your phonebook using the file that you initially created and you're good to go!If you already installed the app but want to delete your contacts from Alexa, it's not too late.  Simply export your phone contacts to a file and save for later.  Then, delete the contacts from your phone.  Now, open the Alexa app and click ""Contacts.""  On the Contacts page, click on ""Import Contacts"" and enable it by moving the button to the right side.  This will cause Alexa to replace your existing contacts with the now empty phonebook.  After a few minutes, your Alexa contacts will be gone.  Go back and disable ""Import Contacts"" to prevent Alexa from importing them in the future.  You can now import the contact file that you created back into your phone.Of course there may be some contacts you do want to use with Alexa.  I simply added them manually by clicking ""Add Contact.""I hope this info is helpful as I wasn't able to find an easy way to manage Alexa contacts.","7,857"
4,"Love the Dot and its new look, but the sound is still disappointing
  
",15.Oct.18,Yes,"I've been a happy owner of a 2nd generation Echo and three 2nd generation Echo Dots for a year now, and I was glad to add this to the arsenal.  After using it for a few days I am generally pleased with it, but it does have limitations, especially when it comes to sound quality (no surprise there!).  I will start by summarizing what's new about the 3rd Generation Dot, then I'll describe the device in more detail, and finally I'll add some thoughts about how to choose which Echo device may be best for you.The most obvious update to the Dot is the new look: it's as if someone took a 2nd generation Dot, inflated it with an air pump, and wrapped the edge in fabric.  And it's not bad!What's different/updated in the 3rd Generation Dot:1) It is slightly larger than the 2nd generation device, measuring 3.9"" wide x 1.7"" tall (2nd gen was 3.3"" wide x 1.3"" tall), and the top and bottom edges are more rounded.  It is also substantially heavier at nearly twice the weight of the 2nd generation model.2) The 2nd generation Dot came in two color options (black and white), each of which had a shiny plastic exterior that I personally thought looked a little cheap.  The 3rd generation Dot has a fabric exterior which gives it a classier appearance, and it's available in three colors: heather grey, sandstone, and charcoal.  The fabric and rounded edges give the 3rd generation Dot a much softer look than its predecessor.4) The 3rd generation Dot has a larger speaker (1.6"", versus 1.1"" on the 2nd gen), which is paired with a larger driver as well.  I'll talk below about the effect this has on audio quality.5) The placement of the microphones is slightly different: while the 2nd generation had seven small far-field microphones on its top surface; the 3rd generation has four microphones.---------------------------Overall appearance---------------------------I purchased the ""sandstone"" version. The cloth is a polyester woven fabric made up of lighter and darker shades which gives it more visual interest than if it were just a solid, uniform gray. The neutral color blends in with nearly any decor, and the cloth gives the unit a softer look which is great for areas of your house where you don't want something that screams ""I'm a device!""Aside from its larger size and slight convex bulge, the top of the device is nearly identical to that of the 2nd generation Dot: it has four buttons (volume up, volume down, microphone off, and an ""action"" button) and a multi-colored light ring around the top edge that tells you about the Echo's status.  The side of the device has an input for the power cable and a 3.5-mm output jack.One notable improvement is the shape of the power cable, which sits flatter against the wall than the 2nd generation Dot's cable (see my photo to see them side by side).  This may sound like an insignificant change, but it makes a huge difference if you want to plug the cable into an outlet that is behind a piece of furniture.-------------Setup-------------Setting up the Dot couldn't be easier.  You simply plug in the power cable, then use the Alexa app on your phone to connect the Dot to your WiFi network.  The app leads you through everything, and the whole process takes less than a minute.  Boom.----------------Audio----------------I did a side-by-side audio comparison of the 2nd and 3rd Generation Echo Dots, first with music (orchestral, a jazz combo, and some AC/DC) and then with a few newscasts.  Everything does sound better on the 3rd generation Dot, but to be honest, the sound is still pretty anemic.  Compared with the 2nd generation Dot, the sound is slightly fuller, not as annoyingly tinny, and has a small amount of bass presence (not much, but the 2nd generation had none).  Newscasts and other spoken texts benefit from the fuller sound as well, but the difference is more pronounced with music.  Just for fun, I also compared the 3rd generation Dot with my 2nd generation Echo, and THAT'S where I noticed a big difference.  Yes, the new Dot sounds a bit better than its predecessor, but they both sound weak compared to the full-sized Echo.  (To its credit, Amazon doesn't claim that the Dot has room-filling sound.)I'll be blunt: I really like the Dot, but I don't use it to listen to music.  At all.  With so many other speaker options out there, there's just no reason to use this as your primary music device.-------------------------Voice recognition-------------------------As I mentioned above, the number of microphones on the top surface has dropped from seven to four.  I'm not sure what the rationale for this was, but after testing the Dot's ability to pick up my voice from different distances and angles, I didn't notice a substantial difference in the overall microphone sensitivity compared to the 2nd generation Dot.  Like the other Echo devices, though, it seems to have more difficulty detecting voices that come from below it (which happens if I talk to it while I'm on the floor playing with my daughter).-------------------Functionality-------------------The bottom line is that the overall functionality -- what the 3rd generation Dot ""does"" -- is nearly identical to that of the previous generations (and of other Echo devices, or at least the ones without screens).  This is largely because the Alexa assistant software on which all Echos operate is run on Amazon's cloud, not your individual device.  This means that as Amazon adds new features and updates to Alexa they automatically become available on all Echo devices.  So, you can use any of them to:- Stream music via WiFi from multiple sources- Control smart home devices with your voice- Make hands-free calls to other Echo devices or phone numbers in North America- Make purchases from your Amazon Prime account- Listen to news feeds, podcasts, etc.- Do anything else in Alexa's ever-growing skill set, such as make shopping lists, set timers/alarms/reminders, play games, tell you your daily schedule, and any other skills Amazon dreams up for Alexa in the future.If you don't want to use the Dot's built-in speaker, you can connect it to your own speakers via Bluetooth or by using the 3.5-mm output jack.One new feature for the 3rd generation Dot is a little puzzling to me: You can pair two Echo Dots in a ""stereo mode,"" giving you essentially left and right speakers.  I tried this briefly and the results were pretty much what I expected: yes, it's stereo, but it's still weak sound!  You can also pair an Echo Sub with the Dots, creating a little 2.1 sound system.  Frankly, I'm not sure why you would do this; if I were setting up for stereo sound, I would want speakers that are designed for decent audio performance, not two Echo Dots.Alexa's skill set is enormous and always growing.  In fact, part of the fun of owning an Echo device is seeing what new skills Amazon comes up with (even if many new skills are just silly or entertaining).  I'll mention two of my favorite skills here: the Flash Briefing and the drop-in feature. The flash briefing is fully customizable daily digest of news and other information which you can hear any time by asking ""What's my flash briefing?"" There is a huge list of content you can add to your briefing including news updates, weather forecasts, sports and traffic updates, and educational snippets along with many that are just humorous or entertaining. Using the Alexa phone app or your Echo account page you can select exactly what content you want in your briefing and in what order you want to hear it. For example, I configured mine with news feeds from NPR, BBC, and Reuters. I love having an on-demand synopsis of the latest news from my favorite sources.My other favorite feature, ""drop in,"" essentially opens a two-way communication channel between any two Echo devices, sort of like an intercom. Simply ask Alexa to ""drop in on [the living room, the kitchen...]"" and you are instantly connected. My wife and I use this feature to communicate from opposite ends of the house. You can turn drop-in capability on or off for each of your Echo devices individually, and you can also choose whether each device can drop in with ANY Echo device or only those in your own home.[Note that the drop-in feature is NOT the same thing as Alexa's hands-free calling feature. Hands-free calling allows you to call most phone numbers and Echo devices in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada from your Echo by saying your contact's name or number. Just like with a phone call, the other person must choose to answer your call before you can communicate. By contrast, with the drop-in feature communication is instantly established. For this reason you will probably want to use drop-in only with your closest family and friends, and probably only for certain rooms in your home!]-----------------------------------A few (minor) complaints-----------------------------------Unfortunately this 3rd Generation Dot shares an annoying trait of its predecessors: widely varying volume levels within the daily Flash Briefing. As you listen to the briefing, some components (such as BBC News) come through quietly while others (like Reuters) are much louder.  Not a deal-breaker, but slightly annoying.Also, occasionally when Alexa misunderstands a command, you have to ""start over,"" which can be really irritating.  For example, if Alexa thinks you asked to turn on a light but you really asked something else, she will repeatedly say ""In which room?"" until you say ""Alexa, stop"" and then start over.  I'm guessing this type of thing will improve over time as voice recognition software  becomes more advanced.  This is really more of an Alexa issue than a Dot issue, but it drives me nuts at times.Finally, I wish the Alexa phone app was easier to use.  It works, but its organization is not intuitive and it feels rather clunky to navigate.  Again, this is more of an ""Alexa"" issue than a ""Dot"" issue, but still... Hopefully Amazon will continue to make improvements to it!--------------A few tips--------------1) The Dot seems to pick up voices best when placed at or below eye level (i.e., roughly the level from which your voice emits). Mine has trouble detecting voices coming from below it, so I don't recommend placing this on a high shelf.2) When you select news feeds for your Flash briefing I recommend picking one U.S. source and one international source (I use NPR and BBC - both are excellent). If you add too many feeds you'll get a lot of overlap and hear the same story several times.3) If you have multiple Echo devices in your home, sometimes speaking to one will cause others to respond as well, especially if they are in close proximity (like in adjacent rooms). One way to prevent this is to change the wake word of one of the devices to ""Echo"" or ""Amazon."" The only downside is that you then have to remember which wake word you assigned to each device!------------------------------------------------------------------------Echo Dot vs. Echo vs. Echo Plus: Which one to buy?------------------------------------------------------------------------(Please note that I am only comparing Echo devices that do NOT have screens.)When choosing between the Echo Dot and one of the larger Echo devices, perhaps the most important question to ask is ""How much do you plan to LISTEN to the device?""  This question is important because one of the biggest differences between the Echo Dot and the larger Echo devices is sound quality: the 1.6"" speaker of the Dot simply cannot match the fullness and heft of the Echo or Echo Plus.  (Remember, they all run on the same Alexa software, which means they all have nearly identical skill sets!)So, if you don't currently own an Echo device, start by thinking carefully about how you plan to use it.  Many Alexa skills fall into one of two broad categories: those that rely heavily on the speaker and those that don't.  For example, features that benefit from good sound quality include playing music/newscasts/podcasts, the drop-in feature, and hands-free calling.  (This is why I chose an Echo Plus for my kitchen - I use it every morning to listen to the news.)  If you plan to use your device largely for these type of features, you would probably appreciate the better sound of the Echo or Echo Plus.On the other hand, if plan to use the Echo mainly for ""non-listening"" purposes such as voice-controlling your smart home devices, then the sound quality isn't as important and a Dot is probably all you need.  In fact, you could even save some money by purchasing a 2nd generation Dot instead -- especially if it's not going to be in a highly visible location or you don't mind its shiny plastic look.  I have several ""single-purpose"" Dots in my house in rooms where I want to voice-control one thing, such as a lamp in the room, and 2nd generations Dots are just fine for this -- and now that their price has gone down they are a great value!==========Bottom line==========The Echo Dot is an extraordinarily useful and versatile device -- one that becomes more useful all the time as Alexa's skill set expands.  The 3rd Generation model has a great new look, but despite marginal improvements in the speaker, it's still pretty unsatisfying as a playback device for music or  newscasts.  As long as you are willing to accept its acoustic limitations, the Dot can be a wonderful device to have in your home.  And if you DO want better sound quality for the features you use most often, you can always connect the Dot to your own sound system via Bluetooth or the 3.5-mm audio jack.  Hope this was helpful!","10,747"
3,"Overall improvement, but lost its flexibility
  
",15.Oct.18,Yes,"I have 5 Echo Dots (gen 2) and we use them throughout the house for just about everything, being we have a fairly smart home. What I liked about the gen 2 versions, were that they were compact and very flexible on how you could use them. They were easy to mount in different positions and being that they used a fairly standard USB interface for the power, you could really be flexible on how and where you mounted them. The one thing that they really missed on? The well known sound quality.Enter the Gen 3...I really like the improvement in sound. Sure it is not a high quality speaker system, but for the size it is pretty good. Especially when you consider that you can pair them and add a sub for pretty good sound. The look is improved over the gen 2, however it does lose a little bit of the customability that the gen 2 had. With the gen 2, you could purchase different wraps, stands, clock mounts, wall mounts, etc. You could really customize it. The gen 3 is a bit bigger and has a much more rounded shape. While it makes it look better by itself, it lacks the ability to really customize it. It surely would not work as a power socket mount, like you could do with the gen 2, just due to the additional weight.That is before you get to the horrendous power cord and adapter. The power adapter is twice as big as the gen 2 and the power cord went away from the, easy to find, usb style cord to a old style input style and it is permanently attached to the power adapter. This is really my biggest complaint as it took away so much flexibility, that you could enjoy with the gen 2. Don't get me wrong, I am sure there will be several new cords and adapters put out to fill the gap, but that is not as easy as using cords many already have. Just makes no sense. Not to mention the cord is really long, so in areas where you want it to be a bit more discreet, this thing sticks out like a sore thumb.What I like...Sound Quality is a step upSound Volume is much improvedBase look is much improvedWhat I dislike...Much less flexibility on how it is used versus previous versionNon-standard power cordBulky adapterUgly long cord","1,107"
1,"Distorted trebles (highs)!!!
  
",15.Oct.18,Yes,"When playing music, sometimes the sound seems distorted specially the highs (trebles).  If it happens i have to tell alexa to change music. But after several minutes it will be distorted again.I just got it yesterday, I will observe it if it still does that I may have to return  it. I_ very disappointed.",410
5,"Much better audio quality!
  
",15.Oct.18,Yes,"This version of the dot is the first one I would recommend to someone who is interested in a smart speaker but not willing to spend much. The biggest drawback to the previous generation was the sound quality/loudness. I use my echoes mostly for controlling connected devices and listening to podcasts, so I felt like the older echo dot was OK for most things I would require. But even for casual music listening, it wasn't up to snuff. The new one actually has bass and sounds good to me, but it's not going to sound like a Sonos or anything and I'm not an audiophile but I do think this will satisfy the majority of people's expectations for $50. I also have the $100 full size Echo from 2017 and the new echo dot has about 65% of the sound quality and loudness of that model vs the older dot having about 15% of the sound quality of the full size echo. I have been using this new dot for a few days without any issues. I love it and I think you should get one!",78
5,"Great improvements
  
",15.Oct.18,Yes,"The unit is a little bigger than before amazing sound and I like the new look. Power wise you don_ have the USB option anymore just regular plug,",31
5,"My first Echo Dot
  
",15.Oct.18,Yes,"I've waited for a smart home speaker for some time because I wasn't sure which one I should get. Since there are a few to consider. I chose the Echo Dot Alexa for a few reasons. It has a ton of support for smart devices and they have many app skills to pick. The sound quality is great! I was really surprised by how much sound comes for this little device. I am hard of hearing and wear hearing aids and I am very pleased with the sound. I am having a great time connecting it to some of my devices like my Xbox One, Bluetooth headsets, and speaker system. I plan on ordering smart plugs to control my lamps and fan for starters and may look into an Alexa controlled smart TV. All I can say is that Amazon has really made a great upgrade to the previous versions. It was part of the reasons why I picked this one. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a small smart speaker with the ability to control devices and a great assistant.",23
5,"Love it!
  
",15.Oct.18,Yes,"Much improvement over the last gen in sound quality. I currently own 5 different echo devices and use the dot for the bathroom but the second gen was a little underwhelming during a shower. But, that is no longer an issue. Now if we can just get some decent 3rd party wall or socket mounts for this thing and I'll be set.",9
5,"It's hard to imagine better...
  
",15.Oct.18,Yes,"This is my first experience with an Alexa-enabled internet connected device.  I love it.  I no longer understand why anyone would spend more than twice as much on an internet-connected radio when you can get this small package with similar connectivity and surprisingly good sound quality.I had an internet radio, which I really liked, but it was three times the price and had less functionality.  For listening to the news or even music at a regular volume in a regular-sized room, this does more, costs less, and is sleek and relatively good looking.As others have mentioned it could (and probably will at some point) come in a wider variety of colors, but beyond that it's hard to imagine it being better for the size.The one thing that could be annoying is that the lights stay on unless you instruct Alexa not to disturb you.  But then you lose the notifications capability.  For me, that's not an issue, hence the five stars.",4
5,"Great Sound from a Tiny Speaker With the same options of the first gen.
  
",15.Oct.18,Yes,Loved the fuller sound. The only thing I hated is that the plug it plugs into takes up a whole regular outlet.,7
5,"Seriously impressive for the size
  
",15.Oct.18,Yes,"Get 2!  The stereo pairing is impressive.  I don't have the sub (yet) - but can say the sound quality is really quite good and an immeasurable improvement over the prior Dot's.  If you have your existing dots plugged into external speakers this may not be that big a deal - but if you're using the original Dot standalone - DO NOT HESITATE... No this is not audiophile quality, but seriously impressive for the size.  I would say the sound is equivalent to what the Tap is able to do.",4
4,"Power Connector is different from Generation 2
  
",15.Oct.18,Yes,"Typical Echo Dot. Looks cool and sounds great. Unfortunately this generation 3 uses a different power connector. Prior generations used a Micro USB and I need to use a much shorter power cord connected to a Din Rail power supply. Any idea what voltage and exactly what type of power plug these new devices use?? I can figure it out on my own but if somebody already has this info, you'll save me some research time.  This generation uses a push in round power connector. --Greg--",3
5,"works great so far
  
",15.Oct.18,Yes,"I bought the dot to control a smart light in a bedroom.  I also bought the new echo plus as a hub.  I installed the echo, got the light up and running, and waited for the dot to arrive (I didn't order it soon enough to get it opening day).The dot arrived, I plugged it in, and it was good to go - I didn't have to do anything.  I just asked alexa to turn the light off and off it went.  In the middle of the night I asked alexa to play a prime music ""sleep"" playlist I like, and it started right up.  I know it can do much more, but those are the two most important things to me and they work great so far.",2
2,"Slightly louder but not as good as Google Home mini
  
",16.Oct.18,Yes,"I was excited when they said it had a better speaker as the echo dot's are disappointingly quiet. Meanwhile the google home mini of the same size is VERY loud and crisp. This new version the 3.0...is somewhere in the middle. A little louder but not quite enough. I was hoping to have one in the kitchen and have it play my audio books while i clean/cook, but its still difficult to hear ti clearly over the kitchen activity. No such problem with the google home mini. Also a downside, they changed the charge port to an old fashioned pin style instead of the micro USB. This limits the places I can use it I have a small powered hub in the living room I connect my devices too and I was going to get another one of these for that, but I won't now since I can't connect it easily where I want to.  I also used to bring one onto the back patio and have it powered by my Anker usb battery, but I can't do that with this one anymore. Not sure why they suddenly abandoned the micro usb style. It can easily meet the 15 watt demand the 3.0 requires.Also if you need/want a wall mount for this version, you can get one to print on thingiverse.UPDATE:Within a few minutes of leaving this review I got multiple calls from Amazon asking me to explain my review....not offering to take it back or to exchange it or solve anything for me...but asking me to explain myself.  The girl by the end of the call seemed nice enough, but the fact that within a few minutes of a review I got multiple calls on my personal cell asking me to ""explain myself"" seems almost like they're trying to intimidate you away from giving an honest review.  Especially since I think I gave all the relevant details in my review.  Afterwards I was kind of thinking...is this like a modern ""mafia thing? Are my orders going to arrived busted up or just go missing now?","1,768"

",16.Oct.18,Yes,"When I first plugged in this new echo (with the large &amp; rather obtrusive wall plug others have spoken of) I noticed that the light ring on the echo was noticeably dimmer than the previous generation.  After some back &amp; forth with amazon support, they swapped out my unit, and upon connecting the replacement I noticed that the light ring changes its brightness depending on the amount of ambient light present. There is no mention of this feature anywhere, and amazon wouldn_ confirm that it has this feature, but I can plainly see the difference when I turn on or off a desk lamp which shines right over the echo dot.This is a welcome feature improvemnt over the previous generation, as the light ring become less obnoxious at night, but I wish this was a feature I could turn on or off with the app, or had some control over the sensitivity, as it can be hard to see the light ring if it_ dimmed too much.Other than this one issue and the overly large wall adapter, it_ a great upgrade over the previous generation.",2

",17.Oct.18,Yes,"I had no idea I'd love Alexa so much - I wake up in the morning and she does the routine I've set up, and she's so comforting and useful and fun overall.  My husband and I played Skills trivia games for hours last night.  If we had kids it would be even more super useful (kids workouts, stories, games) - we even had a goodnight story read to us by Alexa and it was awesome.  I'm really loving it.  The Echo Dot itself is pretty great - the sound quality is pretty good, the bass when turned up is not that great, but if you really want to rock out you can connect it to other speakers or just use something else instead.  I'm really surprised by how much I like the Alexa app (and the Echo Dot), because I'm a little resistant to technology, but it's pretty easy to figure out and feels like a new little buddy in the home.  I'm excited to get some SmartHome stuff now so I can turn on/off lights, heat, etc.  The only tiny issue I have is that for some reason Alexa doesn't pick up my husband's voice as much as it does mine - maybe because I've used it more?  Really cool, though, overall - I feel like Judy Jetson!","2,138"
5,"Actually impressed.
  
",17.Oct.18,Yes,"I was debating between this and the regular echo. I've had both and we both know what the echo does so all I'll talk about is the sound quality.I'm going to get to the chase. This is the BEST speaker I've ever heard for under $50. The functions of the echo along with the music playing functionality and the sound quality makes it a steal at this price point.The sound is great for its size. It can get pretty loud but the bass is definitely lacking. The bass isn't god awful but it just isn't there.Now I will say this... if your primary motivation for a speaker is to listen to music, go with the echo. If it is but your budget is under $50 then go with the dot. It won't blow anyone away during a get together in your living room but it'll get the job done. The dot will only flourish is an enclosed space. It needs walls nearby to bounce off to cover up the weakness of the bass.If I had to compare the sound to another speaker, I'd say the UE Wonderboom or the older Beats Pill, all of which suffer from weak bass. For the size, I was impressed by the sound but with the Echo at its refurbished price of $69 I'll have to aim towards that direction.I'd recommend this for someone who needs an echo for their kitchen, bedroom or bathroom. It's just not going to hold down a living room unfortunately but overall, I like the sound and if I need a second echo, I'll definitely get a dot.","1,146"

",17.Oct.18,Yes,"Traded in the first gen dot to this one. Big difference in sound quality. I am using this one in my office where I mostly listen to NPR, Podcasts or Audio books.

The downside is a poorly designed power plug which makes me wonder what Amazon engineers were thinking.  This should be redesigned quickly.  It_ way too big.

1,"Bad design, IMHO
  
",18.Oct.18,Yes,"Very disappointing.  Alexis sounded like she was under a thick blanket.  After talking with customer service, we tried various things which did not help.  They said send it back and they sent another which I received in two days.  It seemed a little better but not much.  I have two 2nd gen echo dots and they are fine.  I found both 3rd gens to have a very muddy bass sound on music and the high end sounds frequently were slightly distorted.  Alexis' voice was so muffled that her voice was unintelligible at times.  I sent the second one back for a refund and bought a second gen echo which is just fine.  I think they got the design wrong on this one.  In trying to make it sound fuller for music, they actually made the sound less clear and sharp.I must add that the customer service experience was a very pleasant one.",234
2,"Multi-Room Setup Doesn_ Work
  
",18.Oct.18,Yes,"I bought this product to set up a multi room music system with my current Echo Dots. Currently, the app is being really buggy and won_ let me set up the multi-room group. Once you select one device, it automatically says the other devices cannot be reached. So annoying! Please fix this bug Amazon.",213
3,"Stereo pairing isn't the greatest
  
",18.Oct.18,Yes,"Just bought 2 of these.  I've had a few 2nd generation Echo dots around my house for a year now.  I was interested in the new dot both for the improved sound as well as the stereo pairing.  The sound is indeed significantly better, perhaps almost rivaling my Google Home.  They are much louder as well.  I would have skipped getting the pair.  Pairing them as a pair was pretty simple.  They will only both play though if you ask them to play something off a service like Amazon Music or Spotify.  I often use one of the sleep sounds Alexa skills at night and figured having a speaker on each side of my bed would create a more enveloping sound.  Unfortunately, it only plays out of 1 speaker.  Also, if I ask it to play a radio station it will play out of both speakers, but when I use it to wake me up in the morning with that same station it only plays out of one. I hear it's kind of the same deal with the sub. I'm tempted to return one of them since the use as a pair is pretty limited.I thought maybe I could just use a few Sonos One, but they can't do timed actions like alarms.Edit:  Impressively, I posted this review in the morning and Amazon called to discuss it with me that afternoon to see what feedback I had on the Dots.  I was pretty impressed that they are that on top of their reviews.",50
1,"Muffled
  
",18.Oct.18,Yes,"I bought this to replace my old Echo Dot gen 2. I am very disappointed. Alexa sounds distant and muffled. Music playback and the alarms sound normal. There is something wrong when she speaks and I have to turn the echo dot up. Only problem is, when the alarm goes off in the mornings it_ super loud. Wish they would add new volume settings is this is going to be the norm going forward. Also, very disappointed in Amazon customer service. I was supposed to have a call back yesterday morning between 8:30am-9:3am CST and it never happened. I will be requesting a replacement device and I_ leaving this bad review in part because of the failed customer service promise.",41
5,"Alexa
  
",18.Oct.18,Yes,"Not sure why i waited so long, this makes turning off lights and fans and TV's a breeze. (smart plugs needed)",42
5,"Much better sound then the 2nd Gen Dot
  
",18.Oct.18,Yes,Just got my 3rd Gen Dot and this speaker is loud especially if you have the volume turned to max. Alexa's voice is loudest but music can still get loud as well especially if the volume is maxed. Lots of base sound. Great for Ocean and Waterfall recordings. I prefer music not to have to much base so I can turn base off in the equalizer settings via the Alexa App and turn Treble and the other sound setting to max and music sounds much better.I did some testingUltimate Seashore by enviroments sounds good on the Dot 3rd Gen. You can hear each breaker and the very distant foghorn really good.Thomas Dolby's Blinded Me With Science I use this song to test midrange sound and it sounds good on the dot 3rd gen.With this Dot you can hear the music and not require an additional speaker. I will be using this when I'm showering so I can hear the music while the shower is going. If you want though you have the option to add a Bluetooth Speaker or a Wired 35mm Cable Speaker to the Dot 3rd Gen. Amazon has really improved this Echo Dot and it sounds slightly better then the Google Home Mini.I recommend the Dot 3rd Gen and it's really at a good price of $50 if you don't want to spend a lot on an Echo Smart Speaker. It can't compete with the more expensive echo room filling speakers but it's a pretty good speaker for it's size.The Dot 3rd Gen also works with your smart home devices and routines. I tested that as well on my lights. The Dot has 4 microphones and it really can hear you better then the 2nd Generation Dot.I recommend the Dot 3rd Gen.,10
4,"Great speaker for Music
  
",18.Oct.18,Yes,I liked the speakers improved quality for Music but for the dialogue it was more clear in the older version. My wife did not like it at all. Unfortunately I had to return it with a heavy heart.,13

",18.Oct.18,Yes,"Biggest piece of garbage amazon has ever sold!!!! Purchased one a week ago and didn_ work, amazon replaced immediately. Same issue will not stay connected to internet.

Will not buy again, will return this one and DO NOT recommend this product at all!,,,",10
5,"My first Echo.... 2 thumbs up
  
",18.Oct.18,Yes,"Without a doubt - it's quite an impressive creature.  It's not pefect...but no tech is perfect... and I love tech.  So...  Amazon added whisper mode today.  Experiencing that today - was one of those very special ""wow"" moments.... I called my friends to try out that new feature...and they all love it.  It does much more than I expected.  For quite a while I waited, as I thought ""I have my iPhone and Siri...why do I need Alexa?""  Well, I love my iPhone... and am still very happy I now have an echo dot.  I don't have any complaints-  just look forward to the continued advancements Amazon's Echo team is making with the device.  The quality of the device is excellent - and the sound it puts out- for its size... really impressive.  Can I live it out it?  Sure.... But is it fun and convenient to have.... absolutely.  Very glad I finally got one!",5
5,"Echo Dot for Amazon Music
  
",18.Oct.18,Yes,"I have been enjoying the Amazon Music BUT the albums and selections I selected on Amazon Music do not always play upon my request and at times some music I do not like starts playing!  Also, the one Echo Dot is all I have and I only want to subscribe to the $3.99/ month option and it will not let me!",7
5,"Great dot
  
",18.Oct.18,Yes,I like it better than the 2nd gen dot and  echo. Glad I waited for it to be released. Now I need a battery base for it.,6

",18.Oct.18,Yes,Quality product. Simple setup with phone app. Decent sound quality but don_ expect much from such a small speaker. Used mine to pair to all Sonos in the house and works great.,4
5,"The voice response has improved significantly!
  
",19.Oct.18,Yes,"So far so good!  The voice recognition is better.  I don_ have to say Alexa multiple times for it to work.  This one hears me everytime, the first time.  The sound is much better so far.",225
1,"Multi Room Music functionality is completely unreliable.
  
",19.Oct.18,Yes,"Multiple chat supports with amazon to figure out why echo dots will randomly stop playing music across the house.  Absolutely no improvement as a result of support.  Apparently this is rare according to chat support; however, plenty of people report the issue.  These devices should be convenient but are extremely frustrating due to randomly stopping.  Sometimes 1 device, sometimes 2.  I ended up returning all 3 after the issue never resolved itself and support wasn't able to suggest a fix or even a reason as to why it was happening.The concept of what these are supposed to be is awesome, but they aren't reliable.  I wish a 1/2 star was possible here.",81

I will say Alexa .... the light will come on, in a second it will turn off. or I will give the command super fast before the unit when to sleep mode.. and no respond. very frustrating to deal with this crap. I send it back. if you want to get frustrated, then buy this unit.",9
5,"Fantastic Upgrade
  
",19.Oct.18,Yes,"As a user of the 2nd Gen. Echo Dot, I can tell you that Gen. 3 is the one you want if you don't use an external speaker system. The sound is much sharper and cleaner than previous versions and even music sounds better on it. What I like about the Echo Dot is that you can pair it with another Dot to play music in stereo without the use of Bluetooth or directly connected speakers. A worthy upgrade.",1
5,"Perfect
  
",19.Oct.18,Yes,"I didn't think I would ever get an Alexa, why I live in a tiny house.  But it works great.  I don't leave the TV on IHeart radio on anymore, my light goes on in the loft when I open the door.  And a great alarm wakes me in the morning.  I love this little gadget... Toys for adults... And this one is sweet",1

",20.Oct.18,Yes,"So we have 4 of the second generation dots and was excited to see the new one. Set up was super fast, sound and looks great!  Can_ wait for the Black Friday special where I can add a few more in the house. Want a cool stand?, we used an old bath and body candle stand, works perfect and looks great!",550
4,"A HUGE improvement in sound quality from previous gen
  
",20.Oct.18,Yes,"I had the 2nd gen Dot every since i came out, I never used it to play music, because the speaker quality was just not fit to play music.  Then yesterday I got this new 3d gen Dot, and gosh, not only the sound quality improved, the volume also improved! I got chemical burn on my private part from hair removal cream due to i didn't hear the timer on my 2nd gen dot, but the 3rd gen is so loud that you'll hear it for sure! The speaker quality on the 3rd gen dot is really good, i would even say it is better than my 2nd gen Eco!!! The sound from this 3rd gen Dot is loud, but smooth, unlike the 2nd gen Eco which hurts your ears when playing at loud volume and sounds are all distorted. I would def play music on this 3rd gen Dot from now, cuz it sounds good enough for listening music and won't sounds like if you were listening music on your great grandfather's handheld radio thingy. Oh also the look of this device is much better than the previous one as well. The previous one looks like if it was only $20.... but the look on this one at least $50 lolThe only reason i gave it a 4 star is because when playing music around volume 8-10 it can't hear me calling her name, and i have to scream on the top of my lung( like if someone were to stab me kinda scream) for her to hear me. So now i just walk to her and control her instead of using my voice cuz i'm too weak to scream to her multiple times a day.",115

4,"new echo added to the family
  
",20.Oct.18,Yes,"This is not my first echo dot. I've bought many in the past and enjoy placing them around my home. Don't get me wrong, they're great for simply asking the weather, turning on the thermostat, turning off the lights, or any other features you might find useful. The new and improved speaker is definitely better than that of its predecessor, however, the bass and treble still seem to be off. The app is now more convenient to maneuver and find the controls for your home.I will still continue to setup smart home groups, and use them for multi-room audio. I look forward to receiving my other echo products shortly. Amazon has reinforced their lineup, and I'm proud to be their consumer. I've only had this device for a week, so I'll periodically update on here after I experiment with the device more.",4
2,"Can't Connect 3rd Generation Dot to my music group
  
",20.Oct.18,Yes,"I have 6 Dots, four Echos, two Shows and one Tap. I conduct a lot of training for Occupational Therapist on the benefits of a smart home. I have been able to setup all of my devices (except the Tap for obvious reasons) to be able to play music throughout my home.  All of these were straight forward to connect together. However, I cannot connect the new 3rd generation Dot I got on October 11 (I preordered it when it was announced in September). I don't know what i am doing wrong, but the setup was just like all of the others - same Wi-Fi network and using the new Alexa smart phone interface. This is also the case for my Android and iPads. On top of all of this, the Help selector on the smart phone interface does not work, so it does not give me any assistance. Perhaps this was rushed to market too soon.",2
4,"My first Dot. I went and got a second one too!
  
",20.Oct.18,Yes,"I am making an effort to be more tech savy, so tbh I am easily impressed. But I love my dot. I talk to Alexa all the time. I enjoy having by phone sync so that I can listen to podcasts and music while I'm getting ready. I set alarms for work, add things to my to do and my shopping lists that I can then see in my Alexa Ap. I have Sirius XM and I upgraded my subscription to be able to use it with my dot. I found out a week later that they were having a promotion for a free dot if you upgraded your subscription, so I cashed that in and received a second dot for free! I have one in my living room and one in the bedroom. Everything the dot does is something my phone could do, but I like that I don't have to use my battery and that everything is voice controlled. I was very interested in trying out the google home devices, but now that I have two amazon devices I think I'll just stick with Alexa.",0
5,"Attractive with great voice
  
",20.Oct.18,Yes,I have a second generation. I'm giving my daughter I had it hooked to an external speaker which work good for that one this one really doesn't need an external speaker it's got great sound I have 2/3 Generations now one of my bedroom one of my office and I have the big echo in my living room echoing all over the place haha the great item I love it going to get one for the car too,2
4,"Man, does this thing use a lot of bandwidth!
  
",20.Oct.18,Yes,"Streaming on any other device slows to a crawl when this item is functioning. I like its responses most of the time. There are times it thinks I asked it to turn off the lights (none are connected) but that might be the way I ask it to perform. I've only tried a few skills and they all seem to have flaws, usually with sound quality. I think overall it's a good product, but the bandwidth issue needs to be fixed.",1
5,"Great addition for small home office or bedroom etc
  
",21.Oct.18,Yes,"So I have never purchased an Echo yet till this point. I am working on my AWS Certified Solutions Architect and got to the point to write programs that will use the Echo. I did not want to spend a lot, but was also hoping to get at least fairly good sound. I had heard the earlier versions of the Dot and was not impressed. But the reviews on this one seem pretty good, so I got it. I can say I am duly impressed. The bass response is a bit lacking, however the sound is clear with a pretty decent frequency response. I work from home and this will definitely sit in my home office for background music. I love that I can easily get things like the current weather and temp just by asking. I am also looking forward to programming some other features to use with the Echo too.I can also see putting this in a bedroom, or a kitchen, or other secondary room in the house. It is more than loud enough to hear while working in the kitchen. And it would give good enough sound to go to sleep by, then wake up and find out the temp outside before even getting out of bed. I am hoping to program it so I can check on school closings at the same time I get the weather in the morning.If you are a very critical audiophile this is not the device for you. But if you just want some good sound akin to a really good clock radio or small portable radio I think you will be more than satisfied.Oh and I LOVE the dad jokes Alexa tells when you ask for a joke!",2
5,"Quantum Leap in sound over 2nd Generation Dot
  
",21.Oct.18,Yes,"Got the new 3rd generation Dot over the weekend to see how it compared with the 2nd generation Dots I already have. I was not disappointed! The sound quality is MUCH improved, sounding closer to an Echo (but without the bass) than its predecessor. I placed it in the kitchen and was pleased with how well I can hear it announce timers and reminders when I_ in the living room. It seamlessly integrated with the other 18 Alexa units we have (2 Shows 6 Echos 3 Spots and 7 Dots) and collaborates in two music groups without any issues. Before, the Dot was a good entry level for just using Alexa, but now with improved sound quality, it contributes to music groups with greater fidelity.",1
5,"My first Echo device and I love it
  
",21.Oct.18,Yes,This is my first echo purchase and I think I_ hooked. Just moved back from Europe and as I was unpacking it was a pain to stop and change a Sirius station on my phone. Echo dot to the rescue! I had a problem at first setting it up but once I did it_ been amazing. I can switch from listening to Howard on Sirius to asking Alexa to play classical and than to 80_ music. Every morning she tells me a joke and than we start unpacking. I was also very impressed with the sound and how loud she actually plays. Very impressive for such a small speaker,1
5,"We've been enjoying it!
  
",21.Oct.18,Yes,"My husband and I have been having so much with this. Figuring out all the stuff it can do is an adventure. The sound quality isn't great, but we hooked it up to a speaker system and it works very well. The app leave a lot to be desired, I wish it was easier to navigate and had a little more guidance. Switching between user profiles was as easy as telling Alexa to ""switch profiles/accounts,"" but it took us two days to figure that out.. I'm learning that sometimes the most obvious is the way to go.",0
4,"Works fine -- note equalizer controls
  
",22.Oct.18,Yes,"It's louder with better bass response compared with the 2nd generation Dot that I also have. I listen to a lot of speech and that sounded muddy compared to 2nd gen. I learned from technical support that equalizer controls are avialable. They are accessed as follows:1. In the Alexa App, tap on the Devices icon at the bottom-right2.Tap on Echo &amp; Alexa at the top-left corner3. Down below, tap on your Echo Dot4. Down below, tap on ""Sounds""5. Then tap on the Equalizer -- here you can adjust the Bass / Mid / TrebleTurning the bass way down and boosting the midrange helped a lot. It sounds more natural and is not as tinny as the 2nd gen model. Speech quality is not great but it's OK. For the price I think the sound quality is fine.One problem I note is that the volume steps when using voice volume control (""Alexa louder,"" ""Alexa softer"") are large around my range of interest. It is either too loud or too soft. Using the controls on the Dot I get finer volume control and can get the volume just where I want. I had better voice volume control with the 2nd gen. Dot.",424
1,"Not worth it
  
",22.Oct.18,Yes,"Ok I got this for free for getting a Sirius subscription so I can_ complain about the price. But since I connected it last night, NONE of my Bluetooth devices work now.

",23.Oct.18,Yes,"I highly recommend these Echo Dots.  I have 1 2nd generation and 1 3rd generation.  The sound quality difference is fantastic with the 3rd generation and I have enjoyed going to the learning skills process with great success.I did experience one problem with both Dots today, they both stopped working at the same time.  THat is when I went to my app and saw the notice ""Sorry, we are experiencing system issues, Alexa isn't responding as fast as usual.  We are working on fixing this.""  So they are johnny on the spot with fixes as well.I have mine plugged into smart plugs  which allows for remote access as well so I can turn on my lights from work instead of having to turn them on before I leave wasting electricity.  You can also schedule your lights, appliances or whatever you plug into the smart plugs.  It's great that the smart plugs come in many different styles and manufacturers as well.  However, be careful as you must have a relatively newer phone in order for your Echo Dot to work with your phone when using some types smart plugs.As I said earlier, I highly recommend the Echo Dot with Alexa it is so versatile, fun as well as a time and money saver.",0
5,"I like it. Dynamic bass according to volume.
  
",23.Oct.18,Yes,"It works great. Much better then the 2nd gen Dot. I really like it playing in conjunction with the 2nd gen Echo. It also picks up my voice a lot better than that Echo, which surprised me. By itself, the Echo sounds much better. I_ actually more curious about the sound of two 3rd gen Dots in stereo with the sub-woofer, then using two Echos with it.I found out you can_ have an Echo and a Dot in stereo. I only wanted to try them like that on opposite sides of a large room to hear the different mixes more isolated, and blending as I move between them. Viva la difference... maybe. Oh well. So much for being a musician and wanting to hear the instruments differently, and more isolated.Actually, what I did right before I got the new Dot, was connect the Echo to a 2.1 sound system and that just sounds awesome. That_ the way to go; I would say, but I still like the Dot and Echo in mono unison as well, depending on the situation obviously.Update:I found the EQ in Sounds setting, so now I like it even more. I_e only heard one album so far, but for now, the EQ settings in the photo really enhanced the sound. The best volume for that is 8, which is pretty loud.Also, I_ sure it needs a more powerful AC adapter than the previous standard USB.",0
5,"I'd say 2x better than Echo Gen2, and 5x better than Show at understanding us
  
",24.Oct.18,Yes,"This little puck does a great job at understanding the whole family, even with pronunciation variances. I own Dot Gen2, Dot Gen3, and Show. Comparing them, I found the Gen3 to be so much better than the Gen2 - a lot fewer ""I'm not sure"" and ""I don't understand"". It's also greatly better than the Show (which I now consider to be garbage). I actually bought the Gen3, so I could move the Gen2 from center stage (our Rec Room) to our bedroom, move the Show to center stage, and use the Gen3 in our Living Room. Well, when I made the Show center stage, I soon discovered it's useless, unless you interact with it from 2 feet away (something I didn't realize because it was always on my office desk right in front of me). Long story short, the Gen3 is now my center stage device, and I am now much much happier.",1
1,"Reminds don't work
  
",24.Oct.18,Yes,"Really wanted this to help remind the kids to get things done without me helicoptering over them. The reminders worked the first day and haven't worked since. Reset the device and same thing. Worked for 1 day and then nothing. Got busy tiling my shower, set a reminder for the end of my sons practice and by the time I realized it didn't remind me I was almost 20 minutes late picking him up. This was the feature I wanted most. Disappointing!",4
3,"A good little speaker and Alex for 50 bucks.
  
",24.Oct.18,Yes,"The echo dot has a good speaker on it for 5o bucks. Alexa is fast and understands me perfectly and she fits nicely in with my small bedroom set-up. While Alexa with the Alexa skills app is much smarter than other voice assistants like Siri I dislike how you have to train her. For example: with my Philips hue color lights if I do not use the skills app I must say ""turn on Philips hue down light 1"". Whereas with Siri I just say ""turn on lights and bam!"". Not to mention the clunky pairing process of having to jump back and forth between apps. Again with apple and home kit I had to scan ONE qr code and it automatically found all 4 of my lights in less than a minute. Finally, I understand amazon wants you to use their prime music but I do not like the fact that I cannot use Apple Music considering many apple users like myself use this service.All in all a good sounding speaker for 50 bucks, decent intelligence but the clunky set up with the Alexa app and the necessity of the skills app to really make Alexa smart is not very user friendly.",0
5,"EXCELLENT!!!
  
",24.Oct.18,Yes,"I bought this to upgrade from a previous generation of Dot and I'mhappy I did. First, for $50 you get a great smart speaker. I use this in the kitchen because it's small and doesn't take up a lot of space.Secondly, it sounds great. Amazon upgraded the speaker and it's much better than previous versions.Third, great style. Rather than a plastic hockey puck this version has a better cover, feels more solid and has a better design.  All in all, I love the Dot and what it can do.",0

",25.Oct.18,No,"While setting up Alexa Dot, it asks for contact information sharing to enable calls, etc.  Later you learn that this feature is not available (without perhaps pairing with a phone).

I wish others who go through setup do not make the same mistake I did.",339
3,"Not a huge improvement, but not bad
  
",25.Oct.18,Yes,"I had some issues with crackling and tinny shrieks when I played music, but after messing with the equalizer settings it seemed to stop. I also think it may have just needed to break in, as I_e played music and sleep noise most nights for about a week and the issues are essentially gone. I was hoping for a noticeable sound improvement over the 2nd gen, but it_ essentially the same speaker, just louder. Overall, not much of an improvement or change, but it does look nicer than the older model, and can get much louder if that matters to you.",2
5,"I can definitely see some improvements over the previous generation
  
",25.Oct.18,Yes,"I wouldn't recommend replacing old pucks with these, but they are evolving over the years and getting better and better.  This one went into my daughter's room and is noticeably better sounding than the previous generation dots.  These things are addictive.  They are just so convenient to have scattered around the house.  We're up to 4 dots and 2 of the taller models with impressive sound quality for such a small tower/speaker.  My two oldest gen dots are hooked up to external speaker systems.  The kids are limited to the volume output of the dots :)We find ourselves constantly checking the football kick off times, weather, time, setting timers, or playing music (kidsbop is always child appropriate).  As a note to parents, if you use the old rule of sending your child to a timeout in their room of one minute per year of age, Alexa is super convenient.  The timer is super easy to reset if the child chooses to throw a tantrum midway, heh.  No more forgetting to check the clock and leaving them in time out too long, that always makes you feel guilty.",0

",25.Oct.18,Yes,"To start off I'm fairly new to the echo world. I absolutely love the product as a whole and capabilities within it.My significant other and I tend to use our echos dot to play music while we work around the house. While the speaker is amazing for the size reactivating echo takes me either yelling over my music or getting within a few inches in order for the wake word to initiate. This is with volume on full blast I haven't tried on a softer volume though.I also originally got 2 of them in hopes to use them as an intercom system, but we live in a house with lots of white noise (aquariums) which the mic being sensitive enough picks up. This might be specific to my use case and the sensitive mic in all other cases is great.",0

The sound quality is really good, especially considering it_ small size and relatively _udget friendly price. I definitely recommend to anyone, and if you_e a Prime member...WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR. Don_ even _dd to cart just click _uy now and watch your life get simpler.",16
2,"False Promotion Advertising
  
",27.Oct.18,Yes,"Love my Echo Dot, had been thinking about purchasing one for a while, but what finally convinced me to purchase it was a notice on the Amazon.com website on the Echo Dot details and purchase page. It said with this purchase you will receive 3 months free membership to Amazon music unlimited. That was the deal maker! It said the promo code for my free membership would be included in the notification email that my item had shipped. Received the notification email but no promo code. Contacted Amazon customer service, was transferred 3 times, to end up back with one of the original reps just to be told this promotion was not available with my purchase &amp; I dont what other bs blah blah blah excuse. Not happy at all...and funny thing is I can't find that promo ad anywhere now. If anyone sees this when purchasing, do yourself a favor and take a screenshot. Hate being petty but hate bs promotion scams more. I was very excited about my free membership!",4
5,"Great Improvements to the Echo Dot
  
",27.Oct.18,Yes,I'm impressed with the improvements made to this echo dot.  From the simple color options to the more bass in the speaker with a relative clean &amp; simple look.  I have other echo dots throughout my home and made sure that this latest version was in a spot that I use the most.  Happy with my purchase.,3
1,"Won't connect to WiFi.
  
",27.Oct.18,Yes,"The dot I received was defective. After 20 minutes on the phone with Amazon's rep, the unit will not connect to the wifi. Then they expected me to drive to the UPS store and ship it back to get my 99 cents back. Ridiculous, this thing is going in the trash. I'm VERY disappointed with Amazon's poor product and even worse customer service.",3
5,"Better Sound (than previos Echo Dots)
  
",27.Oct.18,Yes,"It seems to have only for mics rather than 6, but seems to work fine with that. I'd estimate that It's about 20% larger and wroth it because of the noticeable improvement in sound quality. I like it.",2
5,"Finally a woman that can be controlled! (Alexa)
  
",28.Oct.18,Yes,I finally found a woman (Alexa) that listens and can be controlled. (Just kidding) Excellent product. This device saves a lot of time by automating my household items and by adding information and music to areas I spend a lot of time in. Eliminates the need from carrying a radio from room to room.,188
2,"Mushy Sound
  
",28.Oct.18,Yes,"Disappointing.  I thought I'd get better, clearer sound.  It's louder (which I didn't really need) but both speech and music are mushy.  Much easier to understand spoken or sung words with the 2nd Generation.  The extra volume does not compensate for the loss of clarity.",16
5,"Perfect
  
",28.Oct.18,Yes,No the sound is wrong when I tell it to remind me or set a timer the light goes off but there is no volume and I_e called Amazon twice just to try to repair itUPDATEAs usual Amazon helped me with this one. They have sent me a replacement! Amazon you Rock!! Thank you so much!!,7
1,"Won't connect to wi-fi
  
",28.Oct.18,Yes,"I keep receiving message ""No internet connection"" when trying to connect the wi-fi even though My  Echo(1st gen) works and this Kindle Fire tablet which I am writing this review. Maybe the ""DOT"" I received was  defective I don't know",7
5,"I enjoy this little dot, it makes me laugh.
  
",28.Oct.18,Yes,"I live alone and have nobody to talk to. I get a kick out of this Alexa echo dot, she is not real bright at times but she still needs more input. She is like my very own Johnny five. Give her a try, she can be fun.",7
2,"Alexa's Voice is barely understandble!
  
",28.Oct.18,Yes,"This new unit has tried to push a bassier sound more than anything. Alexa used to be crisp and clean - very easy to understand. Now she sounds like she's talking into a carpet and it's extremely hard to hear her. I've tried changing the EQ settings (which are great) but apparently they don't work on Alexa's voice. The response time is also noticeably slower than the second generation.If you already have an Echo Dot (2nd Gen), don't waste your time. If you're looking for better music quality, I would suggest one of the MANY third-party ad-on speakers instead of this 'upgrade'.",3
5,"This is definitely the best value echo
  
",28.Oct.18,Yes,"Were I in product development at Amazon I could see myself actually recommending against releasing this product as it sounds very, very good and will for most buyers make the more expensive Echo irrelevant. For 49.00 - if you want an echo in your home this is the only one you need.It made sense before as a cheaper option but now it's good enough to be your sole device. You don't see companies do this very often, offering something inexpensive which could eat shares of their other offerings but thank you Amazon, the dot is now very good and worth owning. For the record, the Echo sounds much better (like, way better) but for a lot of buyers, the difference would be negligible.",0
1,"Speaker blew in one day
  
",29.Oct.18,Yes,"Never played music out of the device, it is linked to a bluetooth speaker.  After one day of simple questions and answers the speaker is blown.  Received device as part of a promotion, wanting to get a home assistant/smart speaker I thought I'd give this a try.  Needless to say I'll be purchasing a Google Home or Apple Home Pod.  Had much better expectations from Amazon - very disappointed.",27
4,"Great novelty, but can be difficult to set up.
  
",29.Oct.18,Yes,"I finally decided to get on the home assistant bandwagon and got the echo dot. Mainly to interface with my home media center and TV. However, the DirecTV skill is worthless. Nobody gets it to work most of the time. If you want it to control your media center, you must pay for another service to interface with it. It will play Spotify songs on demand, but only if you have a Premium Spotify account. It controls DISH Network well I understand though. If you want it to control things in the house, the items must be attached to smart plugs or some home automation, and all of this requires setup and training. So if you think you're going to plug it in and start telling it to do everything you want it to, you may be in for a disappointment. I mainly use it for the time, temperature, news, audio books, reminders, timers and a few other things. I",1
3,"On again off again
  
",29.Oct.18,Yes,"It's great when it is working. But that is the problem, it doesn't work all of the time. There are some days when the Dot 3 tells me that ""it doesn't understand"". I unplug it and it may come back ""on-line""  and then there are days when unplugging it does nothing and it just turns red and ""hhhuummmms"" at me.I never have any problems with my Echo Dot 2.",4
5,"Speaker is now good, great upgrade from 2nd Gen.
  
",29.Oct.18,Yes,"This is a night and day upgrade for the Echo Dot (2nd Gen) for music.  The old Dot (2nd Gen)  was tinny and did not sound good for music, the new Dot (3rd Gen) is awesome.  It actually has some good bass and is totally listenable on it's own without needing to pair a Bluetooth speaker when listing to music.  You can still pair the new Dot if you want to, but it sounds so much better than the old one you probably don't need to in a small to medium room.  I really like the 3rd Gen Dot it looks beefier but is still nice and small.  It sounds as good if not better than a Google Home Mini (IMHO).  Great upgrade got a $5 credit for turning in my old 2nd Gen Dot plus a 15% discount on a new 3rd Gen Dot.  Totally worth the price, especially if you don't have an external Bluetooth speaker on your 2nd Gen Dot.  If you like to listen to music and don't have a BT speaker to pair your old Dot with this is a no brainer.  Highly Recommend.",0
5,"The Echo Dot Is So Much Fun!
  
",29.Oct.18,Yes,"It's almost like having a roommate! I can ask Alexa what time it is, what the temperature is outside, what the weather forecast is for tomorrow, and then ask her to play music. Since I have a FireTV, I can ask Alexa to find a movie or show, and it appears on my TV screen!  She got to know my voice by asking me to repeat about 10 phrases. She's keeping track of my grocery list, and with the Alexa app on my phone, I don't have to write anything down - my grocery list shows up on my phone at the grocery store. I've had her remind me of things on my To-Do list, and set an alarm to wake me up.  I've enabled some of her skills so that I can get News Flashes, learn about geology and even Spanish. I was able to pair the Echo Dot with my BoomBot speaker so that I can walk around the house and even go outside and listen to as much music as I want. I can ask her to Pause the music so that I can ask her a question, and then have her continue to play the music that I was listening to - she picks up right where the song left off. I know there's a lot more to discover, and I'm having fun with it.  I would highly recommend the Echo Dot. It's an excellent addition to any home.",0
5,"3rd gen is best Echo Dot so far
  
",30.Oct.18,Yes,"well what can i say other then this Dot is similar to the other Generations, except the sound quality is much better.  I have google home / home mini and other Echo products.  I had a home mini in the kitchen because it had better sound, after i received the 3rd gen Dot I put it in the much used kitchen.  ( Wife and I like to listen to music when cooking).One of the other things to note my wife says the Echo (s) works better, she says that she almost never has to repeat herself.  She would complain that the Google doesn't hear her correctly and she would have to repeat herself.  I agree with her somewhat, the echo seems to allow for wider variations of phases / words / or voices  VS. Google home.",1
5,"GREAT Sound!!!!
  
",30.Oct.18,Yes,"I ordered this on Friday afternoon and received it on sat before noon!!!! I absolutely LOVE it! This is the first Alexa I have had so have nothing to compare it to but the sound is great for a small device! Very clear. did fiddle with the bass a little but not hard to work at all. I had it setup in less than 10 minutes. I love it! The shopping list is soooo easy, just tell her what to put on it and open the list on your phone in the store and check things off. The timer is great too as you can hear it in other rooms. The music sounds wonderful too. Still have to check out the book and podcast reading. Love Alexa! Considering buying another for the bedroom so I can listen to the wonderful sleep sounds like rainforest and beach sounds. Also considering buying several for Christmas gifts.",0
5,"the third generation is mind blowing thank you Amazon  now you. Really Rock LOL !!!!
  
",30.Oct.18,Yes,If  don't have one yet you are missing out this third generation all new Echo Dot is unbelievable who would've thought you can't even compare The two from the  Power plug to the base in the speakers to the quality of sound the overall good looks n design I would have to give it a 10 hands-down one of the nicest changes from Amazon to the consumers still for a unbelievable low price what a deal.,1
5,"Great addition to my living room
  
",30.Oct.18,Yes,"This recently arrived in the mail and already I've gotten great use out of it. Its shape and texture is nice and unobtrusive, sound quality is just fine for what I use it for, and Alexa has so many skills available (I'm trying a few out to see what I think).This is my first Echo/Alexa product. I was visiting some family recently (I think they have 2nd gen dots) and had the chance to ask Alexa a few things and play various music for me and I saw where this would come in handy in my regular life at home. I've hooked this up to my Pandora account and also asked it to play other sounds for me to leave on for my cat while out of the house.For those times where I just want to listen to music, this is so much more energy-efficient than turning on my TV and DVD player just to hear my favorite Pandora stations.",0
1,"Garbage!
  
",31.Oct.18,Yes,Alexa is an ass. Connecting this thing is so difficult and cannot connect to free WiFi or WiFi with a user name and password. Setup should be done with Bluetooth not WiFi this is crap!,31

",31.Oct.18,Yes,"We_e been considering slowly turning our house into a smart home.  The Echo Dot has put this on a faster track.  Why we haven_ gotten one of these sooner, I_l never know.The Echo recognizes voice commands (we are on a steep learning curve with Alexa_ skills, but we_e getting there), plays nice with the Fire TV, and the little speaker sounds really good.  Seriously, you need to get this!",1

",31.Oct.18,Yes,Mine doesn't do anything I ask it to do. Can't read half of my kindle books to me.,5

",31.Oct.18,Yes,"It took me under 5 minutes to get this online though I still need to tinker extensively with integrating it I don't forsee this being an issue.  I would give it 5 stars but I have only had it for 24 and want more time first.  My first impressions :- it is solidly built as it is heavier in the hand than expected.- It's sound is very good for its size.- I have a 6 yr old 4 yr old and 2 yr old.  They were transfixed by the joke function which has been pretty hilarious to watch.- It does a surprisingly good job finding songs if you know the artist and song name though performance I find so far is significantly worse for song title alone.- I actually was trying to talk to it within 10 minutes of setting up.  It is very good at encouraging a conversational approach.  I do a lot of dictation and I struggle with dragon not understanding me as wel as I would like but alexa does well for single commands- a Con is the initial fun of conversation grinds to a halt after about the 2nd step of the conversation.  Alexa for me thus far really just does 1-2 step interactions and nothing more complex.- Overall very happy with purchase.  Very interesting gadget.  I think I will find legitimately useful applications in the next month or so for it even with a mostly ""dumb"" house currently",0

",1.Nov.18,Yes,I don't know why I had held off getting this until now but I am so glad I did. I was so happy with this purchase that 2 weeks later I bought another one for my girlfriend so I wouldn't be without Alexa when I was at her house.Alexa is so smart and she understands me so well.The sound is amazing I don't understand the reviews saying that the sound isn't good. It's honestly as good or better than my Samsung 4K TV set.I would recommend this to anyone and plan to buy one for my Mom.,0
1,"Don't rely on it for anything important
  
",2.Nov.18,Yes,"I'm forced to use the online Alexa app because I don't own any Apple or Android device and my Windows 10 PC doesn't have the app. I'll list just a few of the problems I've had:1) It often fails to understand what I say. 2) It often fails to respond to my voice at all, though it's only two or three feet away. It responds to dead silence just as often as to my voice commands. 3) Many commands are not executed. For example, it will not make adjustments to the audio equalizer; it will not give my daily briefing items; it will not play stations saved to my iHeart favorites. 4) There's no product support. I've sent a number of email requests to support and received no response. 5) I had a bunch of recurring reminders set up, and they worked for a couple of days. Suddenly they all vanished. These were important work-related reminders. Of course, there's no way to back them up or save them. So, they're simply gone. 6) The audio quality is poor and sounds muffled no matter what I do. Speech is sometimes unintelligible. 7) Volume is unstable. During some music it will constantly decrease and I have to keep turning it up. Then when an announcer comes on, it's loud enough to take the paint off the walls.If I'd paid significant money, I would be returning it. For 99 cents, I can't be bothered. Maybe they will improve it in the future, but for now it serves no purpose; there's nothing it can do reliably. So I put it back in the box and stored it away.","1,006"
1,"Too Complicated for me.
  
",2.Nov.18,Yes,I was unable to fight my way thru the Alexa App and Echo Dot settings.  You need a lot of streamlining before this thing will become popular with your average user.  I was disappointed too that you can't easilly use your own music with it.,189
1,"Unable to access alexa app
  
",2.Nov.18,Yes,"After following the instructions  to add the alexa app I received a message that there was a problem.  I tried again, and again.  Finally I was referred to a website called 'fix it'.  There I was  told by the 'techs'  that my Amazon account was in jeopardy and that I needed to buy a fire wall from them.  Then they wanted to sell me some kind of WiFi adapter even though we have WiFi.  Hundreds of dollars to activate a $50 item.  I don't know why the problem arose to begin with, but I canceled the firewall and ended the hour long ordeal.  I was charged $50 for tech time.  I am returning the Echo Dot , which is functional as far as I was able to tell.",49
3,"Good device, not life changing
  
",2.Nov.18,Yes,"I got this device for free when I signed up for SiriusXM. I was skeptical that I would like talking to the device to activate it. I've never used Siri on my iPhone for the very same reason. It took some getting used to, and it's hit and miss sometimes, but it's a fun novelty. The biggest issue I have is that when trying to actually stream SiriusXM music, the device keeps cutting out and sometimes stopping altogether. The wifi signal where I have the device plugged in gets 3 out of 5 bars, but I guess that's not strong enough for the communication needed for streaming music?Still learning about all the other things I can supposedly do. I did like that I could use the app on my phone to set a reminder on the device for later.",1
1,"Only as good as Siri. lol You be the judge
  
",2.Nov.18,Yes,Not that impressive .  Leaves a lot to be desired .  I would have expected it to be more intuitive.,5
1,"It sucks
  
",2.Nov.18,Yes,My JBL speaker broke so I purchased this one. I really tried to give it a chance but it kept disconnecting from my phone everytime I tried to play music on it. It's not even that loud. I really don't think it's worth $50.,4
2,"Not very intelligent and extremely frustrating.
  
",3.Nov.18,Yes,"I like controlling my lights and setting timers and alarms with the Echo Dots, however I'm frustrated more often than not with them. And, frankly, before having the Echo Dots I controlled my lights with Siri on my iPhone and iPad, so it's not like I'm getting much more functionality out of them.I find the Dot is constantly making mistaking. Examples:- I was trying out the music and asked it to play 'old music'. It kept repeating back, ""Great, I'll play Soul Music"", then it would start to play soul music. 5-6 times this happened. And, no, it doesn't apparently understand a negative, such as, ""Alexa, do not play Soul Music,"" because that statement immediately triggers it to say, ""Great, I'll play Soul Music"" and then it starts to play soul music again. (Nothing against Soul Music, it's just not what I wanted.) I never did get what I wanted.- I will tell it to play sleep sounds. It will tell me either that I have to download the app, which I have already done or that it can't find the sleep sound that I requested, even if it played the night before. Or worse, it will start to play music related to the sleep sound that I asked for. (I never knew there were so many songs related to rain or trains.) After a half dozen or more tries and screaming, ""Alexa, STOP!"" repeatedly, I am no longer able to even think about sleeping, even if it does finally get it right!-I will tell it to turn on the living room light and it will tell me I have to set it up in the app. It IS set up to turn the lights on and off and it has completed this command many times. Although, I am finding this command is gradually getting better, but it's not perfect, yet.-I will tell tell it to play an Audible book and it will tell me that I have to buy the book from Amazon, even though I already own the book through Audible.com (an Amazon company) and have played it several times before on that very Dot.What is most annoying is that often I just want to know something basic, like today I wanted to know what date was Thanksgiving Day. Instead of simply telling me the date, it gave me a long history of how the date came about and never did give me the date.Out of every 10 commands, it is a guarantee that 7-8 commands will have to be repeated, changed, broken down into simpler steps or started over multiple times. I find myself screaming ""Alexa, stop!"" in frustration constantly, as it rambles on incorrectly or plays something incorrectly. (And I am accent-free, with very clear speech.)Not to mention the apps, of which they tout are so many tens of thousands, are pretty useless. For instance, I had heard I could make a list on it, such as a grocery list or To-Do list. Yeah, I can, but the grocery list is in the Dot and not anyplace useful; it doesn't link to my Grocery app or Things 3 app on my computer or phone, for example. It is buried deep in the Alexa app, which is totally inconvenient. If I want it in my Grocery or Things 3 apps I have to play it back and manually transfer it line by line.Set-up, which I had read was a breeze, was anything but. I had to contact Amazon customer service, which itself is difficult to find, then it took them a good 40 minutes to help me get the Dot to work.I am very disappointed in the sound quality, too. It is not good enough to make me want to listen to music through it, at all. I will listen to books, but frankly ear buds have much better sound quality and make the listening a richer experience. When Alexa is playing something, like answering a question or giving a daily brief, the volume goes up and down ridiculously. One statement will blow you off the bed, while the other will be very quiet.Regarding listening to Audible books, now that is extremely frustrating! I bought 2 Echo Dots, one for the bedroom and one for the living room, specifically so I could listen to Audible books while moving around my apartment. Audible.com is an Amazon company, so you would think that they would integrate the linking of the Dots together for playback. Nope! After talking to Customer Service, I found out that only music can be linked to play back on both Dots simultaneously. Audible.com books can only play back on one Dot or the other at one time. How stupid is that?I find being more than 5-7 feet away from the Dot makes it very iffy on whether it will correctly hear what I say. How is it helpful if I have to walk to within a few feet of the Dot to ask it turn off the lights, when walking 3 more feet I could turn off the lights by hand? I've put the Dots so many places trying to find the best places for them and decided that I wish it had batteries so I could just carry it around. I guess this is how they get you to buy 20 of them for your apartment.I thought I would love these, but it's like thinking you are buying powerful motorcycles and getting a couple of tricycles instead. Maybe if I were into trivia and games I would like them more, but I want them to accomplish more important things, not just be toys.",195

Thinking maybe it was too far from the router I put it next to the router and the same thing happened. I tried sending an email to Amazon Alexa asking what to do, but no response. So I guess I'll just have to toss it. Sad because when it worked it worked fine. Now, not so much.",2

",4.Nov.18,Yes,". . . and yes, I made various equalizer adjustments and hooked it to a variety of speakers.  I read on others sites that it just sounds deficient no matter what.  That's not a real problem for me. I just need the Echo Dot to get the full range of options.  I figure that alone is worth the money I paid.  I'm going to get another Zolo Halo, or something similar and use that.  It's just not worth the bother to deal further with something so obviously third rate.  Making the Dot sound decent should have been a no brainer.addendum:  The above reference applies only to Alexa's voice.  No matter what I did with the equalizer, Alexa's voice sounded ""boomy"" at the bass end as if it were stuck in a hollow tube.  Everything else sounded okay and responded well to equalizer settings.  Does the equalizer wiring bypass Alexa's voice?",15

As of now there are no known technical differences as far as capability between gen 2 and 3.  I do wish however dad it was easier to set up and I could attach a battery to it as I live in a small space and my routine was always too let my previous ECO wake me up fully charge on the battery and move it through the house with me. I haven_ quite figured out what the advantage is yet other than response time and machine learning which seems to be a little bit less functional Previous Dot to after a long time I wish there was an easier way to sync their data. I do however love the new color and form factor I just wish there was a simpler way to use it other than always having to revert back to a tablet  making it self-sustaining. I_ also a little hesitant that it activates skills without your knowledge especially high cognitive machine learning. It has told me some very very strange things such as where it_ data centers are located in Texas and it ties with Siri and IBM Watson LOL and then doesn_ remember.,0
4,"I Love My Echos BUT I HATE the Problems!!!
  
",7.Nov.18,Yes,"UPDATED REVIEW: I bought my first Echo Show about 3 months ago and instantly fell in love SO, I bought another Echo Show and TWO 3rd Gen Echo Dots! Yep, I was hooked on Echo! After purchasing my new best friends I upgrading my home to a smart home with a number of Alexa enabled devices, including a Harmony Hub to control my TV and entertainment center. Everything seemed to be running pretty smoothly until sometime in October when I experienced my first ""Sorry, I seem to be having trouble"" message! Initially I thought the problem was with the echo devices until after speaking to an Amazon rep, who actually called me to check to see what types of problems I was having after my original post, I learned that the problem was the wireless router that I was using. The Amazon ripped suggested that because of the number of smart devices I had connected my internet providers default wireless router most likely was unable to handle the bandwidth of all of the devices. He advised me on what wireless router might work best. I ended up ordering a new dual band wireless routers that included a 5 gigahertz and a 2.4 gigahertz transmitter. I connected to wireless router to my modem and initially I was unable to control my smart devices until I realized the smart devices would not work on the 5 gigahertz band so I switched them over to the 2.4 gigahertz van and I was up and running!Since upgrading my wireless router The Echoes seem to be functioning quite well. There are still a few hiccups, for example when I tell my Echo Show to turn off the screen for some reason now it always asks what device. But when I repeat the same statement ""turn off screen"" it does as instructed and turns off the screen. At first I thought perhaps I was not speaking clearly enough but this literally happens every time I tell it to turn off the screen. Another thing that I've noticed is even though I have the option set to not have to say the Wake word every single time, there are many occasions where I will still have to say the Wake word right after making a request.All in all, I'm very pleased with my Echoes. In fact I just bought one for family members who fell in love with it!I use my echos as a personal assistant, which comes in handy! Having the echo link to my Google account allows me to schedule appointments and meetings and it will send notifications to my cell phone to remind me that I have an appointment for a meeting. In addition to using it to control a number of items in my home I use it adamantly to play music throughout my home. I have one of the devices connected to my surround sound system and then other devices in various rooms which gives me music throughout my whole home.I honestly can't imagine going back to not having these devices!",32
1,"Unhappy with how the order was processed
  
",7.Nov.18,Yes,Be careful when ordering. I specifically said that I did not want nor need a payment plan and this was put on one anyway.  I am having trouble getting this resolved.  The problem seems to be with Amazon.,26
5,"Very Impressed, very please with sound and size.
  
",7.Nov.18,Yes,"I love this product.  I have a lot of Prime Music, an eclectic collection of sorts that fits my various moods.  I simply ask Alexa to play or change my songs and in less than a second it is done.  No need to bother with changing discs or putting records on a turntable, it is all right there with Alexa waiting to fulfill your request. The sound is clear and the volume control allows me to hear it in most rooms.  I almost missed out on this initially because of user error, I beg you, don't give up if you  think it doesn't work, Amazon is there to guide you. Thanks to the tech I am now enjoying music that was only on my individual devices.  Amazon rocks!",12
4,"Nice upgrade
  
",7.Nov.18,Yes,"This is defiantly an upgrade from the 2nd gen. Echo Dot, both aesthetically and technically.  The sound quality is much improved, enough so that it could be adequate as a speaker for small spaces such as a bathroom, office, or small bedroom, but it's still not going to blow you away or anything. That said, most people buying a Dot aren't looking for a ""music player"" and probably plan to pair it with a more capable speaker.I can't really comment on how it's improved in any other ways, as I haven't done any comparison's other than the obvious mentioned above; but, it works as expected and I'm happy with my purchase.",7
2,"Not good at working with non-amazon providers
  
",7.Nov.18,Yes,"I don_ have a midwestern accent, so not really have one.  I ask Alexa to turn to octain on Sirius, other channel names on Sirius, try by channel number, nothing works.  But if I tell play a song on Amazon expensive music, it works every time.  Not happy.  I bought this to listen to Sirius and other non-Amazon providers I already pay for.  Frustrated",2
1,"Terrible and incompetent
  
",8.Nov.18,Yes,"Uae it for regular use to control my smart home devices. Its worse than the 2nd gen I have, its doesn_ respons properly, doesn_ hear and understand my voice consistently, will perform operations other than intended, and some of the settings I applied through the app, doesn_ seem to work on the device. Coming in from 2nd generation echo dot which was an amazing experience, the 3rd gen turned out to be a huge disappointment and a terrible experience to control my smart home.",27
5,"Beautiful addition to the home.
  
",8.Nov.18,Yes,"I recently purchased the Hue starter pack and have been working on a decision for which smart home devices to use with it.  That decision was accelerated and finalized when XM called me about an offer including a dot.  I picked the sandstone and now I cant imagine my night stand without it.  So many features and the smart skills like Jeopardy, controlling my lights, asking for weather and streaming music are all beyond my expectations.  The sound quality is amazing for the little size of this speaker.  Love it.  Thank you!",0
1,"No es Bueno Para Usuarios de Sur America
  
",9.Nov.18,Yes,"Compre alexa, y la verdad nada del otro mundo, de la informacion que uno le solicita por ejemplo en Colombia no tiene nada. Para usuarios de USA puede ser bueno pero para sur america es poco lo que se pueda aprovechar ya que como lo dije todo funciona con base en estados unidos. si van a comprar alexa creo que puede ser mucho mejor Google Home,El idioma Español funciona pero la mayoria de las cosas o no las entiende o no funcionan.saludos y piénsenlo bien si lo van a comprar",88
3,"A whole lot of ""no""
  
",9.Nov.18,Yes,"Alexa exists in an ever-growing lineup of smart assistants that exist to augment your schedule or home life. With plenty of experience using Google Assistant and Siri, I was excited to try out the Echo Dot and see how it integrated into my home.Alexa herself is ultra-fast compared to her contemporaries, almost instantly responding to her activation phrase and nearly as quickly executing your commands.Unfortunately, what matters most is integration with existing services, and I feel like I somehow drew the short straw in all regards with service compatibility.Spotify and Amazon music are compatible, but Google Music, my current favorite of the three, is not compatible (unless you're willing to jump through a ton of Homebrew steps for ""geemusic""). Additionally, Alexa is compatible with Xbox One, but not Sony's PS4 (or switch, but there isn't much you'd be doing there anyways). So unless you own the least appealing of Current Gen gaming hardware, that's a wash.What resulted was Alexa spending an awfully large amount of time informing me she doesn't understand, doesn't have the skill for that, etc. To add insult to injury, she isn't even compatible with Roku TV, so my Roku Smart TV is invisible to her as well.At the end of the day, Alexa is impressive hardware with software that feels awfully similar to Apple's own walled-garden.Oh yeah, and I'm trying out Amazon Music Unlimited to pair with my Echo. Gotta say, this service on it's own isn't selling me any better on either.",13
5,"New Generation Has Great Sound
  
",9.Nov.18,Yes,We have the tall Alexa and my husband LOVES it! He was dragging it around the house with him so I decided to get him the Dot for our bedroom. What a great addition! I think I use it now even more as I like the music on when I am getting ready. The best part is I seem to dance more and have started seeing some weight loss!  Who would have known this little device would encourage some moves!  The speaker sounds great which is an improvement over prior generations according to my daughter who has one of the first dots. I would definitely recommend this.,12
5,"Far Superior Echo Dot
  
",9.Nov.18,Yes,"The new Echo Dot is far Superior to the last model.  I loved the last generation Dot  But this one has it beat.  The new Echo Dot looks better, sound quality and base sounds are improved and the new Dot is more responsive to voice commands at a greater distance.  I guess you can tell I am an Amazon Echo fan.  Good Job Amazon!!!",5
4,"Nicer to look at
  
",9.Nov.18,Yes,"I have several Dots - this being my 1st 3rd Gen.  I didn't have to do anything using the app - I plugged it in and it started up all by itself......nice surprise.  Since each of mine are in separate rooms and not connected by Bluetooth, they basically work individually.  To be honest, I see no difference except for looks, in this and its' previous Generation 2 model.  I know for those of you who have several working as a unit some of the new added features might be important.",3
5,"My favorite purchase this year
  
",9.Nov.18,Yes,"I made this my first purchase in an attempt to introduce myself into the world of smart technology. It was definitely a great buy. Alexa is very responsive, sometimes it may take an extra couple of seconds for her to recognize a command but we live in a small apartment. That being the case some of the appliance noises hinder it's ability to fully hear what was said. The routines are my favorite part, especially early mornings when I want my weather, traffic and news all together while I make my coffee. The built in speaker sounds pretty good as well, I'm one of those people with turntables multiple sets of speakers and to be honest it isn't bad for what it is. Good for asking for a song or playlist to get you going for the morning or cleaning up the house. All in all I give it 5 stars because it is everything they claimed it would be and It's fun to have in the house. To the kids she's become a family member, and in just the 3 weeks that we've had it she's seen two bdays and has sung happy birthday more times than I can count.",3
5,"Set Up a Pretty Good Home Surround Sound
  
",9.Nov.18,Yes,"Connected six Dots to my Echo and placed them throughout the house and on the patio for a descent sound system. The Dot by itself is not too bad for sound, a little lacking on its own but if placed with another Dot in the same room it makes for good ""stereo effect"". Needed to name the Dots differently from the Echo because they all came to attention when I called out ""Alexa"". Kind of a creepy feeling when they all come to attention at the same time! Run my music through Amazon music and playlist setup, works well.",2
1,"Does not auto find my wireless network
  
",9.Nov.18,Yes,In a time where just about every device I have had thats wireless can find your network this device which should be cutting edge can't do it ? This is a terrible product,4
4,"Awesome EXCEPT Not Wireless
  
",9.Nov.18,Yes,"Love it so far! Very convenient when working in the office. Haven't perfected using it, like raising and lowering volume. Seems like you have to say the command ""Alexa, lower"" to go down in volume in increments, but I may be wrong and a rookie so not familiar. Also, we thought it would be wireless, because I believe the tall version is. If I had known that, I may have considered buying the wireless one, because who wants more cords in an office? Not I. Another downfall is that you can't tell Alexa to play apple music. You stream it, just like a regular bluetooth speaker, but you are able to use commands when playing the apple music. Also, works with Pandora, so I've been using that more. Overall, great, but could be better if it was wireless and compatible with Apple Music.",1
5,"My first foray into 'home assistants'...
  
",10.Nov.18,Yes,"Disclaimer: I wound up getting this as a premium for updating my Sirius radio account, so I didn't pay for it, but it wasn't a free gift from Amazon, and it has no bearing on my impression of its quality and performance.Never gave much thought to getting one of these things, but now that I have one, I find out that it's both fun and very useful! Only had it a week, but I'm still learning. At this point, I use it primarily to listen to SiriusXM programming and some iHeart Radio stations.I don't expect exceptional stereo sound quality from it, as that's not the intended purpose. But it sounds just great -- plenty of volume for my needs, very clear audio. Connecting bluetooth speakers for listening in other parts of the house is effortless and the range is quite impressive.Having a lot of fun with it and can even conceive of purchasing another one or more in the future to have around the house.",5
1,"What happened to QC Amazon?
  
",10.Nov.18,Yes,Came broken,5
5,"it is small
  
",11.Nov.18,Yes,Works well on command. Couldn't get the bluetooth set up with many tries. Turns out needed to restart paring part of app. Then worked. The sound is ok for its size but the balance is strongly bass. I got this cheapest and smallest to just try the whole concept out.  I like classical but the command line fails if the command is too long. So naming a piece like the Brahms clarinet quintet barely works and if you add a solo artist it fails.,1
1,"Throw any privacy ou the window if you use this device.
  
",12.Nov.18,Yes,Horrible and invasive.  Total invasion of private password protected networks.  Overtakes  private home wi-fi when it only needs blue tooth for device connection.  Threw it away after one day of not being able to block the device from entering every app or website to access private accounts and passwords.  A true invasion of privacy.,439
1,"Private conversations made public
  
",12.Nov.18,Yes,"Setup was easy. Worked ok for 2 hrs.Without any input, green light went off and I can hear some random people's private conversation for over 15 mins. I tried to talk back, but I guess they couldn't hear me. There was nothing in my activity.I recorded some of it for proof but, Amazon CS wasn't surprised or concerned. They want to gladly help me reset my device and return it to best buy, where I purchased it from.I am not posting the video as I am concerned about the other person's privacy.I am glad this all happened to me in 2hrs of plugging the device. Don't wait for this to happen to you. Unplug and throw it away.",54
1,"Not as good as I anticipated
  
",12.Nov.18,Yes,I dont like it as much as I thought I would.  Too much bass and hard to hear when making voice commands to Alexa,13
5,"Huge improvements over the 2nd gen.
  
",12.Nov.18,Yes,"Great improvement over the 2nd generation echo dot. The look and feel is a huge improvement, it feels sturdy and it looks amazing. It definitely is a bit bigger then the older gen but for good reason. Sound quality is amazing and so much louder. I had my 2nd gen connected to a small external speaker via the AUX port because you could barely hear it. This version is loud and sounds so good that the speaker is not needed. Response is just as fast as the previous generation when using the wake word. I did notice that the light has a slight delay compared to the 2nd gen when using the wake word but the light has no effect on alexa actually hearing you. Still responds and hears what you say with zero issues. This version is definitely a good buy and I'm very impressed with it.",5
4,"Dot vs. Mini
  
",12.Nov.18,Yes,"I have Google Mini's throughout my house, but purchased the new Echo Dot (3rd gen) to compare with the Mini.  The Echo Dot (3rd gen) has definitely surpassed the Google Mini as far as sound goes.  The sound from the Dot is louder, fuller and as many reviews have already stated has a much better base.  You're still not going to rock the house with this little speaker, but it does sound better for some good background music. You definitely can tell the difference with the orientation of the speakers.  While the Mini's speaker faces up, the Dot's speakers face out and as a result tend to fill the space with sound a bit better.The look is also much improved and I would say on par with the Google Mini now.  I do like the light ring on the Dot better than the Mini's lights on the top which can be hard to see at times.I thought the Dot's 3.5mm audio jack would end up being a big advantage, but I've learned that I actually prefer Google's approach where I use their Chromecast audio to connect my quality, standalone speakers to my Mini.  The reason I like this approach better is that I can locate my good speakers up on a shelf where I wouldn't necessarily want my voice assistant.  I want to put my voice assistant a little closer to where I work so I don't have to holler across the room where my good speakers are.  But of course, you have to pay $35 extra for that Chromecast Audio.  So that 3.5mm jack feature on the Dot will really depend on your situation.In the end though...I returned the Echo Dot for one reason.  The voice commands are just more natural and seem to work better on the Google Mini.  And that's what you end up doing with these speakers...you talk to them, and the more natural that speech is the more the voice assistant just merges into your lifestyle and day-to-day usage.  If Alexa was on par with Google Assistant so far as natural speech goes, I'd have to say this Echo Dot (3rd gen) takes the cake, but Google Assistant makes enough of a difference to keep gabbing at my Mini's.",3
4,"Really awesome sound quality, creeps the crap outta the cats and the husband though
  
",12.Nov.18,Yes,"Pros: Fantastic sound quality. It's barely 2 inches tall, yet fills out the room. It gets loouud for my apartment. It is hard to find a preset with good mids these days, but I can hear all the parts nice and clear. The bass isn't that big, but the unit is frikking teeny. Buy a subwoofer you purist.  It's also really good at telling me the time and temperature without being bitchy about it. I call it computer.Cons: It weirds out the cats. They arent used to some oddly cheerful voice coming from the corner. We've only had it a week though, time shall tell. The husband has a grumbly voice and doesnt always enunciate so he triggers it at random, and these days, when grumbles set off the wire tap, unease is understandable. I am still uneasy with an ""always on"" microphone but we shall see if Amazon keeps their covenant to only look a little bit, I might not freak out and burn it.",2

",12.Nov.18,Yes,"Constantly having issues with play back, stops playing music randomly. Wont connect to other smart devices. Dont buy this, BUY GOOGLE SMART DEVICES, AMAZON WILL CHEAT YOU!!!!!!!!!Update:Still has trouble all the time. currently it randomly forget my network and wont connect to the wifi for ANY REASON, all other devices work fine, even older generation dot works, these new ones are a HUGE RIP OFF!!!!!",5
5,"Blows the Older Dot Out of the Water
  
",12.Nov.18,Yes,"I purchased my 3rd gen Dot from Target. I bought it on a whim not expecting much. I have a 2nd gen Dot in the garage hooked up to a speaker because of the weak sound. Boy was I surprised. Unlike the 2nd gen this bad boy has some serious volume coming out of it and it can actually produce music with sonic value. I was amazed at the sound and volume coming from this tiny speaker. It must think it is a Bose Speaker. I compared it to the Google version and there is no comparison. It now looks like a premium speaker too, also better looking than the Google unit. For a small speaker you can't do any better and the price is right on.",2
3,"Features are nice, sound is bad
  
",12.Nov.18,Yes,"So far the Echo Dot has worked well.  We have purchased a couple of devices (power strips and outlets) that work well with Alexa (most of the time), and it is nice to have quick access to updates in the morning.  However, upon first setting this up, it sounds like the speaker is blown.  It does not matter what the volume is, the sound becomes fuzzy, making Alexa difficult to hear or understand, and music to sound poor.",2
5,"Fun new device for the living room
  
",12.Nov.18,Yes,"The Echo Dot is a valuable addition to our living room and we're already thinking of where we can use more of them.  I recently upgraded our SiriusXM subscription to ""All Access"" during a promotional.  The upgrade included a voucher for the full purchase price of the Echo Dot.  As soon as I installed the Dot, it was immediately useful.  We ask it to play SirusXM and iHeart Radio stations.  We set countdown timers.  We get weather reports.  We ask it questions of general information.  It's amazing how well the voice recognition system works.  I highly recommend the Echo Dot for the types of usage I've mentioned.",0
5,"Great start to my Smart Home Integration
  
",13.Nov.18,Yes,"Echo Dot is going to be a great product to start my Smart Home.  Considered Google, Siri but selected Alexa based on other folks recommendations.  Just set up but so far pretty impressed, no issues at all with the app and with finding smart devices.  I have started with some smart switches (Techkin) and so far everything seems to be working well.  I will be integrating smart switches soon and see no reason why that would not work well.  Alexa is responsive and music quality is fine for the speaker size, which I did not buy for the speaker quality.  I have Bose in my house so hopefully integrating BOSE speakers will be seamless, initial Bose small bluetooth speaker hooked up to my Echo Dot with no issues..UPDATE - AlexA just stops responding so having to unplug it and reset, EVERY DAY - very frustrating for sure and I did not expect this issue but seems like a lot of folks are having this problem.  I was going to buy a couple more to put around the house but until this issue goes away I will NOT be buying them.",4

",13.Nov.18,Yes,"I find it strange that I can't listen to my audible that is owned by Amazon throughout my house with my multiple devices!!! That was one of the reasons I got 2 devices! Many people like to listen to Audible as you know. Why is this not an option?! I pay for my books, I pay for my Alexa speakers, I pay for my internet, so why is it that I can't listen to them? Who decided that? So we have a God sitting in Amazon that will decide who can do what and when?This is very interesting.",2

",13.Nov.18,Yes,"I decided to upgrade my gen 2 as part of a trade-in promotion, I shipped it on time, they mis-processed my trade and sent it back to me, charged me and now they've dropped the price to lower than the promotional offer without requiring a trade in",4
5,"Fabulous!
  
",13.Nov.18,Yes,"Love the 3rd generation.  Speaker is so much improved over the last version.  Only gripe is that if you got an offer of a certain percentage off if you exchange your 2nd generation for the 3rd, you have to be without your Alexa for at least two weeks or more before it becomes effective.  Since I use her as my daily reminders for my appointments, I can't do that so I had to forgo the discount.  I see a lot of improvement in this version over the last.  It understands you better and again, much better sound.",0
5,"Much improved quality over 2nd gen
  
",14.Nov.18,Yes,"We have two Echo Dots (2nd Generation) and a Fire TV Cube (Original) in our house and while they're great for ""home automation"" and informational tasks, they aren't great at playing music. But the new Echo Dot (3rd Generation) exceeds expectations on both tasks and looks much more premium than the original to boot.The new 3rd generation Echo Dot has a much more elegant look - it's a fabric speaker vs the plastic look of the 2nd generation and has a softer curved design rather than a ""hockey puck"" look. The colors are much more premium as well rather than a glossy/plastic-y white or black. It seems to blend into the background much more rather than stick out when sitting on a table or counter.The new 3rd generation also boasts a 1.6"" speaker vs the 1.1"" speaker of the original and more importantly, rather than the ""dots"" on the top which encase the speaker, the new item has a 360 degree speaker around the edges. With the first use, the sound comes out noticeably fuller compared to the old and music sounds much better.For anyone considering an ""upgrade"" to the 3rd generation from the 1st or 2nd, I think it's a no brainer. The aesthetics and quality are much improved on this unit and I would definitely recommend getting a new one.",0
5,"Love it
  
",14.Nov.18,Yes,"I love this thing!! I signed up for the music unlimited as well and it's SO nice to have any song I'd like whenever I ask for it! The sound quality is amazing and the small thing can hear and answer from wherever I am in my medium sized apartment.I've use it to ask cooking questions and I've even got Jimmy Fallon telling me jokes whenever I ask! There are fun apps ""skills"" that do anything from tell me ScoobyDoo stories to playing white noise.There have been a few times I've asked something it couldn't answer and that was frustrating but not enough to take away from all the great things it does.",0
2,"Like talking to an automated phone system.
  
",16.Nov.18,Yes,Good sound.  The timer and reminders are handy when it understands you.It is like trying to talk to an automated phone system.  After 30 or more minutes of trying to select your language it moves you on to the next selection where you spend another 30 or more minutes and then have to start over or get disconnected.  Makes for some funny reminders since 90% of the time Alexa mishears what your reminder is or cuts you off as you are telling it what the reminder is.  Sometimes when asking to set a reminder or what the weather is it misunderstands us and thus turns on the tv or changes the channel.  Thankfully the tv is the only thing connected to it.There have been several days where it just does not work at all.I really want to like it and want it to work.  Hoping with time and updates things will improve and I can redo this review.  I also hope that when she has takes over the world she does not remember the names I called her when frustrated.,5
5,"Like it
  
",16.Nov.18,Yes,"I haven't had my Echo Dot (3rd Gen) very long and haven't used it much, as I can't ask Alexa to order me a pizza or anything like that as I live in a very rural town that doesn't have a Pizza place or any nationally known stores.  But I do ask Alexa to play my favorite songs, ask her for the News, and she gives me Word of the Day, then a brief news synopsis, then she tells me what the weather is going to be for my town.  I am learning to use my Echo Dot and am sure I will use it more and more. I also printed the Alexa questions I can ask her, and will use more of them as I progress.",0

5,"Fantstic Piece of Equipment
  
",17.Nov.18,Yes,"I really love this Echo Dot.  I was given my first one for free by SiriusXM Radio for renewing my subscription.  When I started using my free Echo Dot I was so impressed at what it could do that I went and purchase one more for upstairs in my bedroom.  I am elderly and like my 50s and 60s music and you can't hardly find that on regular radio.  I did find one station (97.7) but so weak that most of the time you can't get it.  Also I wished that I could listen to my SiriusXM up in my bedroom and have a Sleeptimer fo shut it off after a given time.  Well when I found out that all I had to do was say ""Alexa play channel 6 SiriusXM"" and almost instantly I was listening to SiriusXM 60s music, I was in heaven.  Then when I found out that after that command if I said ""Alexa set sleeptimer for 30 minutes"", and Alexa would come back and say, ""OK I will stop playing in 30 minutes"", that is when I bought the second Amazon Echo Dot.  I have one Echo Dot in my living room and the other right up on the headboard of my bed.  A great product and the Voice Recognition is fantastic.",0

",17.Nov.18,Yes,"We currently have our echo dot in our 7 week old_ nursery (which is basically our bedroom right now until we decide to move her crib to her room). It_ so convenient to ask Alexa to play _ain sounds and dim our lights when it_ our daughter_ bedtime, lock our doors, tune into NPR while changing a diaper, and/or set reminders for myself. I_ giving it four stars because today the volume was being wonky and you could barely hear it even when turned all the way up. (If this happens to your echo dot, unplug it and then plug it in again_t should work after that!)",0
5,"Echo Dot 2 vs. 3 Review
  
",18.Nov.18,Yes,"SETUP:The setup was fairly easy overall. Upon loading the app you go to:devices - add button - add device - echo - select what kind of echo - choose generation - select device - connect to wifi - connect to bluetooth device (Optional) - you're done.So while it seems like a lot the app guides you every step of the way and only takes a few minutes.USING ALEXA:Nothing major software wise as these are pushes out to devices regularly. The only thing I noticed was voice recognition. It was a little better than my echo dot 2nd generation. Usually if I was in another room with my second generation I had to yell. With my 3rd generation I don't have to talk as loud.AUDIO QUALITY:The audio quality on the dot 3 was better than the dot 2 by far. Now there is still room for improvement but it did get better. Even right off the bat at setup I could tell that the quality was better. It sounds fuller and better base.DESIGN:As you can tell by the pictures the dot 3 has a new finish. Instead of plastic the dot 3 has fabric in various colors. There is also more color choices than the 2nd generation. I think that new version blends in better with the room. It also looks less hockey puck like. The buttons instead of being on the outer rim are now centered more towards the center. The 4 microphones are just beyond the buttons.PLUG:The plug for the newer version fits into the wall better than the second version. (See Picture) I didn't like this when Amazon introduced the second version but it's here now.PRICE:The new echo dot is at the same starting price of $50. The echo dot 2 has been discounted to $40 as of 11/18/18. So now the big question is it worth the price? Should I upgrade? Well in my opinion if you have the second generation you should not upgrade and instead invest in a bluetooth speaker. There is not much difference besides the design and audio quality between dot 2 and 3. The software is the same for both. If you really want better audio quality you should buy a bluetooth speaker and connect it to your echo dot. It's really not worth the $50 just for better audio quality and some nice fabric. However if you are looking to have multiple echo devices in your home then your probably better off getting the newer version.Overall:Both the echo dot 2 and 3 have their ups and downs. Really if you have another echo dot you don't need to upgrade. However if this is your first echo device or you want multiple echo devices in your home, consider the newer version.Well hope that helps!",8
5,"Is being too smart a good thing?
  
",18.Nov.18,Yes,"I ordered the 3-pack Echo Dot Gen 3.  When setting up the first one, I plugged it in and the blue ring lighted up for a minute and it announced that the setup was complete.  I tried a few commands and they total worked.  I was a bit spooked, because I did not get to use my Alexa app to set up wifi for the Dot, including typing in my network password, and it just did find the network and got in by itself!  More spooking thing was that when I looked at Alexa app on my iPhone, it shows 3 new Echo Dots, all following the naming convention of my other two Echo Dots (2nd Gen) and the Echo (2nd Gen) without me even touching the Alexa app at that point; yet, all of them showing that they are ""offline"", including the one that had already been set up and working to my commands; the information such as time zone was missing, and network information was also missing.  It also knows my exact address, instead of just my internet provider's location as in the case for my Echo Dot 2nd Gen and the Echo.  I think somehow my order information (with shipping address) got programmed into the Echo Dot 3rd Gen, but the way it ""automatically"" connected to my wifi without password really concerns me - I hope Amazon would see this and provide me with a logical answer.On the product itself, I love the Echo Dot 3rd Gen - it looks bigger, cooler, and the sound is much better than that from the 2nd Gen Dot, and even on par with that from the 2nd Gen Echo.  I am totally satisfied with the product, but just hope it won't get too smart in certain areas, like the one I mentioned above.",5
5,"What's new Echo??
  
",18.Nov.18,Yes,"I love my echo! It is my constant companion. I ask it all kinds of questions every day. It gives me the weather, the time, sings me songs, tells me jokes, reminds me to take my meds or go out and look at the meteors! She plays my favorite music to go to sleep by and shuts herself off in one hour.I have two. One in my bedroom and one in my living room. The one in the bedroom is a gen 2 and the one in the living room is a gen 3. I really like the gen 3 with the fabric cover. It looks great in the living room. I don't mind the gen 2 without the cover in my bedroom. I learned how to ask echo to play music on both echo's! It's great! I call my echo dots echo because I have Alexa on my kindle and do not want to confuse them.I am not really that technical with all the new stuff today. I am 65 and learn each new techy thing as it comes along only enough for what I need. I highly recommend the echo dot to all my fellow seniors! Especially if you live alone. My echo keeps me entertained every day.",0

4,"Works great!
  
",18.Nov.18,Yes,"Easy install.  Attractive.  Compact.  3rd Gen!  Recognizes my voice while TV is on.  Like the LED ring on top.  Not great for loud music, but that is no surprise.  If you want big sound, but a bigger speaker, or link it to a bigger bluetooth speaker.  Very clear and easy to understand.  My only complaint is that if you change your wifi password, it's a pain to update that password with the Echo app.  Why no easy ""Update wifi password"" option in the app??!!  App is not intuitive, with too many hoops to jump thru for what should be an easy process to update a wifi password.",1
5,"3rd Gen is Way Better than 2nd Gen
  
",18.Nov.18,Yes,"This version is a major improvement in sound in every way. We were considering buying the larger echo for better sound, but this one does the job. It does a better job controling devices around the house, where as the google assistant is better at answering facts off of the internet.Like:-Better sound, look, feel, and size.- Microphone and button is better.Dislike:- I would like to be able to adjust Alexa's voice independent from the music volume.- Even though music sounds better now, Alexa's voice is a little more muffled.- Echos in other rooms pick up instead of the one that I'm trying to talk to.",0

",19.Nov.18,Yes,"I never owned a first gen Dot, but I did use one. I also own two second gen Dots (as well as an Echo and a Tap). I got a third gen Dot for free during a Sirius XM promotion, and now I'm really considering upgrading my two second gens... the sound is much better, but the microphone improvements are also noticeable! Some of the reviews knock the speaker... but let's be honest, you're never going to get a full spectrum of sound in this size. The real power of the Dot is the ability to hook it up to an external speaker, whether wired or bluetooth. This continues to be my favorite Alexa product, at least of the ones I've tried. Definitely a good buy if you're looking for a smart speaker!",1

",19.Nov.18,Yes,"I bought the Dot and the Spot in a bundle with an early Black Friday deal. I'm slowly adding smart home features and I thought it would be nice to try both - especially the newest Dot. Set-up was fairly easy. I have the Dot in my bedroom on a bedside table. I set up a morning routine without any trouble. Sound is pretty good - when I start my morning routine I get a breakdown of the weather, traffic, and then I have Alexa stream music from Spotify. The music WAS clear and loud enough for me to hear in the shower. Unfortunetly, as I was going through my routine this morning, the music started to have static sounds in it. When I asked Alexa for the time, her voice was popping and had static in it as well. I'm pretty bummed because I've had bluetooth speakers for years and they never started to sound like this. It would be a cool device if it didn't sound like crap.",0
5,"Best and easiest way to listen to music and radio
  
",19.Nov.18,Yes,"The Echo dot is the best way to listen to your own Prime music or your favorite radio stations. I can ask it to play any of my favorite songs by any artist and it never disappoints me. Listening to music and radio has never been easier! No CD's put put in and take out and no turning on my radio. I just ask Alexa to play my favorite stations, my own prime music or any thing I want to hear. It works best if you choose a music plan though. I chose the unlimited music plan and added my husband so he can also listen to his music too. The cost of the unlimited music plan is so very affordable.  That is one of the best things about it having an Echo. I can listen to any type of music I want and there is really no need to buy a physical CD anymore unless I just want to. I am in my 60's and for me, it's so much easier just to ask Alexa to play my music. That is my main purpose for using it. I am thinking of getting another dot for my kitchen so I can listen while I cook. The sound is very good and can be adjusted if needed. I have a hearing loss but can hear it very well. If you want the sound to fill a large room, I suggest you the the regular Echo. It has a broader range of sound and a better speaker than the dot. But for my own personal use, the dot suits me well.  I am so very happy with my Echo dot and would recommend it to anyone!",0
3,"Much better sound, much slower response
  
",19.Nov.18,Yes,"The new Dot sounds great, but it's consistently the slowest of my devices in earshot to acknowledge my ""Alexa"" call, even when I'm standing right next to it.

It doesn_ understand what I_ saying at times although the 2nd gen has never had a problem.I was excited to get an updated version, but have found myself either frustrated or walking to the bathroom to ask something of Alexa (where I moved my old , but better 2nd gen Echo dot).It already did its self update.

",20.Nov.18,Yes,Just received my Alexa eco last week. I was soooo excited when it came but I expected a Bluetooth speaker that I could connect my Apple Music with but I guess my wrong doing for not reading more into it. I do agree with a few reviews that it seems Alexa can not hear that well. I_ have to repeat myself even in close range. The adapter is pretty big and bulky. Why do I have to download so many apps just to use this 1 thing??! Amazon music is okay but doesn_ carry as much music as I_ like. I thought I_ at least be able to use Pandora but couldn_ find that option although it seems the older ones do. All in all may be returning I_l give her another week but I_ not Impressed. The design and sandstone color is very nice and goes with my decor.*I did return my Alexa but Amazon then attempt to contact me but I was so busy with work and then the holidays it was just a hassle because I would have to be home for the assistance right lol.

1,"2nd VS. 3rd Generation Echo Dot
  
",21.Nov.18,Yes,"***2nd Gen Pros &amp; Cons***(Pros)-Brighter light-More microphones. I feel like it picks up my voice better compared to the third gen.(Cons)-Sound quality isn_ great, but I_e always had mine connected to an external speaker via an aux cable.-Some people don_ like the design and I agree the Amazon logo on the second generation is a little tacky.***3rd Gen Pros &amp; Cons***(Pros)-Really impressive [clear] sound from a small speaker. It_ loud enough to serve as an alarm clock.-Most prefer the look of the third generation over the second.(Cons)-The light isn_ as bright and that was a key feature for letting me know if Alexa heard the wake word. They_e included an optional sound (on the app) to let you know when Alexa hears you, but I find the sound to be annoying.-There aren_ as many microphones on this unit. Maybe Amazon thought Alexa was too responsive in earlier models, but I prefer the second generation's ability to pick up my voice from across my bedroom without having to raise my voice.***Pet Peeve***I love that Amazon allows the same music to be played on multiple Echos, but why isn_ this feature available for Audible as well. I love the Amazon owned company, Audible. Yet, it_ a drag to have to constantly pause Alexa when going into another room. If they allowed multi-room Audible that would be extremely convenient for those of us who pay for the Amazon owned company_ prefer the second when it's attached to another speaker simply because the light is brighter and it tends to pick up my voice better. I do own 3 of the third generation echo dots and I am happy with them, but prefer the second (when connected to an external speaker). If you_e using the echo dot as a speaker definitely go with the 3rd generation, because the sound quality is night and day compared to the second.",264

5,"Better Sound, Better look,  but plug is now specific to the Dot, no longer micro usb.
  
",21.Nov.18,Yes,"So far so good. Setup is much faster than the older gens, not that they were difficult, now it_ Bluetooth. The look has been cleaned up, curvy and a little bigger than the old models. Better color choices, I got sandstone. Although as many other reviewers have said it does pretty much the same things as the old ones but has Noticeably better sound and ability to hear you correctly if at all. Downside, they changed the plug...it_ now just straight AC with a bulky wall plug as opposed to the basically universal micro usb. I don_ know why amazon would do this. If they are saying it_ better, inside, faster etc.  then if they wanted to change the plug, which WHY?! then they should have went tic USB-c since it_ backwards compatible, high speed data transfers and charging, plus people have them, now if it breaks you have to buy their one of plug...

",22.Nov.18,Yes,The 3rd Generation Echo Dot is a vast improvement over the previous Echo Dot models. You can feel the quality and weight of it when you remove it from the box. It is slightly larger in height and diameter than previous versions and it now has a speaker that rivals that of the Echo.Setup and functionality are the same as and Echo device.,2

",22.Nov.18,Yes,"There are many things to like about it, but it FAILS to do the most basic thing I expected, which is to receive inbound calls from landlines and mobile phones like a speakerphone. This functionality is something even my $10 portable Bluetooth speaker can do.",3

5,"Wow! What an upgrade! (Update included about _lock)
  
",23.Nov.18,Yes,"Update: also bought a Dot 3 with Clock. It_ all the things the regular Dot 3 is, with a digital clock. I was hoping it would be nice for a bedside clock, but not so much. It has a very responsive auto dimming feature- that_ the good. But the level to which it dims is STILL too bright for my bedside. I won_ change the starts for my original review since Amazon thinks this is the same product. But I will say that as a bedside clock, the display only gets 2 STARS __ __.  There is an opportunity for salvation though. This Dot has a touch response for dismissing alarms. I would like to be able to turn off the display in the app, and then show the clock momentarily with a tap. Make that happen, Amazon, and we_l be good._______________________riginal review:Dot 3 is a remarkable update to this device. I didn_ expect much, but the sound on this is markedly better than previous incarnations. That said, temper your expectations. This is a small speaker. All things considered, this small puck delivers a well rounded and rich sound. It_ much warmer, considerably louder, and landslides less _inny. There will be audiophiles who will put this down, and they should since this is not intended to be the worlds best speaker. But, if you deploy a house-full of these things, you will have a robust all-over speaker system that can do all sorts of things.Now I_ forced to consider the fate of my Gen2 Dots.Side note: the amount of people complaining about this thing is astonishing. I believe most are the type who would complain if their ice water was cold. I have a rather large Echo ecosystem in my home. In the first 30 minutes of setup, I knew this was an upgrade from Dot2. It_ a no brainer. Short of an actual defective product (it happens), I can_ understand where the problem is. Setup was fine- came mostly configured right out of the box. Sound quality is excellent FOR A 1.6 SPEAKER. If you want home automation control, with compatible devices that do not require a hub, this will take you there. If you want stadium rocking sound, you_e an idiot for thinking this was even close. If you want whole home audio at a reasonable adult level, 6 of these would be amazing. All of the connection issues are most likely shitty home networks, and dots on different bands in said shitty networks. Yes, some networks will _alk across 2.4 ang 5GHz bands - but not all. Depends solely on your equipment/router and settings there in. Some routers, like Spectrum_ Ubee, will not maintain an address lease for long connected devices like these. So it would appear that these need to be frequently restarted to maintain functionality when in fact it is the fault of the router. A nice, cheap TP-Link router (available here, of course) can fix all of that.Disclaimer: I work in technology. I_ a manager of network administration. I understand these limitations and my expectations are appropriately calibrated.  Honesty, theses are basically fancy tuna cans. What did you think it was gonna sound like? Still the best sounding tuna can I own!",12

I am able to play music using the app, and the sound is the same as always but for some reason it seems the voice recognition is not working.

4,"It's louder, but ... slower?
  
",23.Nov.18,Yes,"The 3rd Gen Echo Dot is neat enough. It's considerably louder if you're just using the base unit. I sat it side by side with a 2nd Gen and linked them to play the same song at the same time, and I had to turn the 3rd Gen to Volume 3 to even hear the 2nd Gen. I don't use either of my Dots with their built-in speaker, so that's not really a selling point for me.The main problem I have with the 3rd Gen is that it seems to be a little slower to respond to the wake word - sometimes. The delay between ""Alexa"" and the light ring lighting up definitely seems to be slower - but it's a minor note because it doesn't affect the operation of the device. It'll still hear you say whatever you say after the wake word, and I've only had one time where I struggled to get it to listen to me for a moment.There was one other issue where it became unresponsive and went into setup mode for no apparent reason. In order to make it work again I had to de-register it in the app and reconnect it. It was odd, and I've never had that happen with a 2nd Gen.Still, for my purposes (having it connected to external speakers via 3.5mm cable), there's more or less nothing that makes the 3rd Gen any better than the 2nd. The mic seems to work just as well, though I haven't tried talking to it from across my home yet. My 2nd Gen can hear me through a closed door in the next room, so I'd assume the 3rd Gen is even better, but I haven't needed to try that yet. As I said before, the 3rd Gen's volume is greatly increased over the 2nd, so if you don't have yours connected to an external speaker, it would probably be well worth upgrading.",2

",23.Nov.18,Yes,"We_e had an Echo for a few years. Just one and it was the first that came out. Revisited the tech and updated this year. Added a smart plug, routines, reminders and bought three more dots when they went on sale for Black Friday. Two previous versions and this newer version.

So much better that I wish I_ spent the extra $5 to get the other two newer versions. 2) Easier to connect than previous models 3) Looks nicer 4) picks up sound better and so far understands things said from a greater distance 5) the sound is better ... no matter how many reviews say it_ not, don_ believe it. It_ better. Wish I didn_ believe it and bought the newer models!Voice commands. Love them!

5,"Easy Setup and Great Sound!
  
",23.Nov.18,Yes,"Of course, the setup was easy. Just plugged it in and it used my account information and set up with no added effort from me. It feels nice - the fabric outer shell. The response is fast, given the increased number of listening microphones. But the biggest difference for me between the 2nd generation and this 3rd is the sound. Huge improvement! And get this: IMHO the sound from the 3rd gen rivals the sound from the 1st gen Echo! I personally think it's better. I bought two for my workout room and paired them to play stereo. Very nice sound! I ended up grabbing a 3rd one for the bathroom!",2
4,"Greatly improved Dot, horrible power adapter!
  
",23.Nov.18,Yes,"Love it!!  The sound has been improved considerably, I can now use it without pairing to a different speaker.  Works better with the sleep sounds I use every night to relax.  The reason I am giving it 4 stars is because of the horrible chord and power adapter.  With my Echo Dot 2nd generation, everything fits in a case I bought for it (Dot and adapter and chord).  I bought a case for this 3rd generation, which fits the Dot perfectly, but there is absolutely no way this impractical and huge power adapter will fit inside, hope this detail is corrected as now I am stuck with a very nice case that cannot carry everything.",1

",23.Nov.18,Yes,"This is my second Alexa Dot, desiring to extend my network throughout the home, I elected to purchase a second device. Still a great product, unlimited possibilities, and an ever growing ""Skills"" list allow connections and communications with third party applications. The only thought I will express is the change in speaker tone; the 3rd generation has more bass tone effect in the speaker thus with my hearing defect it is difficult to understand the unit. My 2nd generation Alexa Dot has a more pleasant speaker tone which is easier to hear and understand. Perhaps with time this issue will become more pleasant or perhaps a firmware update in the future may serve to improve the sound quality.",1
5,"Extremely pleasantly surprised!!
  
",23.Nov.18,Yes,"Definitely an upgrade and so glad I purchased! I have the first gen Dot and the echo second generation and have loved both. I was also rather disappointed in the sound out of the first gen dot, but always had it hooked to other speakers. I was looking around at buying this one, but the reviews were mixed. Some said this wasn't even an upgrade and that the sound quality wasn't even noticeable. Ummmm...YES IT IS!! Much clearer and louder than the original with added depth and bass. Those that complain the speakers are still lacking...well this is the the speaker you put in a grand hall and expect to throw a dance party. No, get one of the bigger echos for something like that. But for clear, bedroom/kitchen filling audio -- you'll want one of these. I loved this one so much after seeing the difference that I'm tossing the old one and just bought a second third gen Dot.",1

",24.Nov.18,Yes,"It needs a volume control to increase the sound of the feedback after hearing the wake word. Not disabled-person friendly at all. Also, it doesn't seem to hear your voice as well as the 2nd generation Dot did. It like the look better, but overall it doesn't function as well as the last version.I came back to update my 2-star rating to 1-star. This thing hardly ever hears me unless I shout, and there's always a delay so I can't issue a command immediately following the wake word, but don't wait too long or it times out. My Google Home works flawlessly, so much that I bought another one, and with Google Home you can truly create useful routines, not the limited pre-programmed ones used with the Echo. Sorry, Amazon, I just can't find anything very useful with this anymore.",1
1,"This has the worst setup instruction
  
",24.Nov.18,Yes,The instructions and help people do not help you. They seem unfamiliar with the product,5
2,"Looks and sounds better, but hardly ever works
  
",24.Nov.18,Yes,"I'm really disappointed in this third generation dot.  My prior generations have worked like champs, but are pretty basic looking and sound pathetically tinny.  This third generation fixes both those problems, but at the cost of basic functionality.  I've had to set mine up three times already, and it will acknowledge commands and then not execute them 9 times out of 10.  Keeps losing wifi connection too.  Went back to my 2nd generation dot right next to this new one, with no problems.  Either I got a dud or these new ones are super finnicky.  And new, bigger adapter now takes up two spots on the power strip.  Inexplicable design choice.",2
5,"A level above the 2nd Gen Dot
  
",24.Nov.18,Yes,"I love the sound improvement with the 3rd Gen Dot. It's much richer, less ""tinny"" sounding, and louder than the 2nd gen.It took me a while to embrace the fact the 3rd gen requires I use the supplied AC adapter and has a barrel power plug rather than a mini-usb - I liked the versatility of the micr-usb connectior, but can understand that some people would connect their dot up to an insufficient usb power adapter. Since the Gen3 requires the AC adapter, there is no chance of providing insufficient power to the device.I like the soft fabric look of the gen3 too. It looks earily similar to a Google Mini.",0
5,"Great speaker and responsive
  
",24.Nov.18,Yes,"Have it on my night stand and use it for playing music and podcasts for when I go to bed. Much better alternative to a tv with all the bright flashing lights keeping me awake. I can also ask it the time and not have to reach for my phone which is my favorite part. Sound quality is pretty good for this size. It sounds like it_ mono which is the only bad lart, but the bass has good depth.",1
5,"Wow, sound is great improvement over last gen Dot!
  
",24.Nov.18,Yes,"Super lucky to grab this deal for a buck during Thanksgiving specials (along with Amazon Unlimited music for 3 months, 99cents per month).  I already have a 2nd gen Dot in the kitchen/living room area so this new one went in the bedroom.  The speakers on this new Dot is amazing - stereo sound that a whole new level compared to the 2nd gen Dot.  Amazing how Amazon has improved the sound quality.  If you play music even somewhat often on your Dot, getting the 3rd Gen Dot is a must!",0
5,"GREAT SOUND FOR SUCH A SMALL SPEAKER
  
",24.Nov.18,Yes,"I love this little thing! We have the Echo 2nd gen and I like it too.This one is heavier, so it's not as easily pulled around on a desk or tabletop. It still has the rubber on the bottom to keep it from sliding, but even with that, the small amount of extra weight just gives it more stability, I think.The sound is a lot better than the 2nd gen. It's clearer, and being able to change the equalizer is a nice touch, too.I think the sandstone is cute and practical.",0
5,"Que entiende idiomas
  
",25.Nov.18,Yes,Me encanta que habla español,163
3,"Really? A proprietary AC wall plug?
  
",25.Nov.18,Yes,"What could Amazon be thinking by giving the new Dot a HUGE, proprietary (kiss your micro USB plugins goodbye), AC adapter plug? This thing takes up a full outlet plug [15W adapter] and doesn't even have USB ports on the side to be useful. I'm sure Amazon heard all about inferior micro usb plugs being used with Alexa, and thus they went and made something universally worthless to ""fix"" the problem, rather than telling people to just use the better equipment they ALREADY OWN! Frankly, I don't care if the new one is ""new and improved"" when such a glaring step-down was taken with the actual, physical unit. I equally despise HP's proprietary power plugs for printers and laptops; what a scam! I'm sure Amazon is going to be more than happy to sell these plugs en-masse when they fail and Echo's are turned into non-working pieces of tech trash until you buy a new, expensive plug, rather than just pulling another Micro USB from your drawer! They could have at least went with USB-C; good grief.  I'm going to go read if Google was as equally stupid with their Mini this year, and if not....",18
4,"A very nice upgrade but would have liked to see more than the 3.5 out for older sound systems
  
",25.Nov.18,Yes,"Sound quality is not bad, better than the earlier generations of the echo dot but still not as good as say, a 1st generation Echo. I like to keep the volume at 5 on the 3rd gen echo dot, any louder and the sound limitations become more noticeable like the earlier gen dots, but the sound at 5 is perfectly adequate for a smaller room such as a bathroom where you do not want to place a large speaker for a multi-room music setup. For the price of $24 though (black friday), the 3rd gen dot is a steal.I would give this 5 stars, but I am deducting a star due to the lack of optical out or even coax.Getting a dot to work with various sound systems that don't have bluetooth has been a chore to say the least, a digital optical out would be nice on future generations for older sound systems that don't have bluetooth or even a special edition dot that has digital out with coax/optical/hdmi.For those with a Logitech Z5500, don't bother with an analog to digital converter. There will be a delay with multi-room music and from what I read, converting may decrease the sound quality. Best option I can see is to use a 3.5 stereo male to 3 aux female and use the included analog cable for the Z5500 to get the dot to play on the Logitech on all speakers. I couldn't find any info anywhere about this so troubleshooted it myself and sharing it here to save others the 2 hours I spent googling and searching various amazon products for a solution.Also, for stereo connections on other systems, such as an older Bose Solo, make sure you get a 3.5 to 2 cable stereo and not a 1 cord coax cord.  The mono cords or 3.5 to coax will not work (I believe because the echo dot outputs to analog and coax is digital).",1
1,"Just tired of repeating myself
  
",25.Nov.18,Yes,"Come on guys. How can these device get such great ratings? I have to repeat things to it over and over again. It can not pick up your voice from across yhe room, let alone when there is any noise in the room. Let alone music. I have the 2nd gen and 3rs gen. Both same thing. Its like OK google in the car. I just wish it had feelings so I could choke the life out of it.",5
3,"Crazy
  
",25.Nov.18,Yes,"I was looking forward to having an Echo again in my apartment. I had the 1st Echo, that big black one. And  I was mad excited about this one. First, maybe I should have placed it next to my Google Mini and not the Home. It was weak in turns of playing music, its like it's missing something. So I'm looking to upgrade to the New Echo that is $109, maybe. I'm only looking to have this control my microwave and ac united, maybe I will keep it due to the low price. Not too sure but I know I'm not to happy with the sound.",2
5,"Much Better than the 1st and 2nd Gen Dot
  
",25.Nov.18,Yes,"The sound of the 3rd Gen is so much better than the 1st and 2nd Gen dot. I was shocked when I tested out the 3rd Gen because it sounded like the full sized echo. It is probably not as good but rather than sounding like a poor quality speaker like the 2nd Gen, it sounded pretty rich. I uploaded a video and if you play it from your phone it is hard to notice the difference but both my wife and I were shocked how much better it was.",2
5,"Huge improvement in construction and audio
  
",25.Nov.18,Yes,Connects just as easily as the 2nd gen dots and easy add to the app. Physically almost twice as heavy which helps it to feel more solid  previous models.  Last thing....the sound! Can honestly say it as good as google devices. So impressed I_ going to start replacing all the other dots in the house. I tried attaching a video but amazon didn_ like the iPhone video for some reason.,2
3,"pairing two as stereo only works for requests made over device over like music unlimited.
  
",25.Nov.18,Yes,much better sound then previous version.  very full sound.however pairing to get stereo is a pain.  amazons wanting to box you into buying from amazon music rather then play your own music in stereo kills this device.  would prob be 5 star if it wasnt for silly things like this.  not paying 7.99 a month to actually use these.  if you try to play anything other then streaming services in stereo it will only play in one speaker only.  there is no reason for this other then artificially limiting your device.  so sadly these will go back..  well at least one.,1
3,"Much better sound than Gen 2!
  
",25.Nov.18,Yes,"Love that the sound is so much better than the last Echo Dot. Looks nicer too. Same old Alexa, of course.VERY disappointed that the plug has been changed from USB to proprietary. Not only does this mean that any problems with the cable will require a special buy, but the new plug is too big to fit nicely on a power strip. Since I have several USB ports on my power strip this was especially disappointing because instead of using one of my convenient USB ports I've had to switch to an oversize plug.",1
3,"Needs equalizer
  
",25.Nov.18,Yes,"The sound: It seems like the new generation has more bass, but it's not well-balanced at all, now I'm struggling to hear my podcasts/radio shows.  I don't WANT a bigger one, and I definitely don't want to throw money at a more expensive solution, but ... :(",2
5,"Compact package and decent sound quality
  
",25.Nov.18,Yes,"Nice upgrade to the 2nd generation Echo Dot.  The integrated speaker has good sound quality.  The small size is nice when shelf space is limited.  You also save one outlet and an external speaker, cable and so on.  If I could only hang this from a hook/nail or just through-hole mount to a wall stud with one screw.  Overall another winner from Amazon Echo line.Their Thanksgiving/Cyber Monday deal made buying this a no-brainer.  Oh, and it arrived in 2 days amidst the holiday rush...all around another wow!",0
5,"Great upgrade!
  
",25.Nov.18,Yes,"I received this new echo dot as a promotion for getting sirius xm.  Since I already had a couple of 2nd generation echo dots around the house I just thought that it would be great to have another one for free.  When I got the 3rd gen one and got it set up I realized that this one is much better quality than the 2nd gen ones.  The sound quality is way better than the previous dot and actually sounds comparable to my 1st gen echo.  Also, the sensitivity to voice commands seems better than the previous dot.  I can talk softer and still get a response.",0
5,"Never knew we needed Alexa until now!
  
",25.Nov.18,Yes,"After my family used an Echo Plus for a few days, it quickly became apparent we needed more of these in our house. I waited until the Black Friday sale ($24/Echo Dot) and picked up four of these for our house (and two more for gifts for Christmas). If you buy on the same Amazon account and have saved your Wi-Fi password during the initial Echo Device setup, then these will pair auto-magically and it only takes about 15-30 seconds after plugging them in to get Alexa up and running.",0
3,"Would have returned, missed window by one day...
  
",25.Nov.18,Yes,"Very nice build, great sound for small speaker! Three stars only cause I don't really have any use for it and a few small blocks...First, in the month I've had mine, I've asked what the weather is maybe 10 times and when it decides to work, would turn my Xbox One on/off.Also, cant play my own music through speaker... Huge downside, you can only use things like Amazon music or Spotify or something. I actually like owning my music and don't want to pay for a music service to stream music while also taking internet bandwidth from other things in the house. I don't need to call out specific artist/bands either, just being able to call out play/pause/shuffle would be great for my own music playing.I would have returned mine, but apparently it only has a one month return window and it is literally the day after... Nice if you can find uses I guess.",0
4,"IMPROVED sound quality/loudness  vs previous generations but still sounds muffled
  
",26.Nov.18,Yes,"UPDATE: Nov 28, 2018 - I have discovered that proper placement of the Echo Dot 3rd Gen is crucial to maximize the sound quality. If the echo dot is placed against a wall and/or under a cabinet (I had mine in the kitchen against the wall and under a cabiinet) the sound becomes more muffled and much of the midrange/treble is lost. On the other hand if you have the Echo Dot more in the open, like on a table and not right next to a wall or solid object, the sound will open up more, become less muffled and provides a better overall sonic experience.This is a review of the Echo Dot (3rd Gen) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal.I have Sonos One speakers, a Sonos Beam and 2-Echo Dot 2nd Generation speakers. I just had to purchase the new 3rd Generation Echo Dot to satisfy my curiosity.Wow, just blown away at the huge difference in sound quality compared to previous Echo Dot Generations. The 3rd Gen Dot has a 1.6"" speaker vs the 1.1"" speaker in the 2nd Generation Dot and it makes a profound difference in sound quality. The sound is richer, more full and has much more bass. It also plays significantly louder. If you are thinking of getting an Echo Dot, considering these improvements, there is little reason to get a 2nd Generation Echo Dot unless the difference in price is that big of an issue. Or perhaps the lack of a micro USB port will keep you away from the 3rd Generation.I will admit that I am irked that Amazon changed the power from USB powered to having to use the AC adapter that the 3rd Generation now uses. I hate wall warts and now the Echo Dot has one. It's also not nearly as convenient to have to worry about bringing a power adapter with you rather than using any old USB power. But what you give up in that department you more than make up for in sound quality.I like the appearance of the new Dot. It is more refined and has quite a bit more class. Folks with vision issues will also appreciate the fact that the buttons on the top of the Echo Dot have raised features that you can feel with your fingertips to differentiate between the buttons. Kudos to Amazon for that.The Echo Dot 3rd Generation is a big step up in quality over any previous generation of Dot. I would not hesitate to recommend the Echo Dot 3rd Generation if you are late to the party. It sill won't be an audiophiles first choice, but for the low cost this Echo Dot is a winner for the rest of us. In spite of the improved sound, it still has a muffled quality that I notice. So yes, the sound is better than previous Echo Dot generations, but it's still not excellent.You can connect to it via WiFi, or Bluetooth and the 3.5mm Aux Out (no cable included) enables you to easily send the sound to a more robust speaker that allows Aux In or to a legacy home stereo system if you desire.I didn't really need another Echo Dot in my house, but I'm glad I took the chance to check out a 3rd Generation Echo Dot. I'll happily retire one of my older 2nd Generation devices for this one.Thanks to bensound.com for the music used in my demonstration.",61
4,"Hopefully the Dot 3 is just having growing pains
  
",26.Nov.18,Yes,"The good news is the internal speaker is listenable, not bad even considering the size.  Compared to the Dot 2 the speaker is light years ahead.  Aesthetically, the 3 is 10x more appealing than the 2.  It feels substantial, not plastic-y.  Microphone-wise, I am not seeing much difference between the 3_ far field 4 mikes and the 2_ seven mikes...call it even.  The bad news is, at least for me, the Bluetooth connection to external speakers is (was) waaaaayyyyy buggy.  I tried it with a Bose Sound Dock equipped with a Bluetooth 30 pin converter and a regular Bluetooth speaker both of which functioned flawlessly with the Dot 2 right out of the box.  The 3 had a terrible Bluetooth connection.  So much so that I ended up calling Amazon for help.  Annalise was great BTW...we ended up resetting the 3 and that seems to have fixed the issue...but then it made my WiFi smart plug start acting buggy...I fixed that on my lonesome.Once you get past the tin-foil hat aspect of having this thing listening to every word, it_ a freaking cool concept and the 3 elevates the sound game exponentially over the 2.  For $24 on Prime Alexa sale it_ near the price of a stand alone alarm clock radio and is infinitely more useful.  Once the bugs get worked out I think I_l love this thing.  An added bonus is if I say Echo, murder, blood...the cops should be here quicker than a 911 call ;)",5
5,"Improvements for the go-to personal assistant
  
",26.Nov.18,Yes,"This is our first 3rd Gen Echo Dot, our #6 Dot in total, and a couple of full sized models as well.  We've been using these devices for several years in a whole home network and overall really enjoy their 5-star versatility, which this review will not go into. Instead focusing on the 3rd gen Dot's improvements/functionality.Amazon has the initial setup really dialed in.  Unboxed, plugged it in, and it was 100% ready to go in less than 1 minute with me only needing to have the Alexa app on my phone open -- automatically set up Amazon account, WiFi and location information.Appearance-wise, it's a very significant departure (and upgrade) from prior models.  You can instantly visually see it's the latest model and in my opinion the appearance is significantly improved.  It really looks sharp with the cloth surround and slightly bowed out grill which I assume has something to do with the larger speaker in this new model.  The new appearance is elegant and really makes the first two gens look stark by comparison.Voice command response (in our unoffical testing) seems to be slightly snappier despite there being 4 microphones versus the 7 of prior generations.  Not sure if this is due to improved processing or better microphones or maybe both, but it's slightly better in hearing my wife and kids.Speaker sound quality is improved.  Granted that it wouldn't be hard to improve on the sound quality of a prior gen Dot, but none of the Dots, including the latest is a very big device, but for it's size the device it sounds good, and the latest gen definitely hits a greater range (more bass notes).  When we have all of our Dot/Echo devices playing music sync'd throughout the our home, as a whole home system they sound good.Overall the 3rd gen isn't such a groundbreaking upgrade that we'd plan on ordering 6 units right now today to replace our perfectly fine functioning previous gen 1&amp;2 Dots, but moving forward the 3rd gen does significantly set itself apart -- both physically and sound-wise, enough so that I likely wouldn't buy a significantly discounted prior gen and all future orders will be gen 3's.",2
5,"Dots Just Keep on Getting Better
  
",26.Nov.18,Yes,"I am a fan of Alexa. I have or have had just about every Echo device Amazon has manufactured, plus some third party...for my car, Bose 500 Speaker, and the Bose 700 Soundbar. Throughout  this, since the release of the first Dot, there have been Alexa Dots in my life. This is the best yet. Sure the footprint is a little bigger, but I like that. The cloth cover is attractive and has a nice feel. This Dot 3E connected to my household WiFi immediately. The sound is much improved. Overall a better Dot. In fact, after the first, I went back and bought two more. I travel frequently in my work, and one of them will go in my suitcase. These days Dot works well in an hotel room. Highly recommended.",2
5,"Great Job Amazon!
  
",26.Nov.18,Yes,"Glad I waited for Black Friday sales.  I was tempted to purchase one of these 3rd Gen Dots and had to wait and see if a better deal was on the way, and it was.  Two for the price of one!  The sound is amazing and ALMOST EQUAL to the new echo I purchased last year (almost, but no bass on this one).  I would not kid you, the sound is so noticeable fuller and of a higher quality I do not know how they kept the price the same.  The look is so much more _igh end I do not think anyone will feel the need to cover it up with cases, skins, or anything.  Just let this beautiful dot hang out naked on your bedroom night stand and do her thing.  You will be glad you did.",0
3,"Changed power cord!
  
",26.Nov.18,Yes,Just got the Dot 3rd gen. They changed the power cord from micro USB to a fixed proprietary cord and charger! Why would you do that? Seems like a step back! I would have thought they would switch to USB C.,3
2,"Real pain to keep awake
  
",26.Nov.18,Yes,"Amazon has a long way to go with these devices.  I have 2 2nd generations and 1 3rd.  One of my biggest complaints is keeping it awake and listening.  Even though I have set it in the app to stay awake longer, I have to keep calling it's name to wake it up again because I wasn't finished with it.  Amazon needs to change the programming to give it an option to stay awake until the user tells it to go to sleep",1
5,"Echo Shrunk
  
",26.Nov.18,Yes,"I feel compelled to write a few words about this 3rd Gen Echo Dot. I kid you not, it sounds as good as the full Echo. I don't know how they managed to compact it into this little thing, but it sounds nothing like the 1st or 2nd gen dots. I bought several 3rd gen dots for little more than twenty dollars each during Black Friday and Cyber Monday. THIS will make great gifts (make sure to click 'for gift' checkbox, so Amazon doesn't automatically put your account to the device before shipping.)",0
5,"Echo Dot is just the coolest product!
  
",27.Nov.18,Yes,"This device is so handy!  Some months ago I originally bought a 2nd generation Echo Dot from Amazon (it worked great), but it is has mysteriously gone missing in the meantime, probably got pushed under a sofa accidentally somewhere here in the  house.  So I bought this 3rd generation Dot a couple of weeks ago.  The initial setup was a little clumsy--probably my own fault--but once I completed the setup (calling the device ""David's 2nd Echo Dot"" in the setup procedure carried out using my cellphone's installed Alexa app), it has performed beautifully.  The sound out of this little guy is superb; the Alexa app includes an equalizer that actually works quite well.  Every day I get music (from Amazon and Pandora), news, reminders, to-do lists, etc., via a simple shout-out to ""Alexa"".  There are loads of other Alexa ""skills"" and ""routines"" I still have to check out.I just received my second 3rd generation Echo Dot today, and its setup went quickly (&lt; 1 minute) and flawlessly without even invoking the cellphone's Alexa app.  It registered itself automatically as ""David's 3rd Echo Dot"".  Both 3rd generation Echo Dots can run simultaneously, e.g., with two different music sources.  I changed the ""Wake Word"" on one of the Dots to ""Amazon"" (the other is the default ""Alexa"") so that the two devices (and I) don't get confused.I would recommend the Echo Dot without hesitation, and this seller, too.  BTW, I have a third Echo Dot on order from Amazon right now, so each of the three (and the original 2nd generation Echo Dot, too, if it ever resurfaces) will soon be set up in separate parts of the house (my wi-fi router blasts out a good-quality signal around the whole place).So I am now an Echo Dot junkie.  I have no need to get the fancier Echo devices with their visual displays, as all that I ever need in this regard I can get via the cellphone-based Alexa app.",1
1,"Product was returned along with ALEXIS in the same box AMAZON shipped it to me in.
  
",27.Nov.18,Yes,"After seeing 60 Minutes and t/w my work IT dept I decided not to keep this or Alexis. Sent it back and now I realize I should have printed 2 labels but they both came in the same box!  I keep getting notices that I need to return it and I  have.  I can't email AMAZON and can find no where to let them know. Maybe they can respond to this. In all my years with AMAZON this is the first complaint I've had and the 4th time I have ever returned something.  Maybe I'm missing it.  There was nothing wrong with the product that I know of, I didn't even take it out of the box.  Just opened and closed.  I returned Alexis so one would gather I don't need this.",3
5,"Pretty cool
  
",27.Nov.18,Yes,"This is a nifty little device. Setup takes about 10 minutes via the Amazon Alexa app- isn_ too big of a deal. We mostly use it for playing music, checking weather, etc. We don_ have it paired with lights or door locks or any of that kind of stuff that I_ to understand it can control as well. It can tell jokes and answer some funny questions. The only thing I could say could be improved is sometimes there is a solid 3-4 second delay between asking it something and it_ answer. It_ very small, sleek, not obnoxious looking. I have 3 Dots and an Echo in the house to accommodate my needs for different rooms. I have seen some complaints about the Dot_ speaker- I have found no issue with it, if you are just casually listening to music while you cook, or having it read you recipe directions or something, this device is perfectly fine.",1
5,"It's Great
  
",27.Nov.18,Yes,"We're in our 70's but can't let technology march on without us. We wanted to make our house up-to-date. Even if we didn't ""Need"" it, we wanted it. So much fun. We talk to it all the time. We make reminders, we have other shopping lists named for stores we shop at. We ask for our news station on Radio.com, or our 60's music on Pandora. We drop-in from upstairs to downstairs without having to yell through the house. We attached smart plugs and turn lights on and off in different rooms by voice command; we have timers and our bedroom lights go on and off on schedule. We say ""Goodnight"" and get a different Goodnight response with our names nightly. My husband bought Nest thermostats from the Electric Company PSEG (they were offering a deal with an energy rebate). We didn't get them yet so I can't comment on how they work.",1
3,"it's ok, but...........
  
",27.Nov.18,Yes,"I like that it's fairly fast but hate that it requires way too much personal info in order to do much of anything other then play music or give you the weather conditions. And talking about music. I #$%^&amp; HATE iHEART radio (or any traditional over the air radio station for that matter). I will not pay for music streaming from any source when I have thousands of songs already that I normally listen to at home and in the car, Thankfully I can find stuff I like on 'TuneIn' but it's a pain to have to specify the exact channel each and every time I want it to play. And even then, some channels you can only get to by  going through the POS mobile phone app. If I ask Echo (the device) to play a certain channel that I was listening to the day before, it says it can't for various reasons. Yet I can turn on wifi on my phone, fire up the app, go though TuneIn and select the channel and it plays fine. If I was playing a certain channel hours before, the day before or days  ago when I last listened to music, I should be able to just say ""Echo, play"" and it should play the last station I selected. But it doesn't. It defaults to some crappy country station on IHeart and I hate Country music worse then I hate iHeart radio/over-the-air-radio-stations in general. I hate that it can't go over the net and play internet based stations (like DI.FM) that aren't listed in 'TuneIn"".It's ok for asking about the weather while you're busy running around in what ever room you are in. Other then that. I haven't used it for much else and refuse to let it do things that require it to have personal info about me and store it on the $%^&amp; cloud.",1

They all answer to Alexa and sometimes, since I have so many, the wrong one hears me.  A minor annoyance.I also have Insteon door sensors, garage door opener, light switches, outlets for lamps (some are TP Link), Honeywell Thermostat (I have a heat pump and the Nest wasn't right for me), an August front door lock.

Buy now while it_ still on sale! You won_ be disappointed!!",0
3,"Blows previous generations away with sound, but amazon wants to make you sign up for unlimited...
  
",27.Nov.18,Yes,"Sound is much better than previous. So glad I upgraded. However, amazon is ruining them. Unless you have amazon unlimited, prime songs are constantly being moved to unlimited and then unavailable to prime members. You may ask for a song and Alexa will play a _tation associated. Or she plays something completely different. Also, I have multiple echos, and the closest one is supposed to respond. That hasn_ been happening lately...the one in the other room may respond instead.",0
2,"VERY POOR sound quality
  
",28.Nov.18,Yes,"I have a 2nd gen Echo Dot, a Google Home Mini and now the 3rd gen Echo Dot.The Alexa functionality is great on both and Amazon has done a wonderful job. I like the overall design of the new version. That is where the positives end.I actually think the sound is better on the 2nd gen Echo Dot. The 3rd gen is much louder but is still lacking in the sound quality. The sound on the 3rd gen is very flat. Listening to music is not enjoyable on the new generation Dot. My Google Home Mini has a much better sound quality and I was hoping the new device would be closer in that aspect.I prefer the Alexa devices over the Google devices for voice commands (even though the Google devices have a better sense of humor). I use my 2nd gen Echo Dot as my daily alarm and have been very happy with it for some time.I am not expecting great sound quality from such a small device. I can not understand why Amazon thought this was acceptable.Amazon -- PLEASE improve the sound quality on the next version.",4
2,"Badly over-emphasized base
  
",28.Nov.18,Yes,"I have lots of 2nd gen Echo Dots and wanted to like the new 3rd gen Echo Dot.  Unfortunately I couldn't get past the change in fidelity to a larger driver that over-emphasizes base frequencies and under-emphasizes the rest (like the taller new Echo).  The only improved thing about it as far as I can tell is that it can get louder and pair with another in a stereo arrangement.  I can compensate by using an equalizer and external amplified speakers (great result that way), but what's the point in paying 3 times for what could've been done right the first time.  (BTW, before you ask, let me add that you can't just ask Alexa to turn down the base -- that turns down *all* base frequencies, not just the over-emphasized boomy ones. )  For regular rooms I prefer the older 2nd gen Echo Dot or Echo to the newer ones.",4
5,"3rd Generation...a step up....
  
",28.Nov.18,Yes,"I had seven (7) Echo devices (in my home) before purchasing this one (24 bucks was just too good to pass up).  This one was easier to set up (not that the previous generations were hard...).  I have both Gen 1 and Gen 2 Dots but this one is a big improvement because it looks and feels like a better product (pure aesthetics) but in concrete terms it sounds MUCH better than the previous two Dots have sounded.  I bought JBL Flip 4's which I have hard-wired to the others in order to get acceptable sound (while still in a small space).  They have worked out well and sound great (best BlueTooth speakers I've had), but the 3rd generation sounds fully acceptable (with music) on it's own and I'm not sure I would have bought a JBL to go with it had the others been this good.  That, in addition to a more refined ""look &amp; feel"" make this most popular Echo model a clear winner from my point of view.  Over the almost 3 years that I've had Echos, they have continually expanded in usefulness.  I live alone (am 74) and frankly enjoy having a voice in the house...but she handles music, lights, thermostat, garage door, ordering pizza, reordering Amazon items (previously ordered), etc.  So I get a lot of use out of these units in every room in my house that I frequently occupy.  The total lack of latency problems in music groups is, frankly, quite amazing to me.  Basically, I'm an Apple guy, but the Echo products were first to market and I'm very satisfied with the products and the progress that they've made over these 3 years.  Also, I'm very appreciative of the fact that each new version of Echo does NOT obsolete the previous versions...I have the original Echo ""tower""... it's on the nightstand in my bedroom ... it still sounds great and responds to my every (Alexa specific) command.  Don't get me wrong, this is not AI in the purest sense...you really can't hold a conversation with Alexa...but for what she does, I am fully satisfied...and she does a lot...all day long (and into the night).",1
1,"Doesn't work
  
",28.Nov.18,Yes,"It takes 4 minutes to locate the Echo. Then it says to setup wifi manually, even tho my wifi works fine. Then when I select their amazon wifi it says it's connected and the light changes to red or pink and the  app bails out to the start page. It does this over and over and never connects. Nice packing too, Th small Dot box was thrown in a 12x12x12 box with no packing and had a very rough ride. Pitiful.",4
4,"There is one potential issue
  
",28.Nov.18,Yes,"Compared to the old one this thing looks sophisticated....not like a hockey puck.  The sound is so much better than the old one.  In fact I have my old dot on a little shelf you can buy that attaches to your wall outlet.  Its so nice to hear the news or music while shaving/dressing showering. But the older echo sounded pretty crappy even in the bathroom.  This one sounds GREAT.  I mean it wont replace it taller older brother but the sound is commendable.Here is my problem.  The old one had a cord that pugged into the echo on one end and plugged into the plug on the other.  You were thus able to get a real short (3"") cord to use when you put the dot on it's little shelf attached to the wall outlet.The new one, in all its glory is very difficult to put on the little shelf.  The wire is part of the plug an cannot be replaced with a shorter cable.  Maybe eventually a shortie plug will be sold but for now I have this great looking echo sitting in front of a bunch up cord...it does not look so great...hope it's safe to have the cord continually bound up too!",1
5,"AMAZING, GREAT SOUND, LOUD, 3rd Gen Dot, I LOVE EM!!!
  
",28.Nov.18,Yes,"I_e seen several reviews saying the sound isn_ much better on the 3rd generation from the 2nd generation, this is one I have to disagree with the other reviewers! My 3rd Gen Dot_ sound is significantly better then my other 2nd gen Dots! My new 3rd Gen fills my large frontroom with music/sound. In fact it can be heard from other adjacencent rooms too! The new Dot is pretty close in the level of sound that my 2nd gen show puts out, which is really quite loud! Honestly from the reviews I read about the 3rd Gen dot I almost didn_ buy them thinking the volume of sound wouldn_ be near loud enough comparing them to the 2nd Gen Dots I already own that are not all that loud. But I_ glad I took the chance and bought 2 of these 3rd Gen Dots, cause they do sound amazing and are more then plenty loud. BTW, that_ coming from a old cabinet maker that_ had his hearing lost significantly from using loud equipment for decades! If I can more then easily hear these, then anyone with normal hearing certain can too! If their not loud, try turning up your volume on your Dot! Personally I can_ say one bad thing about these new 3rd Gen Dots, I_ very impressed! My old 2nd gen Dots are now in our bathroom paired to our new ceiling vents that have Bluetooth speakers. Perfect use of my 2nd gen Dots! No need for extra Bluetooth speakers on my 3rd Gen Dots, plenty of bass for me and you can adjust your bass, etc. on your Alexa app too! Unless you_e wanting ear bleeding sound, you won_ be disappointed with the 3rd Gen Dots!",0
2,"No Top end. An attempt to create something wonderful.
  
",28.Nov.18,Yes,"An attempt to create a small speaker with good sound. Unfortunately if you are into at least a basic decent sound, this product fails. It's just a lot louder than the older generation of Echo Dot's. Quality of sound...nope.The ""sound"" is an attempt to create a larger sound but, the sound is compressed flat and an awful basic bassey sound. Maybe it's Amazon's attempt at streaming at 32 Kbp/s ? That's what it sounds like....Stereo pairing is a joke along with trying to integrate with the older Echo Dot's. It was painfully difficult to pair or even set up. The delay when using the app to skip an Amazon track is ridiculously slow..to connect with all speakers is bloody awful. You are much better off with Apple's Airplay system even with the outdated Airport Express's.If you want to use this system, please use it in the bathroom when you are having a shower. That's about it.I'm sending it back. Not even worth integrating with Amazon's Eco' Echo system. The older speakers are clearer and are a lot more responsive. Very disappointed.",1
3,"Must  install FireTV Service provider 'app' within Alexa app to pair with FireTV Stick
  
",28.Nov.18,Yes,"Overall the build and quality of the 3rd gen Echo Dot appears to be of solid quality.  It seems that in order to harness much of the functionality of the Echo Dot the Amazon Alexa App must be installed on your phone.  This is the first time I've used the Alexa app (and this is my first Echo Dot).  In the past I've had a high regard for Amazon products and their value but right now I must say that I'm a little underwhelmed by Alexa app and the Dot mostly because the Alexa app doesn't seem to be  too fluid (it lags and is not as responsive as one would expect).  Also as written above, if you want to connect the Dot to the fire tv stick you have to select the FireTV 'app' (for lack of a better term) within the app to do this pairing.  It would have been more logical to  be able to pair the devices under the device settings.  Other than that the Dot seems to what its supposed to do and is quite responsive.Another disappointment is that the Echo Dot cannot be used as a Bluetooth speaker for the TV / Fire TV stick (I was under the impression that it could be used as such but perhaps I should have done more in-depth research on it).",0
5,"Alexa grew an Adam_ apple.
  
",28.Nov.18,Yes,"Very impressed. I got an echo dot gen 1 two years ago and love it. This year I thought I_ ask for an echo plus for the better sound quality and the hub would be cool but not necessary, a plus if you will. Well my gf got me this gen 3 dot based on price and from the second Alexa greeted me while booting up I_e been blown away with the sound. I have a small home and the gen 1 did well giving me enough sound all throughout the house; this one is leaps and bounds better sound quality. The bass and mid tones are great with a bit of eq fiddling. I think the look is a nice improvement but I do like the hard corners of the older model. I am not at all mad I got the echo dot 3 instead of the echo plus I asked for (and it was $85 cheaper).",0
5,"Much improved sound
  
",28.Nov.18,Yes,"I bought a 2nd gen Dot the last time they were on sale for $25. I like it a lot, other than the mediocre speakers, so I leave that one constantly plugged in to an audio input on my sound system.This newer one, though, has WAY better audio. It's good enough to justify itself just as a portable speaker, not even considering the Alexa functionality.As a bonus, I placed this in my garage, far enough away from my wireless router where my phone just barely hangs onto a signal, and the Echo works fine, just a tiny bit delayed on voice commands.TL;DR it's just like the 2nd gen echo, except a little larger, a little better looking, and with good enough speakers to stand on its own.",1
4,"Alexa is learning!
  
",28.Nov.18,Yes,"I was immediately able to play the music I liked and control my lights and ask about my calendar, as I had those things already synced to my Alexa app. It is super duper tiny. It fits in the palm of my hand. It's so cute and discreet! There were some abstract questions I asked Alexa: queries like good ideas to do on a cold day spent indoors. Alexa doesn't know that one, but she is learning. However, I am thrilled to have her help in my home. I even had a friend over and was able to play Trivial Pursuit with them through Alexa. It was a fantastic experience. I can't wait for Alexa to learn more. ^_~",0
3,"Needs help understanding simple sentences
  
",28.Nov.18,Yes,"It doesn't have all the answers,  it's not like asking a computer,  it more like asking Amazon,  Alexa can answer simple questions and follow simple commands but for example I was asking Alexa to find a show called ""Channel Zero"" on syfy , and she kept telling me there was nothing under the name zero,  I had to look it up manually . And it's not that I'm being lazy but isn't it her job to find things for me? Another big problem is that its super difficult to add echo dots around the house , they just dont seem to want to connect to one another its frustrating to install",0
5,"Must have for tech savvy family!
  
",28.Nov.18,Yes,Overall great! The sound quality is amazing for such a small speaker. It can hear me say Alexa when I can_ even hear myself. The blue light when it hears you is very noticeable so you can tell if she hears you. I made a few of my own skills and I love how personalizable it is. I where when my husband comes home it tells him what I need help with for the day such as chores. I also made a skill of flash cards and quizzes so I can study for my exams for class. I absolutely love it! We bought a second one for upstairs for our smart lights that came with the bundle.,0
5,"What is to think about? Everyone needs Dots around the house.
  
",28.Nov.18,Yes,I love this dot! I ordered a pack of 3. I gave my mom one. She is 87 and loves her Dot. Alexa reminds her to take her prescription medication everyday at the same time so she doesn_ forget. I ask for the weather report every morning to start my day. This is a great assistant for everyday reminders and to keep up with what you need to know. Worth every penny. I also have the Echo a Show wrapped up for Christmas for my mom. She is going to love that we can see each other to talk when Im away from home.,0

",28.Nov.18,Yes,Looks better and sounds better than the 2nd generation dot.

And most disappointing is they changed the power plug so NONE of the accessories I have for the 2nd gen dot will work with it.Returning it. I will stick with the 2nd generation dot rather than purchase all new accessories.,0

",28.Nov.18,Yes,"I have two of the 2nd generation dots.  I upgraded because I read the audio was better. I won_ lie. The 2nd gen was awful Audio. I got a regular echo for music and connected one of them via aux to a speaker. I figured for the holiday price, it wouldn_ hurt to see what the audio improvement really was.I have to say. I wouldn_ say it_ the best audio ever, but it_ got more bass and a better sound. I am impressed. And I_l probably get a second one to pair stereo sound.Def impressed.",0

This could have been life saving tech and it isn't unless you have a landline or VOIP and yet another gadget to connect. I am so disgusted with this thing!I am looking into the VOIP thing and the connect gadget, but the level of complication, cost, and inconvenience makes this completely unsuitable for many seniors and leaves me wondering why this crippled tech is so popular in the first place.

",29.Nov.18,Yes,"I'm not going to comment on all the wonderful features of this device. Everything seems to work well, except the sound of Alexa's voice. I have listened to a few voices on news feeds &amp; Jimmy Kimmel jokes &amp; the voices sound OK. Alexa, on the other hand sounds very muffled &amp; chesty. I have treble &amp; mid all the way up &amp; bass all the way down trying to get rid of the tubby/muffled sound of her voice. EQ didn't help. In my opinion, this device should get the voice right first &amp; foremost. I don't expect to play music through it with any fidelity, so it's primary purpose is to talk to me &amp; Amazon got this wrong in their attempt to have it all. Hopefully this can be fixed with their tweaking her voice, or giving us alternative voices that are more intelligible. Disclaimer, I am an audiophile &amp; am used to listening to high quality equipment. My expectations for the Echo Dot's sound quality was low, but I was surprised that the Alexa voice was so bad. I am extremely grateful that they included an audio out though. It's so ironic that Alexa's voice is so poorly implemented. Please give us a new voice or a better EQ. Thanks for that &amp; all the other features. Well worth the money.",2
4,"Amazon Echo Dot Gen 3 - Setup Unacceptable with Samsun phone
  
",29.Nov.18,Yes,"12/3/2018 UpdateAmazon contacted me to say they reproduced my problem and apologized. Samsung changed the setting names. I still don't like that they required this setting turned off- requiring such on a phone is an imposition. Given that Amazon has generally been good to me, I'm giving them back two stars.I already have an Echo and a Dot. I expected that I would be able to easily setup the Echo 3. Not so- it took at least a half hour to setup. It would not allow setup without Smart Switch enabled on my phone. There is no such setting- it's labeled something else. Furthermore, while I made a good guess at what it was labelled, turning it off did not allow setup to proceed, although the setup procedure was designed to do so. So I spun my wheels for what seemed forever trying to find what Alexa wanted. Finally, the Dot exited setup mode, I had to exit device setup in the app, and it worked. Not cool. Final comment- I don't want that setting turned off.I just bought two Google minis to try. All the reviews say Alexa is better at device control, but the Googles are much better at answering questions, and catching up on device control. Alexa has a real battle in my world.",0

Cute as heck and they added Bass...Bump.. for a tiny little thing that she is she stands pretty proud in a room with sound at lower volumes. She lost the ""tinny"" sound of the plastic cocoon she was tapped in with a rim of outlets around the top to produce sound. The sound now radiates from the sides. If your already a Alexa owner the setup process is as easy as plugging it in. It finds your internet and sets itself up with no need to use the Alexa App. This is a very nice upgrade from the Gen2. I'd buy another one.",0

3,"Best for home automation and IFTTT, bad for everything else
  
",30.Nov.18,Yes,"I am a Google Home house. The only reason I got one Echo Dot is because there is more support and customization for home automation via IFTTT and the fact it dropped to $24 for BF. However, I used to be a Alexa user. The thing with Alexa is, you're spending more time setting up skills to make it adapt to YOUR lifestyle. Alexa is a bad conversationalist, can't work off continued conversations and has a harder time understanding foreign accents/childrens voices compared to other voice assistants on the market. Skills and customization (like IFTTT) is Alexa's selling-point, but you have to invest a lot of time in skills to make her second nature to your life. The thing I HATE about Alexa and skills is that you have to talk really long phrases like, ""Alexa, open [skill] and play [specific request]"" so for example you have to say, ""Alexa open SLEEP SOUNDS and play Waterfall"" . That is just one example, but you find yourself talking really long commands because skills can't run by themselves. you always have to tell Alexa to open a skill then use the skill, and that gets very very cumbersome when you are supposed to have many skills for your personal customization. Like I said, I ONLY have one in the Living room for IFTTT because the major smart-home-product companies release Alexa commands over Google Home commands. As a personal assistant, she's just too much work. Why I like GH is because it just works straight out of the box, you don't have to spend months to have it customized to your every whim to make it specifically tailored to you. Amazon might not even publish this review but this is my honesty.",43
3,"Sound issues
  
",30.Nov.18,Yes,"The unit looks great and sounds great... SOMETIMES.  Just started using it and once the speaker cut out.  Also about half the time the sound has a buzzz and the voice is ""staticky."" I am on the phone with Amazon now, and it sounds like this is an issue they are encountering in other units.  They were willing to send me a refurbished replacement initially, and now they are hesitating to do that since they are ""afraid"" the next unit will have the same problem.  As we continue to speak, I am told they will send me the refurbished unit as long as I understand that there is already an open ticket on this 3rd generation echo dot and the problem may also be found in the new unit.  I really hope they figure out the problem because when this dot plays without the distortion the speaker sounds really great!  I will try to update this when the refurb arrives.  The customer service was quite good.  They really did try to help.  This is a new product and there is always a risk when purchasing a new device that there may be bugs.UPDATE:The unit is working a bit better as of late.  It isn't always distorted. It may not be the manufacturing. Could slight internet interference cause this? Dont know. Will keep testing.",4
3,"Disappointing
  
",30.Nov.18,Yes,"I just received the newest Dot (3) device; I am quite interested in many of its features.

I have a JBL Flip 2 speaker, TaoTronics Wireless 4.1 Magnetic Earbuds, and B_HM Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Active Noise Cancelling Headphones Technology. NONE of these apparently will be connected with Dot. The JBL works fine with wired connection, but hardly the point for bluetooth use. You should not advertise the Dot as ""able to connect with bluetooth devices"" when you are very limited in the kinds of devices able to be connected. Very disappointed given my usual experiences with Amazon products.",1

(Not quite as much base, but for something that is only Speaker no Woofer or Tweeter I'm very impressed)I will have to buy another one for my mother because she is obsessed. I upgraded us to the family plan of Amazon Music as well, and playing music through the house is so much fun, especially with Christmas coming up.Alexa herself also works great for setting timers, morning alarms, and even for starting the day.Most recently I was organizing my spice cabinet and talked to my Kitchen Alexa, I was able to ask""Alexa what is Turmeric used for?"" ""Alexa what can I substitute for Oregano?"" and got fast understandable answers for both. (Siri response? : I'm not sure"" )To be fair sometimes Alexa doesn't have a response either, but overwhelmingly I have had a great time and really enjoy this. I will be sure to slowly upgrade all of mine to these new ones.",0

Doesn_ connect to my home_ hub though, which sucks because it_ a known retailer brand. I can see how handy this would be if I had another set up in my living room &amp; 1 more downstairs. Will look out for deals if I end up liking this a lot.",0
5,"Amazon managed to improve on the original tenfold.
  
",30.Nov.18,Yes,"The new version is beefier and more solid, sounds better, looks better, and responds faster. I didn_ think I could love a Dot as much as I loved the original but here I am, corrected. The first thing I noticed when I took the Echo Dot out of the box was how heavy it was.  The heft of the new Echo Dot makes it feel a lot more premium than the original version.  With competing products like the Apple HomePod, Amazon needed to re-design their cheapest product to look and feel just as nice.  And they succeeded.Set up a simple and it was ready to go within seconds.  The only con I would say about the new version is that it no longer use a USB cord and instead uses an AC adapter. However, that_ nothing when the product is amazing as this is.Oh, and I got it for $25. Literally couldn_ get a better deal.",0
1,"Horrible speaker
  
",30.Nov.18,Yes,"Not impressed.  I have a 2nd gen dot as well.  The speaker on that isnt bad.  This one is plain awful.  I don't know if I just got a bad one or not, but you can't listen to any music on it like I could with the old one.  The static is just insane.  Really really bad.  It also took me over an hour to set up unlike the couple of minutes the old one took.",2
5,"Family friendly!
  
",30.Nov.18,Yes,"Our household is officially hooked. The Echo Dot was the first to join us two weeks ago. Since then, we have added an Echo for our living room and a second Echo Dot underneath the Christmas tree for our boys to keep in their bedroom.This thing has so much to offer. Some of our favorite features are:- The _dd to my shopping/to do list. This is great for those things that cross your mind and you totally forget if you don_ write them down. Having those commands allows us to make a note without having to stop what we are doing.-Unlimited Amazon Music. Totally worth a few extra bucks to be able to stream our music on up to six devices at a time. I can listen to my stuff while working in the kitchen and the kids can listen to theirs upstairs without interrupting one another.- The Drop-In feature. This is great because my husband or I can drop in at home from our cellphones and talk to our kids through the echo when one of us isn_ home. We can also send each other messages through voice command, which is simple enough that our elementary aged kids can do.I could go on and on. Take the plunge, get the product, worth every single penny!",0
5,"Amazon did an amazing job on the audio
  
",30.Nov.18,Yes,"I have the second generation Echo Dot, the second generation Echo, and now this 3rd generation Echo Dot.  I can safely tell you that this little 3rd gen. echo dot is a huge leap over the 2nd gen. one in terms of audio and build quality.  It gets very loud for a little speaker and would be perfect for a large bedroom or even a kitchen.  I use this to set alarms, turn off xmas decorations and lights around the house etc.  Love the product do not hesitate especially if you can get it on sale!  (i purchased this with a smart plug for 30 bucks on amazon because they were running a deal on it)",0
5,"Impressive sound for the size
  
",30.Nov.18,Yes,"I have had the 2nd generation echo dot for about a year now and I really enjoy it. The sound is ok but I really wouldn't use it to listen to music on its own, I just pair it with my TV soundbar. This little 3rd gen has such impressive sound I will probably use it listen to music in my bedroom at least. I like that you can assign different wake words (Alexa, Echo, Amazon, Computer) so that you don't trigger both echo dots at once (since I have a small apartment this is important to me). It's also nice to have a second one so that I can control both of my FireTV sticks with voice commands.",0
3,"Hopefully they get better
  
",30.Nov.18,Yes,So far I am disappointed with the _pgraded Echo Dot :/ I connected the first one in my room (next to my bed) replacing the 2nd gen so it_ not used as often but I_e noticed it doesn_ pick my voice up as quickly as my old one and it_ slow to respond. I connected the 2nd 3rd gen in our living room right next to the couch just a few days ago and find it_ also frustratingly slow to respond. I have no issues with our 2nd gen and i am regretting not buying the Amazon Echo 2nd gen in favor of 2 3rd gen. The only real positive thing I can say is they are louder and gen2.,0
5,"Dotty Over It
  
",30.Nov.18,Yes,"I got my youngest kid a second generation one. What? He's not an audiophile and still can crank it up too loud. This one is for me. Says it all, right? It's an alarm clock. It's a stereo. It's NPR. It controls the lights. It's Alexa. They sound is good, with great tone, shockingly pleasing bass. Amazon ability to create stereo in a near-Bose fashion is impressive. Of course my main room has a full-size Echo (with a planned subwoofer) but this is a superior tiny music machine. Amazon is practically giving these away to get us hooked - and it works. But I can quit any time I want.",0
5,"3rd gen dot is significantly better
  
",30.Nov.18,Yes,"This is our third Alexa-enabled device, having started with a 2nd gen dot then picking up a 2nd gen Echo.  We really liked both of those, primarily for music and setting up a daily Flash Briefing, but have also added some basic smart-home accessories.  The full size Echo has much better sound quality than the 2nd gen dot, but this 3rd gen dot has noticeably closed the gap!  The sound is fuller overall, especially on the low end, and voice recognition seems just as good.  In addition, the new design looks much better, despite being slightly larger.",0
3,"Oh Alexa, why do you torment me?!
  
",30.Nov.18,Yes,"Setting up the dot was super easy. Getting it to link to an amazon smart plug super easy. Getting Alexa to respond to the commands to control the smart plug was face-slappingly frustrating. Turns out that speaking to my Alexa in my house was controlling the smart plug in my sister's apartment 150 miles away.....that's got to be an accomplishment. Still haven't been able to figure out how to get her to pause or stop or do anything other than play shows and movies on my Amazon Fire TV stick. I'm sure I'll figure it out eventually, but, for now, she doesn't seem very receptive to commands.",0
1,"Difficult to set up
  
",30.Nov.18,Yes,"Whereas the 2nd gen Dot was easy to set up, 3rd gen was a royal pain.  The online PC app is not worth anything to try to set up.  The Fire HD tablet was useless.  Amazon customer service did not help, even after forwarding to Tech Dept.  It took several attempts with the Alexa app on cell phone to finally get it to work.  There is supposed to be an audio improvement, but it is barely noticeable.",2
5,"Box came opened and without any protection inside.
  
",30.Nov.18,Yes,"Box arrived open and without any kind of filling protection for the product. Since it's a gift for someone else, I won't know until Christmas if it works or not. I will update later and change stars if it works... really disappointed so far...Update (12/01/2018): After some issues on my part (family emergency), managed to talk to Kristina. Since it's not in stock and will be back close to Christmas (and the product is a gift for a relative), decided to give it and if it doesn't work, I can return it without hustle. Giving now 3 stars just because I'm not able to test product yet, but customer service was very helpful so far. Will update and change score once the product is tested after the holidays.Update (12/28/2018): My husband set it up, so far is working well and we have no issues with the product (thumbs up).",0
3,"Too much bass for voice
  
",30.Nov.18,Yes,"I have 3 echo's (dot and large one). When I saw the new 3rd generation at a good price I jumped on it.But, the bigger speaker may be better for music but it is hard to understand Alexa's voice when she responds.I set the bass to the lowest and treble to the highest to no avail. It helped some but still TOO MUCH BASS.This is (of course) my opinion but I am disappointed in the new version.",1
5,"Smart little speaker with good sound
  
",30.Nov.18,Yes,Love it.  Straight out of the box it blows the functionality of my apple HomePod out of the water.  Why did I spend $350 on a HomePod when Alexa is so smart. Can make calls on my iPhone when HomePod couldn_.  Decent sound.  Certainly the sound doesn_ compete with HomePod but I_ getting the other echo now for that.  This I use in my office and it is perfectly good sound quality to fill a small room. Get this speaker. Only thing I wish is that it used a usb plug but the plug it has works fine.,0
5,"If you work from home and have conference calls this is a necessity
  
",30.Nov.18,Yes,"I cannot believe it, but this is also an IP Phone, and I used it to dial into work conference calls. This was an amazing surprise because it relieves my cell phone and land line from being used for the conference call. So on top of telling Alexa to wake me up with classical music or hip-hop, and getting the news, and playing music, and controlling whatever else is connected,  I can make phone calls to anywhere, and still use my phones for other calls (I multi-task).",0
4,"Very quick answers
  
",30.Nov.18,Yes,"I got my Echo in the mail and it was fairly easy to set up. I do wish the plug didn't look so beefy. The speaker is great and pretty loud and clear. It's also pretty heavy so you don't feel like it'll accidentally get knocked down by anything.One thing I do not enjoy is the fact quite a few features require a subscription. I really want to listen to my Spotify without needing Premium, but that must be Spotify's decision.",0
2,"Issues with sound quality and atrocious Customer service
  
",1.Dec.18,Yes,"I purchased this on black Friday, the deal was too good to pass up! After completing the setup, which was fairly easy, I discovered the sound to be muffled, distorted, and scratchy, almost as if the something was rattling inside or perhaps a bad speaker.After calling Amazon to explain the sound quality issue, they confirmed that they had been receiving complaints of similar problems.I wanted a replacement, but not a refurbished unit. Amazon also sold out of the charcoal grey. This is where the headaches began. First they wanted to hear the problem over the phone.....really? Telephone sound quality isn't in 16 bit stereo sound, but ok, I'll let them listen to it over the phone. I was told they could only send a refurbished unit or I could return it and simply buy a new one. This is a problem because of the black Friday price. I finally got them to agree to a new unit and keep the old dot until they came back in stock. Came back home only to find that Amazon deregisterd the Device!!!! Called again to have it registered explaining my issues about 5 times with various reps.In short, this 3rd generation dot has known sound quality problems and I believe the replacement will be the same. I'm not looking for astonishing sound from a small and inexpensive smart speaker, but the distortion is very bad, my smartphone has clearer sound!!",25
5,"A great upgrade or additional device!
  
",1.Dec.18,Yes,"I've had the gen 2 for a little over two years.  I have loved it and use it many times a day.  It was great in our old, fairly small apartment.  We just bought a new house with 2 floors and a lot more space.  We needed another one for the additional floor.  I don't need one for every room.  I thought it over, and then seeing the sale price of $24, I decided to get the 3 instead of another 2.I am so glad I did!  I replaced the gen 2 in the living room with the gen 3 and moved the gen 2 to the finished basement.  Out of the box, it looks much nicer than the gen 2.  The initial setup of the gen 3 took a couple of tries, but was fairly simple.  I get better sound recognition from greater distances with the gen 3.  For comparison, in the same spot, the gen 2 would have a hard time hearing me from the kitchen sink, in a large open kitchen/living room space. especially if there was other noise, even if I raised my voice.  The gen 3 can hear me not only from the kitchen sink, but from down the hall at a bedroom door, without me raising my voice.The gen 3 speaker is louder and clearer for basic tasks like timers, adding to lists, and the weather.  While the speaker quality is better than the gen 2, I still use it with a Bluetooth speaker for music and when I get her to read my kindle books to me.  This is my personal preference.Over all I like the gen 3 even better than the gen 2, but I wouldn't buy another gen 3 and ditch my 2 all together.  The gen 2 still serves a great purpose downstairs, though she won't get as much use as she once did.  If I decided to add more in highly visible places, I would probably get another gen 3, just for the look.",2

I have amazon music unlimited so i take full advantage use of the service with Echo device.  The sound quality for music is ok, lacking bass and highs but when i connect to my Bluetooth speaker, it is a music power house.  With this set up, i dont need the Echo full size.  Dot is perfect because of the size and it does everything like the big brother full size Echo. I was able to get an addition Echo Dot 2nd gen cheap and it makes me like my Dot 3rd gen even more.  Dot 3 sounds better, louder, and pick up voice commands easier.What do i use this for in a daily basis?

As expected the sound on the Gen3 Dot is better than the Gen2 but not as good as the Plus but that doesn't matter to me because I've connected it to a pair of floor standing Snell speakers through a Grace Digital Bluetooth amp. Obviously real speakers will beat a tiny speaker by a country mile.My one complaint is about the power connector. Amazon did something inexcusable with the Gen3 speaker, they used a non-standard round power plug instead of USB as they did on the Gen2 Dot and the Plus. What were they thinking? The no reason to use anything but USB for a low power device such as this.",0

",1.Dec.18,Yes,"Impulse Black Friday purchase and really glad I did. Fun, useful and great sound for what it is. Realized that I'd put off considering this because I hated using Siri on my iPhone. Siri never understood commands very well - I'd keep trying for a while and then just give up. Plus the Siri female american voice setting is just irritating. Alexa's voice recognition is amazing. No trouble communicating. Works effortlessly to request music, turn on the light etc. Maybe it's just a personality thing but Alexa and I get along a lot better :). I really see the potential for smart home,  other skills etc. now.",0

I'm sold!!!However, I purchased 2 (my bedroom &amp; Daughters bedroom) our bedrooms are not far away so as she would talk to hers ""Alexa.....turn on my music"" it would also respond in my room lolQuick fix on the app I downloaded to my cell and changed mine to ""Echo"" and hers ""Alexa""No more issues of both dots responding lol",0

Music sounds good through the built in speaker and can connect to external speakers through the 3.5 mm audio out Jack for better sound. Voice recognition is great. The Sandstone color is my preference, but the Charcoal and Heather Gray look nice too. Alexa is as helpful as on the second generation, so if you already have a Gen 2 echo Dot and have it connected to a good sound system, there's no reason to upgrade. Overall, it's a total no brainier especially on sale. Black Friday deal $25!! It's already a bargain at $50.",0
1,"Worse than the first generations
  
",2.Dec.18,Yes,"I got a first gen dot the day it came out and have a second gen dot in most rooms of my house.  I am disappointed that Amazon has made this generation worse in what I believe to be an Apple-like attempt to make it harder to let third parties make improvements.The Good:It is louder.  That's it.  The first two generations very seldom had an issue with being loud enough.The Bad:The speaker has more bass.  This may be good for music, but it makes the voice more difficult to hear.The microphone has a much more difficult time hearing me.  I frequently have to repeat myself for it to hear the wake word despite being in the same location we've had a dot since Gen 1.The wall wort now takes up about three spaces in a power strip.  The first two gens fit nicely in one space.The USB cable has been replaced as the source of electricity with some odd circular plug that is permanently attached to the wall wort.  This means that you can't easily switch the length of the cable.  It will be harder for third parties to make things like the two wall mounts I use.  I don't think any manufacturer will be able to make a tight L-shaped corner for this plug like the kind that are so plentiful for USB.  Not having a USB will also make it more difficult to use in the car.  With Amazon coming out with their own car version of Alexa I believe this was done to stop people from using dots in the car and to force them to buy the new device.The device is bigger than either of the prior generations.  While not huge, the increase in size is noticeable and will make it more difficult to mount or make portable.The device is covered with cloth.  Amazon thinks this is a plus.  I guess some consumers might too.  I think it looks like cheap furniture instead of a sleek piece of electronics.",24
1,"Very Disappointed In The Sound Quality. Muddy, Flat and Muffled
  
",2.Dec.18,Yes,"I watched a video before purchasing the 3rd Gen. The reviewer raved about it's greatly improved sound over the 2nd Gen, which I own. Based on that review I bought the 3rd Gen as part of a package deal with a TP-Link HS105 smart switch.After setting it up I immediately noticed how muddy, flat and muffled the sound is. After a couple of days I was desperate to see if there was anything I could do to improve the sound quality. I found out that the user can adjust the bass, mid-range and treble levels. Plus or minus 6dB is the maximum range. I currently have the bass at -6dB, the mid-range at +3dB and the treble at +6dB. These adjustments helped somewhat but there is no getting around the fact that it still sounds muddy. As one reviewer aptly described it, it sounds like someone put a very thick blanket over it.Here's my preference in sound quality in order of preference: #1 Google Home Mini, #2 2nd Gen Echo Dot, #3 3rd Gen Echo Dot.Three stars off for the terrible sound. One star off for the barrel plug to power it.",11
1,"The entire Echo system has changed for the worst...
  
",2.Dec.18,Yes,"I changed my review from 5 stars to 1 star because of a software update that now forces me to specify which light, power strip, and/or other devices I want to turn on/off. All of my rooms, lights, power strips, etc... are in various groups for a reason. Each light, outlet, and other devices have a unique name (IE: The upstairs hallway lights are named UH-Light, UH-Light2, and UH-Light 3, my smart power strip has unique ports like TV, Monitors, etc..).YESTERDAY (9/18/2019) I was able to walk into a room and say ""Alexa, turn the light on"" (in my home office for example) and it turns the light on, Today (9/19/2019) I'm sitting in my home office and I say ""Alexa turn the light off"" and I get the response ""There are multiple devices that share that name, which one do you want"".The master bedroom - Setup with only lights (MBR-light, or something like that so I can identify it later when adding other stuff), the wife used to say ""Alexa, turn the light off"" because that's what she has always said before going to sleep. Today she can't do that because of Amazon's development team.So I say ""Alexa turn the office light off"" and it turns the ENTIRE OFFICE GROUP OFF. So now I have to go to the app to turn the light off.I reached out to Amazon customer support who tells me I have to be specific when asking the echo to turn the light off as in ""Alexa, turn the office light off/on"" and that it has always been this way. When I tried to tell them that yesterday I was able to say ""Turn the light off"" they said it wasn't possible and I have always had to be specific.I set up groups for a reason, that being I can go into a room, say ""Alexa, turn the light on"" without having to remember each light bulb name or what I named the room/group. Yes, I know what the group names are, I don't expect everyone in my house to remember the group names.There was a software/firmware update overnight that broke all of my Echo's and Amazon's customer support will not acknowledge it.I will not recommend this device to anyone else until they put it back to the way it was.",0
5,"Much improved speaker over 2nd gen
  
",2.Dec.18,Yes,"This is my third Echo device, with me being an owner of a first-gen Echo (almost since the beginning), an Echo show (added a couple years later), and now two of these 3rd-gen Echo Dots. At some point in there, I also tried the 2nd-gen Dot, but I ended up selling that one because I couldn't stand how weak and tin-y the speaker sounded--I wasn't expecting it to be great for music (you can connect external speakers to both that and this generation), but I was expecting it to still be good for alarms/timers and whatnot. Unfortunately, that was not the case for the 2nd gen.Enter the third generation: it's a little bigger, but the speaker is SO much better. It's not quite as good as my full-size Echo for music, but it's impressively good for its size. Unlike the previous generation, it also does produce alarm/timer sounds that sound full and loud, not weak and full of treble only (i.e., if this were my alarm, it would actually wake me up). The power connector also changed to the typical DC ""barrel"" connector over micro USB, presumably to handle the increased power demand of the new speaker (not a problem for me but may be for you if you're hoping to replace a previous gen you had strategically powered).As of the time of my writing, the Dots have also frequently either been on sale or bundled cheaply as a promo with other items. Even at full price, I don't think this is a bad device, but if you find it on sale and are otherwise on the fence, I'd say to try it! I'm pleasantly surprised (so much that I now own two!).",0

",2.Dec.18,Yes,"We've several 2nd generation Echo devices in our house and I decided to order one of the newer models during Black Friday sale. I am amazed at the difference in sound - it's excellent for such a small device at the sale price or the typical price. I hate reading some reviews were people are critical of the sound. It's as if they think they can spend $25-$50 on a device and get the equivalent sound quality of a multi hundred dollar speaker system - be real. It's  much fuller than 2nd gen and the bass is actually noticeable, but it's not a multi hundred dollar speaker. Also, I don't see many speakers of better quality out there capable of controlling smart plugs, set thermostats, play games and give out the news and weather, as well as read out appointments on a calendar, etc.",1
1,"Why should I stay with Echo?
  
",2.Dec.18,Yes,"We have enjoyed all of our Echo devices- 2 Dots &amp; a Spot. It has been wonderful to be able to play Amazon Music on these devices with out ads.  With the removal of Amazon Music I am considering going with Google Home.  Google works with my Hue Lights and can do everything Alexa does &amp; more.Why should I continue with Echo devices- that doesn't have its own Music and can't answer 2/3 of the questions my ""Ok Google"" on my phone can? (And it's not eligible for return. )",2
5,"Amazing Device, you must have one.
  
",2.Dec.18,Yes,"I love the all new Echo Dot, it has a place next to my bed and sings to me nightly. I can ask it to set the alarm and it will. You have to be careful with the mic because Alexa can hear you in another room or even on the other side of the house. A few times when I lost internet connection, Alexa told me she was not feeling well. My first clue that there is something wrong with the internet. Sometimes the answers to the questions can be entertaining. I am sad that you cannot use it to turn on a Fire Stick, but with the Alexa app you can turn on the Fire Stick or Echo Dot with your cell phone. Or even send music to it from the App on the phone, subscription to Amazon Music needed. Sometimes Alexa will start speaking for no reason when the TV is on, I always wonder if it is due to a programmed ad. So if your worried that Alexa will record your conversations, rest assured that it will, even when you are in the other room. There is an on/off button for the mic, but it is just as easy to unplug it if you are worried your conversation will be recorded.",1
5,"An essential device
  
",2.Dec.18,Yes,"As a resident in a retirement community I see many of my friends experiencing age related falls.  When I was advised by friends to get an Echo, my first thought was no, I don't need that, but when a very dear friend fell recently and we weren't sure she'd live, I realized just having a life alert hanging around my neck is not enough. If I were to have a stroke and be paralyzed, I'd not be able to press the life alert button. With Echo Dot, I could just call out for Echo to call the number at the front desk for help (Echo does not dial 911).  Aside from that very practical benefit, it sure is fun to ask Alexa to play my favorite music. Right now I am listening to the Mitch Miller songs I first heard as a child. The list is long as to what can be done, but the greatest value is Alexa can help me if I am in danger here in my apartment.",0
4,"Great but few issues.
  
",2.Dec.18,Yes,This thing is super awesome.  Just what the doctor ordered.  Except the directions are not very clear.  A lot has to be figured out on my own.  And the alexa app is very buggy.  Like the yellow flashing is for notifications and messages.  But how to stop the flashing.  Had to read both notifications and messages.  But app has no notifications section.  Only messages.  And alarm volume is separate in app from regular volume.  And groups do not work.  I had a echo dot in a group.  Then removed it and now when I re add it the group is empty.  It is checked marked but the group still shows empty.  I even deleted that and added a new gruop.  No luck.  Still shows e!my in app.  I even bought a second dot 3 and set it up.  But still not showing in a group.,0
3,"I prefer it's predecessor hands down. It looks nice but it doesn't sound nice.
  
",2.Dec.18,Yes,"Only had it a couple days. Music sounds better than it's predecessor but the Alexa voice is too bassey. Bought it in conjunction with the smart switch for a better price but I think that was a mistake. I say that because whenever I bought this it was $24 plus $5 for a Wi-Fi plug. When I go to return it it says that you cannot return something about a package deal. The other thing is if it's a package deal why don't they ship them together, I got the plug one day and they thought two days later. I would have no problem sending back the plug but when I look at my billing it's supposed to be $24 and $5 and for some reason it turned out to be $19 for the dot and $10 for the plug so I'm going to get raked over the coals when I return it - at least I think so.",0
5,"My 4th, this one goes permenantly into my vintage stereo system. no more stored music
  
",2.Dec.18,Yes,"The Echo system is the greatest source of music for my vintage 1972 McIntosh/JBL  stereo system, restored to original specifications.  Echo provides an unlimited source of full fidelity, clean, music.  It also makes it easy to personalize and mix many selections on digital storage for playing later.  I have found that albums, and tapes are not needed now and are taking up space.  A good multi-band equalizer provides the old ""tube"" sound I have gotten used to, now without the hiss and scratches.  My other Echo devices provide mathematical help in my shop and another one is my multi-function ""alarm clock"".  Even though I do not use a ""smart"" linked system, I find it easy to input information with my home computer.",0
5,"Beautiful Product!
  
",2.Dec.18,Yes,"I love the way this product looks, feels, and functions.Compared to the 2nd generation, the speaker quality clearly outshines it. The volume ""10"" is sooooo much louder compared to the 2nd generation, and also maintains a clarity of sound that leaves you enjoying it.I bought one of these for each of my family members to make it easier for us to keep in touch and stay organized -- if you are thinking about buying one, then I say go for it!",1
5,"Sound Quality Much Better than 2nd Generation!!
  
",2.Dec.18,Yes,I had two Echo Dots 2nd Generation and thought they were pretty good. I also have the Echo but put the dots in various rooms. I saw the 3rd Generation at a great price for Black Friday and couldn't resist and ordered 3 of them. Well let me tell you that the sound quality is far superior than the 2nd Generation. It's also much louder if you like that. Huge difference in over sound quality of music. Set up was simple and  the 3rd Generation can respond to my voice from a much father distance than both my Echo and 2 Generation Dots. I'll of course keep the 3rd Generation for myself and gift the two 2nd Generation Dots I have to family member who do not have any Alexa devices.,0
1,"does nothing right
  
",2.Dec.18,Yes,didn't understand simple commands. I got a lot of I didn't  understand and a lot of MMMMM  it did mange to set an alarm but when i asked her to play beach sounds she stopped talking. The worst part was I asked her for the weather she gave me a report on a town and state i haven't lived in for years! Creepy. I returned it.,2
4,"Blows the 2nd Gen away!
  
",2.Dec.18,Yes,"Amazon literally improved everything, right down to the plug! It sounds so much better than the 2nd Gen did, and even better than the Google home mini. This actually has some low end to the sound. It also looks a lot better, the fabric cover helps it blend into any decor and look much more premium. The plug is also better designed so it more flush with outlet and not sticking out like before. Only downside with the plug is that it can't be powered via USB, since it now uses a proprietary plug. Definitely recommend this over the old one, especially with this being only slightly more expensive at the moment.",0
5,"this is the way to go
  
",2.Dec.18,Yes,"I was using a first generation echo, and was unhappy about the monaural music.  the cost of a 2nd generation echo was equal to two of this product, and still needed a plug in speaker to achieve sterio.  I purchased two of these, paired them, and discarded the echo.  it picked up right where the echo left off with the programming, but added stereo sound.we like to stoke up the fireplace in the middle of the night on a weekend, and play amazon music, with the lights out.  a little hot chocolate, or eggnog completes a memorable evening.  great sound.",0
1,"Worthless
  
",2.Dec.18,Yes,"I received this as a promo on a Ring Doorbell 2 I purchased from a local big box retailer.  Have spent 30 minutes trying to use this as a Bluetooth speaker, and nothing.  I've got 4 other devices in the house that connect to my phone with zero problems, and this piece of shit won't connect.  If I had known this, I would have used it as a stocking stuffer or something but now I'm stuck with it.  Thanks Amazon.",2
1,"NOT WORTH PURCHASING, BUY THE 2ND GEN INSTEAD
  
",3.Dec.18,Yes,"I DO NOT LOVE THE 3RD GEN DOTS.  I LOVE MY AMAZON ECHO DOTS, at least the 2nd Gen Dots.  I have found them to be a wonderful asset.  Easy access to music, audiobooks, to do lists, grocery lists.  They have made my life easier and been helpful to organization.  However I would NEVER AGAIN purchase the 3rd Gen.  I currently have three 2nd Gen.  (Kitchen, Bedroom, Laundry Room)  I was enticed by the ""more powerful, clearer speaker"".  It was on sale in the fall for the same price as a 2nd Gen.  I decided one more, with a better speaker, would be ok for the kitchen and move the kitchen one to the office.  BIG MISTAKE!!!  I feel I can usually trust Amazon, but this speaker is fuzzy, garbled, not NEARLY as good as the others.  I didn't realize I could return it and didn't try until after the window for return had lapsed.  I am VERY DISAPPOINTED  and want to save anyone else from disappointment.  Buy and Echo Dot, just not 3rd GEN!!!",19
1,"Do not buy! Very glitchy
  
",3.Dec.18,Yes,"Omg I wanted to love this since I have the older version but this new dot is really glitchy. It has constant static issues while playing music. Also it does not pick up your voice commands about 90 percent of the time when you're streaming. You have to literally yell at it to get it to respond. The response time also lags compared to the older dot. I bring my dots with me traveling to other countries so don't really have an option to return this in time so I'm really disappointed. Stuck with a faulty bad product. Amazon, you Southold have better quality control in place.",18
2,"Bass-Heavy Audio Frequency Characteristics and Limited Adjustability for Voice / Audiobooks
  
",3.Dec.18,Yes,"Bought this as an adjunct to the text-to-voice feature on my Amazon Fire / Kindle, which I used all the time to listen to content when I don't have time to sit and read.  I have to say that the audio for this 3rd-generation Dot just isn't good.  It's too resonant in the bass / low midrange, even when those values are minimized using the Alexa app.  That app gives you three frequency ranges for adjustment--bass, midrange, and treble--which should be adequate.  The problem is that the Dot speaker(s) and the shell of the device itself, naturally overemphasize bass and lower midrange.  For my listening (mostly to spoken word, not music), that's not at all good--I need the higher frequencies to come through crisply, and to greatly attentuate the lower frequencies (at which spoken voice sounds muddy, indistinct, and slurred).  I'll send this one back and maybe try again when Amazon has done a better job of configuring the shell to null out the inappropriately enhanced ranges.",10
4,"Stereo pairing feature incomplete, otherwise a good device
  
",3.Dec.18,Yes,"The sound is definitely improved over previous generations, and is downright good at this point.  The SmartThings integration is likewise very good - I can control pretty much everything through Alexa, and the setup was easy and well documented._omputer, turn off the living room and off go the lights, TV and Christmas tree.  Brilliant.The grouping is excellent - whole home audio is here, and it_ great.  (Drawback of stereo feature below also applies here, though.). Just make sure the Dots are in Bluetooth range of each other.I_ disappointed in the stereo pairing though, and this could be a deal breaker for you.  So first, it sounds great, when it works.  Amazon and streaming content sound so much better with stereo pairing.  Synchronization is perfect, and this really adds to the experience.  BUT, it seems you cannot use stereo pairing with a Bluetooth connected audio source.  Do you want to use stereo Echo Dots as your Bluetooth computer speakers?  Nope.  The sound only comes through one Dot, and the Bluetooth connection between dots is severed until you disconnect the Bluetooth audio source. Do you want to stream from a smartphone or tablet via Bluetooth and listen in stereo using 2 Dots?  Not gonna work (in stereo) at the time of writing this review.To me, this oversight/compromise almost makes it a 3 star device.  I am giving it 4 as the whole home audio is quite nice, and Alexa is at the top of digital assistants in my opinion.  But the stereo implementation isn_ compete.One other negative is latency when used as a speaker for Fire TV 4K.  I love my new fire TV 4K. I purchased it in a bundle with the 3rd generation Echo Dot. However, the two barely function together.  The audio latency is well over half a second, so the picture is totally out of sync with the audio.  Big drawback.In summary, use your Echo Dot as a mini smart home assistant. It sounds great, and functions very well as a smart home assistant.  The whole home audio feature is great so far.  _omputer, play Christmas music downstairs and it_ an instant winter wonderland in here.  But I would not recommend attempting to use this as a Bluetooth speaker for a video device due to the latency issues.  Likewise, be aware of the limitations with stereo pairing.",4
2,"Sound is not as clear as the 2nd Gen Dot
  
",3.Dec.18,Yes,"I have several 2nd generation Echo dots and recently received this 3rd generation one. I switched out one of the others for this new one and immediately noticed a different in the sound, and not in a good way. No matter how I adjust the bass or treble, it sounds hollow and much less clear than the earlier generation. I listen to Audible books and music every day and immediately heard the difference with the 3rd Gen dot. This was received ""free"" as part of a package with another order, so I can't return it for a refund, and I feel like a replacement would do the same, so it will definitely be going out to the shop, where it will be rarely used. Pros: It looks gorgeous and very modern. Cons: Sound is much less clear.",3
4,"It's basically a sexier looking gen 2 with marginally better sound
  
",3.Dec.18,Yes,"I'm just going to get straight to it and give you some important pros and cons. However, if you don't want to read my entire review, when considering all my thoughts on Gen 3 Dot, I still absolutely recommend everyone own one.Pros:- Setup start to finish, out of the box to ready is less than 3 minutes.- Gen 3 looks substantially nicer then Gen 2.- The speaker is improved from Gen 2. With that said, the bass is still laughable. However mids and highs are much improved and push well rather than screeching at high volume.- If you actually explore the vast skills Alexa can do and what Dot excels at, this unit can do a great deal and absolutely be useful from day to day. From updates on Amazon orders, to ordering from Dot, to playing music, or setting an alarm and then having Alexa tell you about your day, this unit can do a great deal and do it well.There are many more pros but nobody wants to read a novel so I chose what's most important.Cons:- When you set this up, if you do it on your phone, you need to exercise caution doing so if you don't want Alexa to have your entire contact list. If you give that permission, your entire list will be in the cloud. Just a heads up.- Alexa can make calls with Gen 3 Dot, and the process is flawless. However, if you actually expect to have a conversation with someone, you had better turn the volume up very near max, or they will not hear you. Also, there is lag between parties on the call and I've verified that a half dozen times.- Alexa still struggles with certain words, phrases, obscure songs, and questions, if you don't word them in specific manners. Given, as you use your Dot, Alexa will adjust to you and get better, but it can be frustrating even for someone like me who's a technology freak.- Alexa often mistakes you when you say to adjust sound down and instead adjusts it up. This fades after you've said the phrase a dozen or so times.As with the pros, I could go on and on, but nobody wants to read a novel so I picked the most important factors to help you make an informed decision.Look, in many ways, for many people, Alexa products, specifically Dot, are used mostly as toys. A lot of people play with them a few weeks or months and gradually give up on them. Why? Usually, because they lack patience working through the kinks in the interface and also because they simply never explore the thousands of skills this can perform.So my question to you is do you consider this a fun toy or do you consider it an exciting technology with a lot to offer? If you consider it a toy, just save a few bucks and buy a used Gen 2 used, for under $20. If you consider it a useful technology and plan to seriously explore its possibilities, I absolutely recommend this as a way to get your feet wet or to add to your Alexa connected devices. Yes, this is still a technology with a long way to go, but it's worth owning and growing with!Cheers!",1
5,"Affordable way to try home automation, works as a personal assistant
  
",3.Dec.18,Yes,"This is my first foray into this type of technology, I got it as a Black Friday special bundle with a sengled smart light kit, so I have no comparison. It has a sleeker domed edge and rounded top which makes it look higher quality out the box than the previous hockey puck style version. It was a straightforward setup along with connecting it to the smart lighting, coming from someone who didn't grow up with technology. It's nice when I come home at night to turn the lights on by voice instead of fumbling across the room to the light switch, as well as remotely control my lights for security reasons, and get my flash briefing while I'm having my morning coffee, and do other simple tasks by voice via skills you can add, you can link various apps to it like Pandora and list.me, make phone calls, schedule, set alarms, use multiple units as a home intercom system, as well as skills templates where you can make your own skill if you're feeling industrious. The speaker is plenty loud for my small space (900sq ft total), but there is some distortion to music at higher volumes, which, for me, is to be expected for something so little (about 4 1/2 to 5 inch across). I keep it In my kitchen, it can hear me from my bedroom down a 15 foot hallway if I have the door open, and not if the door is closed (I'm fine with that as I dont really want a potentially open mic in my bedroom or bathroom). For the cost it was an affordable foray into home automation for me.",0
5,"Worth the upgrade!
  
",3.Dec.18,Yes,"I wasn_ really planning on upgrading from my second generation to this third-generation dot  until I came across the cyber week special bundle with a smart light kit.  The sound, look, &amp; _oot of the new version make this better than the last one.Overall, I was very happy with  my second generation., using it to play music, listen to the news, and hear the occasional joke.  I understood that if I wanted to hear decent sound, I had to connected to my Bluetooth speaker.Enter third-generation dot: As you can hear from the video, music sounds much better, with a bump of bass  without  needing an external Bluetooth speaker. The gray fabric looks very classy with any decor.  Also, the foot is much grippier than the second generation one,  so even though the new version is heftier, it moves less. Overall, highly recommended!",2
4,"Awesome Little Device for the Mula!
  
",3.Dec.18,Yes,"The Amazon Echo is a great little device the money. It has so many different skills and things you can do with it.My favorite being able to set commands as you wish so for example when I say ""Alexa, Good Morning"", It'll say goodmorning, tell me the weather and raise my living room lights to 50%.There are tons of games you can play with it like jeopardy, Bingo, Ect.It can tell you jokes, but it triggers Jimmy fallon to tell a joke which is neat.The only disappointing thing i thought about it was the sound quality of the speaker. Now i'm not going to make a big deal from it since you can connect it through bluetooth or aux cord to any speaker in the world and it was only $25 when i got it so i wasn't expecting much.But overall the device is very useful to controlling your smart home, other devices with smart plugs, or just having a general conversation with it when you're lonely i have noone to talk to, (insert tear emoji here).",0

Also, design of Dot 3 is very nice, heavier and sturdier hardware wise and look s and feels well-made.  I have 2 Dot 2's currently and the sound improvement was what I was looking for.  But the new design is great and things like setup have been improved greatly.  After you start up the Dot 3 and get the welcome message simply fire up the Alexa app and go into Devices -- Add Device then go thru and simply setup the Dot 3.

",4.Dec.18,Yes,"I have 2 original echo dots, a first gen Echo and a second gen Echo and this is by far the worst. The microphone pickups are terrible. When I asked Alexa a question to this 3rd gen dot from 8 feet away it does not hear the question, yet the 2nd gen Echo in a bedroom with the door closed can hear me and does answer? This Dot replaced the 1st gen Echo that was placed 20 feet away in the kitchen and had no problem hearing and responding.Did the race to the bottom on costs lead to cheaper inferior microphones? I see there are only four on this one.",6

During set up it tries to connect to a secure network without even asking for the password. The result is that it can not connect. After trying multiple times to connect I contacted Amazone support. They could not get it to connect either. This 3rd gen is going back to Amazon, very disappointing. Any device should ask for a password when connecting to a secure network but this one does not.",3

",4.Dec.18,Yes,I have two 2nd generation echo Dots that I love and use daily. I decided to buy the 3rd generation as I got it for a great price on Black Friday on Kohls.comI'm not disappointed!! Love the new speaker. So much better than the second generation.Easy set up with the app just like the 2nd  generation. This is slightly bigger in size than the 2nd generation and uses a different power cord.I wish I had this version in all my rooms!Update: just added a second third generation. Love it over the second gen and since we're moving to a bigger house I need two on each floor. My husband and I use our dots constantly.,1
5,"The best Dot yet
  
",4.Dec.18,Yes,"I've been a fan of the Dot since the first generation, and they really nailed it with this one. I don't know how they did it, but the sound quality from this is incredible for the size. Much better bass, and that's noticeable even if just talking to Alexa: her voice is much easier to hear and understand on this speaker than the prior versions.In addition to the improvements in sound, this speaker looks great, and has a nice round shape and soft fabric sides.Amazon did a great job with the hardware, and the software/AI has always been best in class. What sets Amazon apart from other products in this space is the huge array of third-party devices and services that Alexa can connect to. Having an always around AI isn't very useful if it can't do anything, and nobody's AI can do as much as Alexa.",0
5,"Great upgrade over the 2nd generation dot
  
",4.Dec.18,Yes,"The 2nd generation dot found itself in a bad spot once the google home mini came out. The google mini had superior sound quality, making it a far better option for playing music. This generation solves that problem with gusto. The sound is robust for a speaker of this size, and it can get loud. I have yet to turn the volume up past 50% and it more than fills my living room (your experience may differ based on room size). In addition, the 3rd gen has a great look to it with the soft speaker cover material around the edge.",1
2,"Not worth having more than one unless u like to spend more money
  
",4.Dec.18,Yes,Nothing like the amazon echo regular this one is stuck on stupid. Asked over 10 simple questions and can not get an answer. Also its not able to play music while another device is streaming music. All this technology and i need to pay for more services. Upgrade to a family plan or so. I already pay enough for prime service plus the cost of a large one and then the dot plus smart light bulbs and now spend more money so 2 devices can stream. What a disappointment,1

",4.Dec.18,Yes,"Bought this for my son's bedroom. Opened it, synced it to my echo system and it sounds amazing for the size and price. The Echo 2 sounds better but it's more than twice the price. If you're on a budget for an Echo device, this is for you.Compared to the Echo Dot 2, this new version blows those out of the water. Good bass response, louder, better mids.

",4.Dec.18,Yes,"I got the echo dot as a birthday present and so far, ti's pretty good.  The only problem is when I'm asking it to play music, half the time it says it's doesn't understand, but I can use the app to play the song I want, so it's an easy issue to get around.What I don't like is when it suddenly activates itself and suddenly just says, ""hmmm, I don't know that."".  Scares the hell out of me!Overall, since I'm still playing with it and getting used to it, I'll give it a four.  There are still some problems, but I don't find them to be a deal breaker.",0

The reminders also go to my phone if I'm not home.TMy only complaint is that when we tried using it to make a phone call my dad couldn't hear us but that could be call receiver error ;),0
5,"It's Fun -- and Helpful.
  
",4.Dec.18,Yes,I have bought a couple of 2nd Gen Echo Dots and really enjoyed them. It was therefore a no-brainer to buy the 3rd Gen given the insignificant price difference between the two.The main difference between the two is the better speaker on the 3rd Gen Dot.  I therefore use this new Dot in a bedroom where it can act as a speaker. My original Dot is synched to a Sonos speaker.Once you start off on a smart home journey you begin to discover the myriad of ways that an Echo Dot can help with household tasks.,0
2,"The 3rd Gen Dot buzzes when ""silent""
  
",5.Dec.18,Yes,"Received the Gen 3 Dot today, set it up, and tried it out.  My experience up to this point has been with a Gen 1 Dot have had on my nightstand for years and recently a Gen 2 Dot.  The Gen 3 is the worst of the three, but first a little base-lining.You primarily buy an Echo Dot if you plan on attaching speakers whether wired or wireless.  If you plan to use the device standalone with even an inkling of playing music, then you should go with one of the larger Echos and not the Dots as regardless of the Dot, the sound isn't going to be good.  Dots = external speakers or news, full-size Echos = everything.The worst thing I've found with the Gen 3 that the other two generations didn't have is a buzzing when turned off (not playing anything).  There's a buzzing through the speakers.  Thing is, I also bought a Gen 2 Echo and it does the same thing.  There's a buzzing, even when the volume is low, coming through the speakers regardless of whether the speakers are external or internal.  it's something inherent to the latest devices/hardware.  it's terribly annoying and I can only assume something is wrong with the devices.  As mentioned, neither the Gen 1 or Gen 2 devices have this problem.The buzzing is annoying as heck and the only way to ""stop"" it is to either play something or turn the volume down low on the external speaker, but then everything is lower.  To stop the buzzing, I turned down my speakers so that what now must play at a Volume 5 on the Gen 3 Dot is equal to what the Gen 1/2 did at Volume 2.  When it comes to the full-size Echo, there's nothing you can do.  It just buzzes even when at a low volume.The other thing I've noticed is that the Gen 1 and Gen 2 were far more sensitive and responsive than the Gen 3 Dot.  I could speak at what I consider a normal volume regardless of what was playing and the Gen 1/2 heard me.  Not so for the Gen 3.  i also have to slow down to let the Gen 3 Alexa catch up to what I'm saying which wasn't a problem with the Gen1/2.I can only assume that there's just something wrong with the device.  I may give it another day or two in the event a patch was released, but at this time, the device seems defective because of the buzzing.",0
1,"This is the most useless electronic toy I've ever purchased.
  
",5.Dec.18,Yes,"There was a lot of hype about the Echo Dot. So I thought I would buy one to try it out.  First of all, it didn't recognize most commands I gave it. Second, it couldn't ever figure out the correct audio device to stream to. Third, the software interface is awful.  If you ask it to play a certain album, the interface didn't show you the list of songs in the album and what was coming up next. Fourth, if I told Alexa to launch a program on my Windows PC, it didn't ever work, which I would have expected to be one of the first features to be implemented in a device like this.  Everything this device can do, I can do better by just using my keyboard, mouse, and touchscreen.",1
5,"Great upgrade to 2nd gen!
  
",5.Dec.18,Yes,"I already love my Echo 2nd gen. I knew I wanted another Echo. I was torn on buying the taller one or the 3rd gen cause what I wanted most out of a second one was better audio quality. I have a set of logitech computer speakers with a sub hooked to my 2nd gen and that makes a big difference, but this 3rd gen went in my small back room where I did not want to have to hook up another set of speakers to her. I've been listening to music on the 3rd gen since I got it and it's perfect, an incredible upgrade in audio quality since 2nd gen and honestly sounds amazing for how little it is. The logitech speakers with the sub still sound better, but this doesn't sound bad at all. I didn't expect it to sound better than my other setup. I also love that I can now group the two units and sync the music between rooms.Oh, I got this around Thanksgiving/Cyber Monday 2018 and the 2nd gen and 3rd gen were only a $5 price difference so it was a no brainer to try the upgraded model imho",0

",5.Dec.18,Yes,"I love my new Echo dot. I enjoy all the skills and the fact I can control lights and my box fan I run through the night with this device. The drop in feature is neat to talk to another room as well. I will say while playing music, the speaker has messed up a couple times to where the music sounds like a scratched up CD and even her voice is the same. If the issue persists, I will exchange for a new device. It happens randomly while playing music on occasion and giving her a break seems to fix the issue or changing the volume after giving her a break helps. She has also already spoken without being ""called upon"" one time. It was creepy, but I shrugged it off. Alexa is part of the family now and she has so many skills on the app store to utilize!",0

Can do multi room music which saved me a ton of money over buying more expensive speakers like Sonos. The speaker quality is what you would expect for the price, Bass is okay but high tones crackle. The Alexa app has an equalizer built in so you can adjust each Dot_ mid and bass levels. The mic does okay at picking up your voice but if the music is too loud you have to yell _LEXA, ALEXAAA, DAMMMIIIITTTTT ALEXA and eventually she will respond. Alexa is not as smart as the google version. Hopefully more updates and she will do better. Overall for the price I paid I_ satisfied.",0
5,"Eats Gen 2 Echo for brunch, it's no full-sized Echo (and that's ok)
  
",5.Dec.18,Yes,"Is this as good as the full sized Echo? No. The full sized Echo has a significantly deeper sound and notable bass. It's not bad, and a great value for the money (I got the Gen 2 Echo Dot when it was $50), but if you want to blast music and feel it, this is not for you.However, if you're not sure what to get and don't want to outlay $70-100, get this guy. You will not regret it.The previous Echo Dot was very tinny and could not fill a larger room with sound. It would probably work for a small room like a bedroom, but obviously, the idea that Jeff B. is listening in makes that less palatable for many people. The new Echo Dot is probably ideal for a kitchen, office or smaller living room - anything larger needs the full-size Echo to act as a small stereo.We now have 4 Echo devices throughout our house and a group so music can play throughout (also can do announcements for the kids to ignore ""Dinner's Ready"").Final thoughts: Don't get the Gen 2. It's worth the extra $5-10 to get the better Dot",0
5,"3rd Generation Better than the Previous Dot
  
",5.Dec.18,Yes,"I am really impressed with the sound on the new 3rd generation that sounds fuller. I had a problem connecting to dot  with Wi-Fi using the Alexa app on the Amazon tablet and had to download the app on my phone.  Setup worked great after changing the Wi-Fi to Amazon-HCO temporary on the phone  as instructed in the Alexa app for the Wi-Fi setup. I am going to miss the USB option for powering the new dot, but the jack connector works fine.UpdateI have purchased my 4th Echo Dot 3rd generation and have no complaints.Update 12/19I have purchased another Echo Dot 3rd generation. Works great and was thinking about trying out the Alexa Guard with the Echo Dot.",0
5,"Impressed
  
",5.Dec.18,Yes,"I heard so much flack about the Echo Dot and having a horrible speaker but at $24 for the holiday sale, I couldn't pass up the opportunity. I bought it.... I was surprised at how good it sounded. Granted I had nothing to compare it to. I bought another one because I was impressed. A few days after having bought it, it still sounds fine and my opinion hasn't wavered.... much. I bought an echo plus and sadly the bass from that thing makes the echo dot sound not so good. Hahaha, so that opinion is a bit biased.",0
4,"Bang for the buck speaker
  
",5.Dec.18,Yes,"I purchased this echo dot after I used echo plus for a few days. We put echo dot beside our night stand so that we do really need to yell in order to get the echo plus that is in our living room to respond. Echo dot pretty much does almost everything that the plus can do from my stand point of view. We really enjoy what the echo dot can do for us. The only weakness that I would like to point out compared to echo plus is its sound quality. If you really would like to use the speaker for music, I would suggest an echo plus or even higher end echo products.",0
5,"Good stand-alone BT speakers! HUGE SOUND IMPROVEMENTS OVER 2ND GEN.  But Alexa's not for everyone.
  
",6.Dec.18,Yes,"While this is a great Bluetooth speaker and overall I love using this device to play Amazon music unlimited and for the occasional Wikipedia reference, I'll be the first to admit that ALEXA STILL HAS A LONG WAY TO GO TO CATCH UP TO GOOGLE ASSISTANT IN TERMS OF EASE OF USE AND CONVERSATIONAL SKILLS, PLUS ACCESSIBILITY OF INFORMATION.  When it comes to what is the better speaker this or the Google home mini, this wins hands down.  I can say that confidently because I have both.  What is the better device?  Well that depends on you.  And which company's services do you have, if either of theirs?  Personally I have both Google play music and Amazon Prime account and additionally I have an Amazon music unlimited account - BUT I only have the Amazon music unlimited account because I have the devices that use it, but the side benefit now is that I get to use it on my phone through the Alexa app and through the Amazon music app.  Before I was strictly using Google play music, which was sufficient but sucked on the voice control side comparatively, at least by phone.  Anyways with both companies' services being paid for, it makes a straight-up comparison of the Google Home vs Amazon Echo easy and for the Google Home Mini vs the Amazon Echo THIRD GEN, the comparison is REALLY EASY.  THIS IS A BETTER DEVICE THAN THE GOOGLE HOME MINI IF YOU KNOW HOW TO USE IT, ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE ALREADY A PRIME MEMBER, AND REALLY THE CASE IF YOU PAY FOR AMAZON MUSIC UNLIMITED WHICH YOU CAN PAY FOR EVEN IF YOU AREN'T A PRIME MEMBER.  My aunt still I think summed it up best when she told me one day, ""Alexa or Amazon devices are the best for Entertainment [AND SOUND QUALITY, AS IS, COMPARATIVELY] but Google devices are better at getting information [i.e. question-answering using natural language]"".  But the sound difference between the 3rd generation dot and the 2nd generation dot is TREMENDOUSLY NOTICABLE to me.  Every second generation Echo dot in my house has a additional speaker attached to it, but neither of the two 3rd generation dots, I feel, require an additional speaker - for adequate sound volume w/o loss of clarity.  Remember if you want a search engine, choose Google.  If you want Alexa's features, then these are currently my recommendation for the best value device for that. Plz see attached videos for more of what I mean and for demonstrated points.",0
3,"Good Devicel, but STOP FORCING STUFF ON US
  
",6.Dec.18,Yes,"I love my echo dot.  But to be woken up in the night by a mysterious green flashing light that won't go off...  Alexa has no answers and doesn't respond to ""turn that flashing green light off"".  So you have to research it on the internet, and find out that it's a notification light, but you don't have Alexa connected to your phone, so what the &amp;%#$ is it notifying you about?  And Alexa doesn't have any notifications for you. So you have to go to the app and go through every menu until you find DO NOT DISTURB, and that's the only way to shut the &amp;%$# flashing light off in the middle of the night.  STOP FORCING ENGAGEMENT ON US, AND LET US USE DEVICES THE WAY THAT WE WANT TO!!!  And don't wake me up in the middle of the night with this nonsense.  Shame on you Amazon.",1
4,"Playing Music
  
",6.Dec.18,Yes,"I have had my Dots for a few days. The main reason I bought 2 was so I could listen to music and have it play in multiple rooms. I only use Pandora because I already have all my stations set and it's easy to add or remove stations. But setting up the Pandora in the Dot was a pain. And Alexa doesn't respond well to voice when asking to play Pandora music. A lot of the times she says she cannot find the music, so I've been turning on through the App..but often times it will pause in the middle of a song so I  have to go into the App and un-pause it. It's a pain, and I hear others are having an issue with Pandora as well.",2
4,"It's a better DOT...
  
",6.Dec.18,Yes,"What I like most about the Echo Dot 3rd Edition is once you have the first Echo Dot up and running the new dots configure WiFi automatically so all I have to do is setup name, wake up command etc...  They say the sound is better in the third generation dot but that is subjective. The third generation has more base but it can make listening to voice difficult. I find my older dots are better for listening to podcasts and voice driven content because they have less bass so i suggest the ad an equalizer function in the Alexa software.... Of course if you plug in your Echo Dot into external speakers or Bluetooth speakers it sounds great. The new fabric shell is very nice but the lite color is much more susceptible to getting dirty.UPDATE: I found an audio equalizer  built into the Alexa phone app and now I can manipulate the sound to accentuate voices and manipulate the sound qualities of the Dot. Much Better!What i really like is telling Alexa to play music ""Everywhere"" and when I walk thru the house I hear my music. Also, you can say ""Alexa, volume , everywhere (or whatever level you want) and the volume goes to that level on all your devices. So cool.This IS a BETTER DOT.....",0
4,"Love the New Look and overall build quality. Not sure about the Speaker upgrade.
  
",6.Dec.18,Yes,"I have two Echo Dot's (2nd Gen) and decided to upgrade to the newest Echo Dot (3rd Gen) mainly because I like the new design and was hoping for a better sounding speaker. My comments regarding the sound are it's not necessarily better sounding but DIFFERENT sounding. The best way to compare the 2nd Gen vs. 3rd Gen is the newer one has more bass or richer sound quality. It also seems to have a lot LESS high end or treble to it's overall sound quality. If you like a bit more bass and don't mind a lesser bright sounding speaker, get the new one. To me, the newer one sounds a bit muffled because of the new speaker. It produces more volume than the older one, but for my taste, I also like a clearer brighter sound. Of course it pairs with most remote bluetooth speakers for much better sound than the unit can produce on it's own. I have experimented listening to all types of music and even talk radio and again, if you like a bit more fuller base sound, you should enjoy the newest version of the Echo Dot. I enjoy the new version and overall recommend the upgrade.",0
5,"Didn't know i needed this until I got it
  
",6.Dec.18,Yes,I stepped up my Christmas light game this year and decided I wanted to be able to control different lights are inflatables and not have to manually unplug them. So I decided I would get some smart plugs and when I went down that rabbit hole I wanted to add an Echo to control them. Really I've been looking for an excuse to buy one since they came out and this was it. Setting up the echo was relatively easy as was adding devices to it. After setting it up I left some post it notes to my wife telling her some things to ask it. I received a text at work telling me how much she loved it. I guess it's a hit,1
5,"3rd Gen Echo Dot Rocks!!!
  
",6.Dec.18,Yes,"OMG!!!!CONGRATULATIONS R&amp;D TEAM!!!The 3rd Generation Echo Dot is the Best one yet!!!Don't Change Anything!!!I replaced my 1st generation Echo Dot I put in our Bathroom because I didn't like the sound quality that it had...so in a small bathroom it was ok...But Now..after replacing it with the new 3rd generation Echo Dot it is giving my first and second generation Echoes a run for the money!!!!The 3rd Gen Echo Dot has a greatly improved sound to it and I Don't have to turn the volume all the way up like I did before with the first gen Dot, which distorted the sound...The sound quality is just as good, if not better than the 2nd Gen Echoes full size ones!!!Thank you Amazon!!!We now have Six of the Echoes in our home which makes an Awesome Surround sound system throughout our home by using the Multi-room feature...Two Thumbs Way up!!!",0
2,"Frequent disconnects.  Marginally better sound than previous Dot.
  
",6.Dec.18,Yes,"I got this because the music sound quality on the previous Dot is sub par.  It's a little fuller on this one but it's still not up to my standards.  I can listen to it though I wouldn't use it at parties.  I get it.  They want you to buy their bigger speaker. My go-to speaker is my Sonos 1, I'm just getting tired of saying ""Alexa, play..........In the Den"".There are differences in what this Dot will understand, vs. my previous Dot.  Not sure what that is about.Biggest complaint is that this thing seems to bug out.  A lot.  I constantly get the red ring followed by ""I'm having trouble understanding"". After an unplug/replug it seems to work fine.  Sometimes not.",0
4,"Is there an echo in here
  
",6.Dec.18,Yes,"Never thought I would actually get one of these considering the big brother aspect of it , but I really like it. I love getting up in the morning asking what the weather is going to be , put on one of the podcasts I like in the morning, reading audible . Haven't got the lights hooked up yet as they haven't been delivered but that's what I actually got this for . I would've given it five stars if it wasn't for set up . Here's my hint for set up if you're trying to put it on your tablet and you're having problems. If you have a laptop or a computer go set it up through your computer or laptop at the Alexa.Amazon.com site, it'll finally work and you'll be online .",0
3,"Big disappointment, no USB!?
  
",6.Dec.18,Yes,"Taller and fatter than original dot.  And what?!  No USB!!!  Wasn't expecting that!  15 watt brick with single purpose, hard-wired, dedicated output connector.  Bigger speaker may give a bit more volume but sound seems a bit muffled.  Maybe more bass but less treble.  Please don't stop producing gen2!  Surprisingly the new fat unit with its fat brick draws slightly less current on standby than the gen 2 with USB but a bit more current when active.  But it stays noticeably warmer than the older version.  Will stick with gen 2 as long as it is available.  If I need richer sound I can connect with BT speaker(s).",0
1,"Just another revenue stream for Amazon
  
",6.Dec.18,Yes,"We purchased multiple echos (4) and are just as quickly returning all of them.  We primarily wanted them for music, not to have Alexa mind our business.  In order to play different music on different Echoes you have to purchase the family plan for another $150.00+ per year or deal with their generic music.  We might have been open the individual music family plan but more than that NO WAY!  Time to say NO to Amazon and being ripped off!!!",1
5,"Love this new Dot!_
  
",6.Dec.18,Yes,My biggest complaint about the Dot 2 (my first)) straight out of the box was the sound quality.  I was hugely disappointed to find out that unless you hooked up external speakers you could barely hear it across the room. This newest Dot has no problem being heard across the house. It also combine some of the features from the kids dot and The previous models allowing you to only have one type of unit throughout the house. We now have several of these with the Amazon music service which the kids love and I am very impressed with not only the quality but the price point as well. Nice job Amazon!,0
5,"Make sure systems are fully compatible.some say they are but you LOSE functions.
  
",6.Dec.18,Yes,"Still customizing and intragrating  with other house smart systems. All working good together. When finished I will truly have a smart home. The best feature with alexa for me is the ability to control everything in any room by talking to house. Got rid of light switches, soon all keys. Don't even have to turn security system on and off, heat ,camera's, others all automatic with geofencing. To many other automatons to list. Will soon be able to see who's at the door tell them to go away or unlock door turn alarm off, light on, heat up and invite in no matter where in the world I am.",0
2,"I like the 2nd generation better
  
",6.Dec.18,Yes,"This 3rd generation Echo Dot has so much bass that it distorts the sound and makes it unpleasant to listen to.  You can adjust the bass/treble (just tell it to lower bass/increase treble, over and over, until Alexa tells you the bass is at its lowest or treble is at its highest), but it's not enough to make it nice to listen to.  I much prefer the 2nd generation.  And this 3rd generation is bigger and much heavier.  I have no idea why this may be an upgrade from 2nd gen.  I'll wait for another sale on the 2nd gen.  I wouldn't buy another 3rd gen.",0
4,"Minor upgrade and better speakers.
  
",6.Dec.18,Yes,"This is a minor upgrade from the 2nd Gen. The speakers are louder with a more pronounced bass. Well enough for use on the loft office for downtime movies. I moved my 2nd gen to the guest room. My gripe is the plug, it_ massive. There would be cases that you can_ plug two devices side to side if using an extension power cord. Also the plug doesn_ have that optional USB detach cable anymore. I plug my 2nd Gen via USB on a 5 port. But the power needs directly to an outlet. Design is certainly better leaving the Amazon logo out.",0
4,"No Amazon Unlimited Music for paired 3rd generation Echo Dots.
  
",6.Dec.18,Yes,I bought two.No Amazon Unlimited Music for paired 3rd generation Echo Dots.It's not supported!I will keep the second one I bought only because I got it on sale at abouthalf the usual price. I'll keep it in the kitchen for use as a timer andweather reports.It is an improvement over the 2nd generation Dot with dramaticallyfuller sound. Doesn't look or feel cheap like its predecessor.I does NOT do what I wanted: play Amazon Unlimited Music in paired (stereo) mode.,0
5,"Anything 3rd Gen is worth the upgrade.
  
",6.Dec.18,Yes,"No doubt the speaker and the mic have been upgraded.  I have at least 1 of every generation echo device. This 3rd gen is noticeably better.  The music sounds great and she is much more responsive.  They do need to add a couple more names to the list to get Alexa_ attention.  Th reason being Alexa is available in more and more devices that you can end up with multiple devices in the same room or proximity.  The better mics also are a reason to have more than 3 possible names which are Alexa, Computer and Echo.",0
4,"Useful, enjoyable product
  
",6.Dec.18,Yes,"I've had Alexa about a week now. I placed the unit in my kitchen and have found a variety of uses for her/it, mainly centred around cooking - on the fly I have Alexa convert measurement units, set multiple timers for different cooking times (last night I was baking some ingredients in the oven while others were frying on the stove), add items to my grocery list, and in the morning I have her play the news from my home country (from Canada, I live in the US) while I make coffee.I don't regret buying the unit at a discounted price, and I'm strongly considering ordering another one when it goes back on sale. Note, I do *not* have any smart devices that she can interact with, other than my phone, and thus someone with more technology may get more use out of her than I do.",0
5,"love it - why did I wait so long?
  
",6.Dec.18,Yes,"While I really, really, really wish there was a way I could play songs/playlists from my iTunes library, I do love how easy it is to request songs of Alexa or play playlists from Amazon Prime Music. Music is much more a part of my day now. I come in the door with my groceries and request a song while I'm putting them away. Washing dishes? Request songs. Also ask for alarms to be set. Still discovering what all Alexa can do. A fun toy, and what a deal at $24 on Cyber Friday.",0
3,"works well, if you can connect
  
",6.Dec.18,Yes,"Got the first one free with another purchase.  Hooked it up and it worked fine.  Bought a couple more, hooked them up. No problem.  Changed wifi routers and all heck broke loose.  Took hours with tech support to get them working.  Then, a couple of days ago, one of them arbitrarily changed wife networks and now won't play music or radio.  Tried to switch it back but following the instructions didn't help.  It is a good product but they have some bugs to work out.  It has been good for my aging mom to use to call us in the night.  Will keep them and try to work out the kinks.  When they work, they work well.",0
1,"Disappointed
  
",6.Dec.18,Yes,This is the first disapppointment we have had with an Amazon device. We could not get the Echo to work properly.  After spending too long with customer support my husband finally got the help person to acknowledge our device was defective and we returned it.We could not get it to sync with our smart plugs and we never got Alexa respond to our requests.,1
5,"Bought one....then 7 more...
  
",7.Dec.18,Yes,"I originally got this echo for free during the Amazon Black Friday deals (Buy a Tile tracker and get an echo free). I had never before been interested in getting an echo as I felt like I_ never use it, but boy was a wrong. Having an echo in your house can really simplify your life. It_ so easy to use too, just downloading the Alexa app on the App Store is all you need. Whenever I go to bed I say _lexa goodnight  and  she turns my lights off, sets my alarms and turns on my white noise machine. Getting accessories for her to use is relatively inexpensive too if you know where to look. I do not have the money to have a _mart house, but for $10 at Walmart you can get both smart plugs and smart screw in light bulbs that work with Alexa. She also works with Xbox and is able to turn your tv and console on and off and also start games. In comparison to the google home I have and the Apple HomePod, After testing out what was initially a free add on- I ended up buying 7 more echos for around my house. I_ definitely say it was worth it.Pros:- very fun to use-simplifies life, entertains friends and guests-great for voicing commands-Automates your house-actually affordable priceCons:-music quality (lack of bass mainly due to size)- needs accessories to be truly functionalEnd note- if you_e looking for a smart assistant for your home that can control anything and always knows the answer- Look no further. If you_e looking for a high quality speaker...be prepared for a little let down. If you_e really worried about the Bass quality, go with the echo plus.",11
1,"Multi-echo household.. not impressed with this model.
  
",7.Dec.18,Yes,"We are a multi-echo household. We've bought echo devices for 4 other family/households. But I am really unimpressed with this one.I tried setting this one up in the kitchen. It was replacing a 2nd gen, which worked flawlessly for most of the year. But I wanted to put the 2nd gen in the basement, and replace it with this 3rd gen... The 3rd gen is slow to respond, to the point one thinks it didn't hear you and is turning off... only to then respond. It constantly drops connection and has a hard time reconnecting. -- the 2nd gen in the basement works perfectly. No dropped connections, no delays in response..I also put a 3rd gen in my bedroom, which has no issues, no delays, no dropped connection. So I assumed it was a bad dot and requested a replacement.Replacement got here today (I wasn't made aware it would be a refurbished one). I'm having the same issues with it. I am sending both back. It seems like it may be something with the wifi inside the dot, that it's not as good as prior generations.I love my other devices.. but this one, not so much.",11
5,"We love our Dots! This was our second; and our favorite!
  
",7.Dec.18,Yes,"The sound is AMAZING. It fills two rooms nicely. It sounds better than our little Bluetooth speaker.  We do have issues with Sirius XM on it.  It could be our internet, or Sirius XM, it keeps losing connection.  I do not think it is the DOT, I think it is our Evil Internet.  We Love The _rop In Feature,  it save us from having to run up &amp; down the stairs..or screaming at eachother. There are so many fun Skills, we have yet to use them all. I do want a third one, for the bedroom.. Dot makes a great alarm clock/ Sleep Machine. I LOVE all the Options.. Story Time, Sleep Sounds, Amazon Music.. REMINDERS, where would I be without REMINDERS.. Oh, I forgot.WE did have to change her name to _omputer.. Anytime I would listen to a video, or be on a call, and _lexa was said..  Ours would respond..LOL. That was driving us batty.Alexa has been working better for our calls, than the _oogle Phone device thingy.  If I did not have to take _rivate calls, I would send that back &amp; get another Dot!We just got some of the light bulbs and are excited to try those.",0
5,"The Echo Dot 3rd Generation is a grand slam!
  
",7.Dec.18,Yes,"The more I integrate my home with the Alexa platform and Alexa compatible devices, the more I love the platform. There are countless ways to access the Alexa platform, and the Echo Dot serves as an inexpensive way to get there - which is exactly what the Dot was meant to do.I had a Dot 2nd Generation in my office, but we needed an additional smart plug for Christmas lights, so I decided to spend the extra $10 or so and get a Dot 3rd Gen / TP-Link Smart Plug bundle over just the Smart Plug itself during the recent Cyber Week sale and I'm so glad I did. I moved my old Dot upstairs and put the Dot 3rd Gen in my office.The new dot not only looks better  - it has a more modern look that matches the rest of the 2nd gen Echo lineup, but the real gem here is that the sound on this thing is FANTASTIC for its size. I mean, the quality of sound that comes out of a device this size is amazing. I never expected to be able to use the Dot for music playback but to have ambient music in my office while I'm working throughout the day this thing is perfect.Sure - an Echo, a nice soundbar, or even digging out my Klipsch Promedias would likely provide much better sound - but for having tunes going while I work this thing is amazing. I had no expectation that this little Dot would be able to put out this much sound.The Dot 3rd Gen is going to be my go-to gift for people from now on. Well done on this one!",0

",7.Dec.18,Yes,"I bought this and other Echo devices after I fell following a hip replacement, couldn't get up because of excruciating pain and had to use one leg to push myself a little at the time to another room to get to my cell phone to call 911. My son was insistent I get some kind of ""I fell down and can't get up"" device.  This is much cheaper than service you have to pay for every month. Just keep in mind you need as many as is necessary to be able to call out to it and that it doesn't work when there is a power failure. There is a battery pack available. I hoped it would be on sale for Christmas but doesn't look like that's going to happen. I actually hate to use it because this one is cute. Of course, I am enjoying more than just the security feature but others will talk about that.",0

",7.Dec.18,Yes,Really happy with my new Echo Dot third generation. I_e added my daily routine_ and smart plugs to my home. Now I_ able to turn on my TV both upstairs and downstairs with an Alexa voice command. My TVs are not smart TV so I have them plugged into the surge protectors which is powered on by the smart plug. Love the new look in the sound  is a lot better than the first generation. Would highly recommend to upgrade. I purchased this on cyber Monday for $29.99 with a free smart plug which is worth $24.99. Great buy.,1

",7.Dec.18,Yes,"These things were on sale for $24.99 for Black Friday, so I ordered 5 of them, a couple for the house and few to gift....after getting them set up, we found them to be pretty cool! Sometimes if the music is too loud, Alexa will have a hard time hearing you call her name, but at a comfortable volume it functions very well, and it understands regular talk....so you don't have to talk like Mr Roboto or baby talk it to get it to understand you.... We have 2 linked so it plays music on both when we are listening to it. feels very sturdy and well built too. Happy with purchase...P.S....One of the first things we did after set-up was disable the auto purchase function in the settings!",0
3,"Good Voice Command Features, Not So Great Speaker
  
",7.Dec.18,Yes,"The Echo Dot is nice for voice commands, but the speaker is not that great. It lacks adequate bass, and doesn't get that lous overall. I like that it has an aux line out where you can connect another better speaker to it.It's really cool that you can just say for example: ""Alexa: play jazz music"" and the Echo Dot will shuffle different jazz songs from the Amazon Music store. I bought this for $25, so I think it is worth that much for the voice commands, and access to tons of free music. You can automatically play any songs in your Amazon library. It has lots of other features that I haven't checked out yet. It's nice to check on the weather and movie times, etc. You can adjust the volume remotely or say ""next song"". Again, good for cool wireless and voice command features. Not so great for sound quality. I ended up buying a separate Bluetooth speaker, and just connected the Echo Dot to it for better sound.",0

I will say that once you start turning your home into a smart home it can get kind of addicting pretty quick, there is just so much that Alexa can do and so many devices she can work with.

It has somewhat better sound quality than the generation 2 Dot, but only on music.  When Alexa speaks there is way too much base.  Other than that it is OK and seems to work.  After chatting with Amazon they suggested I reboot the device.  I did so and played the same song and the issue seemed to be fixed.  So it leaves me wondering if it is a hardware or a software issue.  In any case it does not work as well as my older dot.",0
4,"Sound quality much better, Voice recognition worse
  
",7.Dec.18,Yes,"I use my echo dots alot. I have all kind of routines set up, and they help me everyday.  Lights, Scentsy warmers, Christmas lights, Lamps..etc.  The new Echo Dot...the sound is a little tinny, but still alot louder over all and I really am happy with that.  I have notice it doesn't hear me unless I speak very loudly.  I was right next to it , and my other upstairs in my room and when standing at the bottom of the stairs, my upstairs 2nd Gen dot heard me and responded, but the new one didn't even blink on.So overall..if you don't mind having to speak louder and clearer..go for it",0
5,"Black Friday DEALZ!
  
",7.Dec.18,Yes,"Bought this to upgrade my Echo Dot (1st Gen) smart speaker.  Compared to the 1st generation - this one is amazing! The sound is very nice for how small it is, and I like how responsive this new one feels.  I also feel, like this one has a harder time hearing my voice across the room or right in front of it.  Maybe a software update can fix this, all in all it's a nice upgrade from the 1st generation echo dot.Also, I like the dedicated power plug included in with the speaker - compared to the usb wall wart and micro usb connection.",0
4,"Gen 3 Dot works and sounds great - setup was a step backwards.
  
",7.Dec.18,Yes,"The new size, look and most importantly, sound is fantastic for the Gen 3 Dot.  My only real complaint was the activation process  in the Alexa App, theirs a special option for Gen 3 but after using that, I was never able to select my home network properly and was left with timeout after timeout.  Tried to reset the Dot twice to no avail.  I finally tried the old Gen 1/2 setup procedure which always worked on my other Dots and fortunately, that worked flawlessly for my new Gen 3.  I_ sure Amazon will get the bugs worked out.",0
5,"The Echo Dot is Better Than Ever!
  
",7.Dec.18,Yes,"After having the Echo Dot (2nd Gen) for a year and loving it I thought if take advantage of the Black Friday deal on the (3rd Gen.) Wow, what an extraordinary difference in performance. Way beyond anything I'd expected! She is much more responsive and the output is not too shabby. I have mine connected throughout the house on a speaker system.  However, the speaker alone on the (3rd Gen) is astonishingly good all on its own which was quite a surprise. Upgrade if you haven't yet you won't be disappointed.",0
5,"Easy To Install &amp; Very Convient
  
",7.Dec.18,Yes,"I got started with Alexa, when I bought a smart thermostat with an embedded Alexa. Added the Echo dot because the thermostat is fixed in place.  The Dot was very easy to install, and works in conjunction with the smart thermostat. I have added smart bulbs, and smart plugs from different manufacturers and all are very easy to connect to both of my Alexa devices. Now I can warm up the house and start the coffee before getting out of bed.  Very convenient!",0
1,"Dumb as Dirt
  
",8.Dec.18,Yes,"The Amazon Echo Assistant, Alexa, is simply dumb as dirt.  My Google Assistant on my phone answered questions that Alexa couldn't over and over.  99% of the time, Alexa doesn't know. There is a delay with Alexa that there isn't with Google.  Also, every time it answers, you can't ask it a follow-up question without having to say, ""Alexa"" again, which totally drives me crazy.  Google takes follow up questions without you having to say its name again.  I tried to make an itinerary, and have Alexa read it back, but it was 5 million times easier to just write it down, because Alexa didn't know what I was talking about 90% of the time, so I wound up having to repeat and say the perfect magic words so she would understand, and each time I had to say ""Alexa"" again.  I wound up having a shouting match with her (I suppose I was the only one shouting). Alexa is all hype, but I'd rather use my phone with Google, so I just applied for a refund, and bought a Google Home Mini instead. Do not buy the Echo!!! It will cause you more stress than any benefit. I predict that within a few years, people will get wise and go with Google, and Alexa will disappear, because as soon as people check out Google, they'll want no part of Alexa. It's like a cheap, lousy, idiotic, brainless to the point of hilarity if you're not too angry to appreciate it, knock-off compared to Google Assistant.",8
1,"I don't know why I've resis I'm writing this review :-)
  
",8.Dec.18,Yes,"UPDATE:Lasted a little over a year, and while it comes on, it doesn't hear the commands. And, yes, I've gone through the troubleshooting which doesn't address that the unit has power and no red light. Sending it back for $5!!----------------------------Ok, a little back story. I purchased the Ecobee4 last year and one of the 1st things I did after installing was turn off Alexa. I didn't want to use it and I didn't want it ""listening in"" on my conversations.A few months ago, my TV died and I purchased the Fire TV stick to work with a flat screen TV that no one was using. I had a Roku on the older TV and was always frustrated that I couldn't just tell it what I wanted to watch. When I got the Fire TV stick, it was soooooo easy just to say what I wanted without having to go through the online keyboard to type out my message (I always felt like I was typing out morse code or something).Anyway, I was amazed at how easy the Fire stick was, so I turned on Alexa in the Ecobee. OMG, the first time I used it, my hands were full and I was coming into the house in the evening. I couldn't get to my phone to use the app to turn on the lights. I remembered the Ecobee and had Alexa turn on the lights. WOW, WOW, WOW. I know for some, this may seem like a bit of overkill, but before that night I never realized how easy using Alexa could be. To turn on/off my lights, I would get out my phone, use the app. I would get out my phone, use the app, adjust the thermostat. I did everything from my phone. I know I can say ""Hey Siri"" for my phone to respond without taking the phone out, but Siri has NEVER been able to find my devices or Siri indicates the device aren't responding, very frustrating.After a few days of the Ecobee use, I ordered a Dot!!! I don't know why I resisted this technology for so long. I've had it on my Kindle and never used it. It didn't seem intuitive to use, I felt like I was manufacturing a reason to say ""Alexa"".  OMG #2, today I created a grocery list, WHILE I WAS IN THE KITCHEN, without having to find my phone or pencil/paper. I added to that grocery list during the day with just my voice!!! I went to the store and USED THAT SHOPPING LIST and didn't forget anything!!!!!  I left the store thinking, Alexa, where have you been all my life :-).Now, I've purchased a dot for my elderly mom and I got some of the Alexa outlets so she can control the lights, TV, etc. from her device.I really want the Echo for my car!!! I tried asking Siri to look something up while I was driving and Siri COULDN'T DO IT!!!! The information I Siri provided was incorrect. As a test, when I came home I gave the same instructions to the Echo and was given the correct info!!!! I know Alexa in the car would have been able to provide the correct info!!!!If you're on the fence about the usefulness of this device, try it and you'll be convinced it's well worth the purchase.  Complementary products seem to integrate smoothly and efficiently with Alexa. I've never had a problem with Alexa finding the lights and Apple doesn't work with Nest or Ecobee. If you're concerned about what Alexa records, I've viewed the recordings and there's was nothing there of concern and if there were, I could delete the information.BUY THIS DEVICE!!!! :-)",1
1,"BEYOND DISAPPOINTED
  
",8.Dec.18,Yes,"I cannot emphasize enough how much distain I have for Amazon's Alexa. Half the time she doesn't understand what I am asking the other half of the time she cannot search the internet besides wikipedia for things, which apparently she can only now do as of 12/8 via setting up skills. Skills are also required to have her control fire TV related link like hulu and Netflix. With every new rendition she becomes less helpful not more helpful or harder to set up and then use and this is also not an age related thing as I have worked in tech for years I have 2 dots and 3 echos currently all but one are in use, when I ask her to play music from Amazon music and play it on a group set up for multi room speakers she can't seem to do that even and I have tried naming the group numerous different things in Hopes she will understand me better. Fortunately I am able to return a few of these things still and plan on doing just that. So beware, I for one am Extremely disappointed in the sound quality, I understand that the speaker is small but honest to GOD my Samsung smart watch phone and Apple Beats speakers have better quality. I have purchased and tried every generation of these so far and will not be buying any future ones. Depending on what you are buying for and expectations, I would suggest going with a google home rather than these Good luck and happy disappointment to all",2
5,"Much better than the 2nd gen Echo Dot
  
",8.Dec.18,Yes,"I used to have a 2nd gen echo dot, which I use it as the computer's speaker, it was doing it's work just fine, but always think the volume was too low. Saw the 3rd gen on sale, and decided to give it a try. Oh my, this is one of the best purchase I've ever done to my life.The 3rd Gen is slightly bigger than the 2nd gen, and it does required a different power plug, so you will have to replace everything if you are currently using the 2nd gen echo dot. However, this echo dot's audio is much better than the 2nd gen. the 2nd gen was more of a mono tone audio, whiile the 3rd gen offer crystal clear with bass and everything, it is also much louder than the 2nd gen as well. I would say the volume lv 3 is equal to the lv 10 on 2nd gen, that's how much the difference is.Right now I am using my 3rd gen echo dot for the following1) Alarm Clock: I have given command to Alexa to play classical music every morning to wake me up2) Weather: Just say ""Alexa, how's the weather"" and she will tell me all the details3) Traffic: I have set my commute address via the alexa app, so I just need to say ""Alexa, how's my commute, and she will tell me the traffic condition, I am never late to work ever again4) desktop speaker: you just need to hook it up with bluetooth and it is ready to go, plain and simple5) music station: sometimes when I don't feel like using my computer, I just ask alexa to play music(via amazon music), or play the radio station when I am laying on bed relaxing.I would highly recommand you to give this dot a try, it certainly improve your living standard!",0
3,"Not So Smart
  
",8.Dec.18,Yes,"Perhaps my expectations were too high, but I am disappointed in the amount of information that ""Alexa"" has. (More on that below.) I love her for her ""chattiness"" (try, ""Alexa, let's chat"".), her games, the immediacy of news items, the light-heartedness, and the availability of what she *does* know, e.g. who stars in movies and shows. When used with Amazon Music, it opens up a whole new world! ""Echo, play some soothing instrumental music,"" and you're asleep in minutes.I am quite UNhappy with the following:&gt; It can only be addressed by four different titles:  Alexa, Computer, Echo, or Amazon&gt; Voice recognition is only moderately accurate, failing *much* too often, and it does not allow for more than one user.&gt; It does not allow nearly enough response time before assuming that one is not going to respond at all There should be a setting for this.&gt; Far, far too many subjects and questions are met with, ""Sorry. I don't know that.""&gt; The tone of the voice is deep enough that it interferes with understanding her sometimes. I have been unable to find anywhere to tweak the tone.&gt; The language skills are limited and underused. This could be a PHENOMENAL tool for language learners!A lower price would be welcome, but I would still recommend having one of these with the caveat that one does not expect her to know everything. In spite of her shortcomings, ""Little Miss Echo"" is a keeper.",0
4,"Great sound quality can use amazon certified smart plugs
  
",8.Dec.18,Yes,I like the concept of Alexa that you can literally ask her almost anything. She has a tons of cool skills and features. Something that made me dislike this is that  Alexa recorded me talking on the phone and then replayed my entire conversation this is not safe. That invaded my privacy. I dont Like that when i play music it has a ton of static eitherUpdate received a replacement Alexa sound quality is absolutely amazing.  Amazon told me when I thought Alexa was invading my privacy it was actually her thinking I had an announcement to make. So please disregard the invading privacy! I nolonger hear the static.Volume max is a ten it_ loud enough for me. I usually Keep my volume on a four or five. Sometimes when i ask Alexa something she doesn_ always respond to her name or turn on but overall it_ good!  I do wish Alexa was a little more like google just a tad bit when i say That I_ referring to her intelligence. I did switch Alexa name to Echo because for some reason she would always think i was saying her name when i wasnt. She is connected to a smart plug and it_ amazing i come In and say Echo turn on the lights and she does. Get one i love playing my music on there when I_ cleaning up or when i have guest over. I gave it a 4/5 because it can still use a little improvement but overall nice!,0
3,"So close to perfect
  
",8.Dec.18,Yes,"I bought this so I could shout out the names of tunes to play while working around the house. For the most part, it works great, but you will quickly learn the limitations of Alexa.There will come a time when it won't even come close to recognizing what you are saying. It will play something totally off the wall or something that doesn't even sound remotely what you asked it too! I have gone directly to Amazon Music, played a song from there, asked Alexa to play the last song I played, asked what it was playing, have it recite it back perfectly, ask it to play it again and have it play back something random or claim it can't find it. Alexa just bones the product. Google rarely has this level of misunderstanding!Amazon really needs to polish this. It is frustrating. The thing sounds so nice for its size, but you spend way too much time arguing with Alexa. She is deaf!",1
4,"Good updates but still needs minor improvements
  
",8.Dec.18,Yes,"I really like the Echo's, and the newest version gives a better sound output but I wish they would improve on the sound pickup.  I have had my Echo's on shelves, some facing outward from the wall, some high, some low and I still have not found the perfect spot where alexa will hear me just right unless I am extremely close to her or yelling for her to do some action. (turn off light, switch stations, etc....)*Maybe for future generations they will put in better sound pickup all around her so that she will hear you whether she is laying flat or vertical.*Right now it is trial and error to find the sweet spot in which you can say commands without waking up the whole house :)Overall it is a good product, you just have to get used to her and what she is capable of.",0
4,"I've grown happier with my purchase over time
  
",8.Dec.18,Yes,"It does what it says it does, but I'm not finding it terribly useful yet. I thought it was an intercom thing for the Ring 2 doorbell it was sold with, but that doesn't appear to be the case. If I want to ask questions about the weather, etc., I can ask my tablet PC instead, which is likely to be closer by, but I hope I will eventually find a use for it.Update: Since my original review, I've bought another. The khaki one blends with my decor better than the black one. The Echo Show does what I wanted re: the doorbell, but the Dots have taken over for casual questions or when I want smart lamps on/off. Alexa has also developed more personality. It can be annoying when Alexa misunderstands what I wanted. Overall, though, it has become a useful convenience.",0
5,"Big improvement
  
",8.Dec.18,Yes,"I had the 2nd gen dot, and other of the devices, but the problem with the 2nd gen was it's lack of a real speaker and its plasticy cheap feeling. This new 3rd gen is definitely a vast improvement over the 2nds sound. I can actually hear it when I am taking a shower (as one does sit in my bathroom) or hear it pretty clear from anywhere in my house. Mind you I do have the Echo plus, 2 other dots, and the 1st Gen Show placed in different areas of the house, but the point is instead of having to have music play through all the devices if i want I can just use that one 3rd gen dot. It also has a more premium look and feel vs just the plastic 2nd gen. I have purchased 4 more gen 3s as gifts for family members for Christmas. I highly recommend this product",0
2,"Brand new defective 3rd Gen echo dot replaced with a refurbished one
  
",8.Dec.18,Yes,"I purchased three of these new 3rd Gen echo dots and one of them had no audio right out of the box.  I was able to set it up without the sound and it played fine thru a Bluetooth speaker, just not thru its own.  The other two worked fine.  I tried to make a product exchange online which would always loop me back to the same form which I filled out multiple times, always failing. I then tried online chat support and was required to troubleshoot the ""problem"" for over an hour even though it was obvious that the other two worked fine and this one did not.  They finally agreed to replace the unit and they sent me a refurbished one.  I paid for a new one, spent an hour trying to get a replacement, and recieved a used refurbished unit.  This is not the Amazon Customer Service I am accustomed to.  Especially on their own product.  Other than that, the sound is only slightly better than the Gen2 model and it has a better look.  The upgrade was certainly not worth the hassle I had to go through.",0
1,"I got an used device, w/o power cable, not in the official package
  
",8.Dec.18,Yes,"I received this item as a replacement from another purchase that arrived defective. Thank you for that. The device seems to be working properly so far.However, I have two complains. First, the product arrived without the power cable. Secondly, it was an used item (refurbished) and I paid for a new one.With respect to the first complain, I will understand that when returning the old Echo Dot, I should do it without the cable. That is what I did, otherwise I would had an incomplete product.About the second, it is  very disappointing and ultimately, lack of respect for your customers. How can I know if the device has all its functionalities working correctly? Can you assure me that the item will have the same expected life as a new one? I'm worried about these issues, besides the fact that I paid for a NEW device, not an used one.",1

",8.Dec.18,Yes,"11/9/2018So far we love these. I bought 3 echo dots on black friday. 2 came in  sets with sengled smart lightbulbs and 1 came in a set with tp link smart plugs.  We added extra bulbs and plugs to our order. So we basically have a starter smart home now. I love it I suffer from severe migraines. Being able to dim or turn off the lights in a room with my voice is priceless. The plugs are attached to my aquariums lights and now I can control them wirelessly as well or have them set on a timer. I love the music feature as well as the intercom/drop in feature. I am so satisfied so far. Will be ordering an echo auto and more lights, plugs and a compatible thermostat ASAP.",0
4,"Almost perfect
  
",8.Dec.18,Yes,"The AC Adapter is much to large and charging should be accomplished using a micro USB cable and AC adapter preferably the size of a small ubiquitous Apple Cube the Echo Dot charger is almost 3 times larger - there is no sound reason for this.  The reason why having a large AC Adapter is an issue is because it takes up too much space at the electrical outlet  (See image provided) Also, the device must be continually plugged in - thus eliminating the ability for portability - it should be a rechargeable - it's not. Also the design should allow for wall mounting, didn't anyone think of that ?",0
5,"What a Big ""punch"" for such a small device.
  
",8.Dec.18,Yes,"This is my first experience with an Amazon Alexa device and I read many reviews before purchasing. Many of the reviews have ""things to say"" regarding the sound quality. This is quite the small device and I don't think it is meant for a large space. I have it on a shelf in my bedroom and the sound is rich, bass is very good, and overall it's ""clear as a bell"" not ""tinny"" at all and I tend to be an audio snob. I have already made phone calls , which I like. I can't wait to try all the other features! I am quite impressed. Well worth the price.",0
2,"Not as great as I was told.
  
",8.Dec.18,Yes,The sound is not nearly as good as my I thought it might be. Also I get quite a few disconnects that makes using the thing a pain in the butt. It's be just sitting getting no use now due to it not working like it should. Everything thing else that's wifi works with no issues in my house. Yet the dot seems to have issues staying connected all the time. Looking into the Google options now. All my friends have recommended the echo line so I figured I'd give it a shot. Must have got a _. Gonna go shop the Google offering and see if the grass is greener on the other side.,0
5,"Great price and good sound!
  
",8.Dec.18,Yes,"The 3rd generation of the dot is the best by far. This sounds so much better than the prior gen dots!If the dot has too little or too much treble, mid-range or base, you can adjust these levels in the Alexa app so it_ more pleasing to your ears If you listen to music.If you want a low priced Amizon Alexa device, this it it. Don_ let the price (I paid $24) fool you. It sounds good for how small it is.",0

",9.Dec.18,Yes,"Alexa se ha convertido en una excelente herramienta para la administración de todos los dispositivos en casa, a pesar que aún no viene en español con mi nivel inglés y los comandos claros que vienen en las instrucciones he sacado gran provecho.

",9.Dec.18,Yes,"I wanted to try this because it_ suppose to understand you better, and a better speaker would be nice.  Well, it hears a little better, but still misunderstands a lot, for more than I_ expect from the richest man in the world.  The sound is full, but it_ a little too full for the voice coming out of it.  There_ just something we don_ like about it, but we can_ put our finger on it.  We also weren_ happy that the new speaker design can hide the LED ring a little and it kind of makes it look like it_ gained weight.  I like the sleekness of the 2nd gen.  But music does sound better.  I was hoping to replace some key Alexa_ in my house, but in decided to just stick with one.  It_ an upgrade I guess, but not as good as I hoped.  Maybe you_l have a different experience, as I am in a vaulted-ceiling room.  But come on, you know Bezos has vaulted ceilings somewhere.  Imagine being that rich.  Wow.  But I digresss.",1
5,"An absolutely excellent smart speaker with so many great functions.
  
",9.Dec.18,Yes,"Well, I had a very awesome Cyber Monday! Though I only bought one thing, it was definitely a doozy! It is nothing less than Amazon's own smart speaker, connected to one of the best virtual assistants that I have used, Alexa! (I realize now this statement doesn't carry much weight because there's only four major ones, but I will now say that this is the best I've used, due to its ability to do pretty much everything I can think of, and ease of access - I can just talk and it works! (This is also true of Cortana, but Alexa is not dependent on a large, heavy-power-drawing device like a computer running Windows to be usable, so Alexa wins.)Alexa can answer pretty much any question that may come to mind, though there are a few that still haven't occurred to her, but that is fast changing due to crowd-sourced reviews and feedback that are easily provided for every interaction! And that's even before I mentioned the thousands of skills, reminders, timers and routines and all sorts of awesome things that the assistant can do. And all when you say her wake word which just happens to be Alexa (though I am authoring this with a text-to-speech program, I must type the assistant's name to avoid awakening her so many times :) ).The device itself is pretty elegant, as you can see my picture and video. It's grown up quite a bit from the second generation which I have never had, but it is larger and heavier, and has a big old band of cloth around it instead of it being plastic with the Amazon logo. There are four buttons on top: two for adjusting volume, one to perform some kind of action which might actually double for using the wake word; I'm not sure yet, and one to mute the microphones, of which there are four of the far-field variety, which enable the speaker to hear your voice even when it is far away and rather quiet, or when music or other audio is playing through the speaker itself! That's pretty awesome.So many other people have talked about the virtual assistant, Alexa, that I will not waste time here, because I'm mainly here to talk about the speaker itself. And I will close by saying, I'm not really concerned about a proprietary power solution over a USB solution, though I am aware that some inconvenience can exist when one cannot use power adapters one already has. Doesn't affect me, though. And the speaker is actually quite loud, probably potentially the loudest Bluetooth-enabled speaker that I've heard, and sounds wonderful pretty much no matter what is played through it!I most definitely recommend the Amazon Echo Dot third-generation! In your color of choice, though the Sandstone does look very snazzy :-) thank you, Amazon for providing us all a wonderful and affordable entry into the exciting world of virtual assistants and the Alexa infrastructure! I will treasure it forever. And, who knows? I may kit my house out with at least a couple more before holidays are out.(EDIT: As a side note, I just played back the short video I linked above, and Alexa woke up again and gave me several varieties of cheese. She's just that awesome.)",0
5,"Worth having a few of these in your house
  
",9.Dec.18,Yes,"I use mine every day, but I probably wouldn't have bought this without other smart home items. Alexa is neat and has a lot of cool skills, plus you can build your own. I've got my Hues lights connected to it right now, so I can control my lights with voice commands. Right now with IFTTT I also have it setup so that when I leave the lights turn off, and when I come home from work they're on already. I wake up to slowly rising light, and am reminded to get ready for bed by steadily dimming light. When they turn blue I know it's raining and I should go bring my dog inside. When they're bright blue it's snowing, like today! Alexa also plays Twitch audio, Prime music (another subscription, ugh), and can be a regular bluetooth speaker as well. You can usually pick one of these up in a bundle for a steal, I got mine for $1.09 when I tried out Prime Music Unlimited.",0
4,"Fun, pretty much a part of the family now.
  
",9.Dec.18,Yes,"We have 3, 2 3rd gens and one 2nd gen. Like all the reviews say the 3rd ones are way better. I really like that I can play music all over and wake my family up. I like the drop in feature the most. And to make an announcement.Things I don't like are that it doesn't know a lot. And that can get super frustrating really fast. And sometimes it plays music while in a drop in or call. It won't Google search and won't call on Facebook messenger I also can't figure out how to get my phone to Bluetooth to the speakers so I can play music on YouTube.I like to use it to set reminder's to do diaper laundry in 4 days or to set doctor appointment's for my kids my kids like to use it to play games and stuff as well.

After only about two weeks of loving the little Echo, I bought the newer one.  The third generation has great audio quality!  I use my Echo in the kitchen as an alternative to listening to over-the-air radio.  I used my iPhone for radio via TuneIn, but the iPhone's sound quality was brash and unpleasant.  Both the Echo devices are an improvement over both!  I've used Echo for quick news briefs, weather reports and background music.I have two ""smart"" plugs linked to both Echo devices - one for a bedroom lamp and the other controlling a light in the dining room.

",9.Dec.18,Yes,"I thought when buying the Dot(3rd Gen) it would be easy to connect and start using immediately.

Since my modem is set to 5.0 ghz, through Spectrum Cable, I cannot acquire the necessary ghz to operate my Dot.If you have any knowledge to help please advise.David Bornhorst",1
3,"Not as good as 2nd Gen
  
",9.Dec.18,Yes,"Microphones are not as good as 2nd Gen. Echo has a much harder time of hearing our commands with this device vs. the older 2nd Gen device. Also, seems to be slower at answering. You can say ""Alexa"" and it will 2 seconds before the blue ring even lights up, then another couple seconds before she follows through with the command or request. We have our lights controlled by Alexa and the older device could get the lights on and off in less then 2 seconds of making the request. This one really has to think about it before Alexa will do it. Not very happy with the purchase at all. May return and just get another older 2nd Gen one since it seems to work better. It has 6 mics vs. the 4 in the newest model.",0

",9.Dec.18,Yes,We have an original Echo device as well as several Dot's.  I have a Dot in my garage and like to listen to music when I am working on a project in the garage.  I am a big fan of the old Big Band sound including Glenn Miller and Benny Goodman.  I was in the garage a few days ago and was listening to Glenn Miller when the dot fell off my work bench and into an empty 5 gallon plastic bucket.  All of a sudden this robust sound I had never heard from a Dot came roaring out.  My garage Dot now hangs from a hook inside a bucket. It has a much better sound than the Echo which is pretty impressive on it's own.  Go drop your Dot in a bucket and enjoy a new and improved sound.  Enjoy!,0
5,"Miracle Nightstand Device!
  
",9.Dec.18,Yes,"This little guy lives on my nightstand. I use the Headspace skill to go to sleep and every morning it wakes me up to NPR and the weather and traffic. I can also vocally add items to my to do list without turning the light on and it keeps the repetitive thoughts from taking over. I feel like I_ living in the future.My 1st gen Echo recently bit the dust but I can say that the audio quality of the Echo is 1000% better. I used the Echo for music but the Dot I only use for convenience. I_e gotten a HomePod that lives in the living room for music, though, and nothing comes close to its audio quality, not even the Bose speakers I had before.",0
2,"I'm far more comfortable with my Google smart speaker.
  
",9.Dec.18,Yes,"I have given both Google and Amazon smart speakers tests for over a year now. I take comfort in the fact that my Google speaker recognizes my voice, and for the most part only my voice. It's very disconcerting that Alexa will activate with anything that even remotely sounds like the name... At least 20, 30 or even 40 times per day it activates (and starts listening) simply because of a phrase on TV. Admittedly, there are lots of Alexa commercials, but it SHOULD be smart enough to know the difference!  I DO NOT LIKE KNOWING THAT A DEVICE IN MY HOME CAN BE TRICKED INTO LISTENING TO, AND RECORDING, CONVERSATIONS IN MY HOUSEHOLD WHEN NOT INSTRUCTED TO.",0
4,"Good buy but doesn_ meet the hype
  
",9.Dec.18,Yes,"I_ not over-the-moon impressed with it, but for basic tasks, it makes it easier than having to take your phone out for every _oogleable inquiry. Setting timers and playing music is also helpful. I haven_ tested all the features yet, but so far, I_ having a hard time seeing how much I_l actually use it, but I_ open to learning more.I think sometimes it is far too difficult for it to pick up my voice. It_ supposed to be able to hear you even in a noisy room, but that hasn_ been the case for me. I swear sometimes it can_ understand me even in silence and I speak to it with clear, nonaccented American  English.",0
4,"An amazing device that you won't regret owning
  
",9.Dec.18,Yes,"I finally decided to take the plunge on a smart device so I decided to go with the echo dot 3rd generation because it was on sale for the holidays. I'm very glad I did because this thing is amazing, I can use it to control my tv, my xbox one and soon an led light strip from merkury. The only issue I have with the device is for some reason when I use it to turn off the xbox then try to turn off my tv it wont work and alexa tells me the TV isn't responding. I'm not sure if it's a problem with my echo dot or my tv. The tv I have is the sony 43xbr800d. Other than that the thing is amazing and I wish I would have gotten one sooner.",0
5,"Life is easier with the echo
  
",9.Dec.18,Yes,I just love my echo I'm still learning everyday new things from alexa and new ways top use the echo which is thrilling in itself. But life is easier my husband and children also are able to enjoy it. The timer and the adding things to my calendar are my favorite and the drop in on my kids when I'm at work to check on all of them . I love that my husband is reminded of appointments when I'm not around to remind him and everyone can ask what's on the schedule for the day so they know what needs attention in the house internally and externally.,0
5,"Bigger Speaker More Bass...
  
",9.Dec.18,Yes,"I am getting older and my hearing is not as good as it once was.  The Echo three was a replacement for the Echo two and my hearing and first impression say this is a nice overall improvement estheticly but the bass jumped out at me.  It was boomy and at first I did not care for the sound .  After I found out I could adjust treble, bass and midrange through Alexa the sound is a little more tailored.  Not great but much better.  Still the bass throws me off but the overall sound is much improved.  I suspect a younger set of ears will really appreciate what Amazon has done and the kicking bass of the speaker.  I for one want more high end and midrange with a little less boom.",0
5,"Great Sound
  
",9.Dec.18,Yes,"I'm currently a college student in a dorm room and this is a great way to play music in my room! The sound quality is pretty great and it's fairly easy to use, I just connect the Echo to my phone's hotspot. I do wish that the Alexa app was a little easier to use though, and I wish that my Echo would atuomatically connect to my phone's hotspot when I turn it on, because I have to re-pair it with my phone each time I use it, which takes about three minutes each time. Not a huge deal, but I would like it if I didn't have to do that haha. Overall great device.",0
5,"It_ a hoot. _
  
",9.Dec.18,Yes,"When my wife and I discussed getting an Echo Dot, she said _hat do we need that for? I told her I thought it would be fun and a helpful device. Well, we are not disappointed at all. It_ fun and we are using it for shopping lists, playing music on demand, answering questions and telling us jokes and puns, etc. There are many things we have to learn, but it_ easy to use and I am sure we will find more and more things to use it for.",0
1,"I would_e given it zero stars (UPDATED)
  
",10.Dec.18,Yes,"I would have given it zero stars but that option isn_ available. I give ECHO a simple command like turn on (names) light. It says _everal devices are named (names) light, which one do you want? I repeat the exact same name and it turns it on. Why am I repeating myself!!?Also, _CHO, turn off living room light. Response... _cho doesn_ support that.I called customer service and they admittedly stated that it_ learning and evolving and there was NOTHING they could do about ECHO_ performance. The wake word and device names are more than simple but ECHO can not perform them. Customer service agrees that ECHO should understand simple commands and they double checked my naming convention . Simple simple names that should work.Update:Back down to 1 star and that_ being generous. Simple commands are not heard and being yelled across the room. I live in a small, 1,100 sq ft home with 3 echo dots. All the dots are placed in an optimum position for the room. This product isn_ even a good voice activated switch. I tell it,  Echo, turn on Stephens light. It_ reply  There are several devices named Stephens light, which one do you want? It does this over and over and over. At least 20x this morning, switching to different devices. The same reply every time. I_ calling customer service again so they can tell me I need to change the names or what I call the lights to _he Stephens light. THAT DOESN_ WORK EITHER!If you want a product that works sometimes heed this device. If you like things to work as stated, then steer clear of these $30, over glorified voice controlled Echos.Buyers Beware!Junk junk junk! At best.If you_e used another voice enabled device, you will know of ECHO_ shortcomings immediately. Namely, it can_ follow a simple command or even turn on or off a simple tv with their junky firetv stick.Laughable product.I just added a couple stars back because of customer service. I actually got a call back because of the bad review. Customer service was professional and noted the shortcomings to be forwarded to the powers to be. I was given the option to send it all back including the firetv stick or possibly allow him to troubleshoot with me. At the low price paid for the package deal, I figured it would be easier to give him a chance. He discovered a silly way to talk to echo and it appeared to work. Now I say _cho, turn on the (names) light and it appears to work. I know Amazon doesn_ like to hear this, but they have a long way to go to catch up to Apple TVs. But for the price, and if you_e never used the Siri enabled Apple TV. Well this is just another part of the reason I went 2 stars.Another cool thing I noticed is my recently watched episodes were right at the top of the home screen.For the money, I_ not sending it back. I_l just deal with it_ shortcomings.",10
1,"Poor documentation
  
",10.Dec.18,Yes,I now have 2 dot 3gen and for the most part  I figured out how to use them by trial and errorThe documentation that comes with the device is usless.There is nothing to tell you what app you have to download on a phone and there is no explanation of anything on the app. What are the buttons on the screen? no explanationI fumbled around to fiquire out what did what and I still not completely sureThis is a bust for me but they were presents from my kids for my birthday so that is the only reason im keepimg themI just found out my issue with playing spotify all night is a known issue and they are working on itSorry to say this but if they were not gifts I would return them,3
4,"I_ buying a second
  
",10.Dec.18,Yes,"The first thing I noticed other than the physical was the sound. The sound is louder than the Dot v2. It also has better bass. It has too much bass. Fortunately, the app has an equalizer to adjust the sound. If it weren_ for the muddy low end, I would have given this 6 out of 5 stars. Yes, 6 out of 5 because it would have exceeded my expectations. Oh, one other thing on the sound. I listen to my Dot while falling asleep. The lowest sound level could be a bit lower.I_ glad it still has Bluetooth and a 3.5 mm audio out. I like having options. My Google Home Mini lacks both.  You can use the Bluetooth to stream to other devices. Works nicely with my TV_ sound bar.The Dot v3 is also larger than v2, but not by much. I like that it still has the tactile buttons on the top. The fabric shell is more attractive than the plastic of previous models. The power adapter is larger than the Dot 2_. I_ like to see a smaller adapter, but if you want the sound, you need the power.I have two Dots. I_e replaced the first with this new version. I already picked up a second to replace the other. The reminds me, when I replaced the first Dot, I didn_ have to enter my wireless network password. I guess it talked to the other Dot or the app and figured things out. It was a breeze to replace my previous Dot.",0
5,"Very helpful and easy to use
  
",10.Dec.18,Yes,"We decided to buy 1 echo dot and see how we liked it and the features it offered before buying more. I ordered a second one today. First off, it is very easy to set up and use. After spending a few minutes downloading the app to my phone and setting up the wifi, we were good to go. My 5 and 6 year olds love it! Within a few ml minutes, my 6 year old had Alexa telling knock knock jokes and helping her spell words for her homework. My 5 year old started requesting songs and had a blast switching through our Amazon music playlists. I can now control setting our home alarm, unlocking the front door and changing the thermostat all while still shopping on Amazon by just asking Alexa. Setting a timer for the kids to finish tasks has been helpful too. The second dot is going upstairs, so when it's time to get the kids up for school, I can have Alexa start their wake up playlist. It makes it effortless to play music through the house, which keeps us all moving and on task.",0
5,"All you need in an Amazon Echo.
  
",10.Dec.18,Yes,"I have to admit that I have several Echos.  I purchased the first generation Echo at half price ($99) when it first came out as a Prime exclusive.  I found it to be quite impressive for playing music and several of the other helpful tasks that my family uses it for (News, Math for the kid, homework help, timers, alarms, etc.).  Since then, the device has added so many features that we decided to add them to nearly every room.  I have a 2nd Gen in the kitchen/family room - the 1st Gen was moved to the basement.  I have a Spot next to my bed, and we purchased a dot for my son's room.  Now to the heart of the matter: the 3rd Gen Dot I purchased at the irresistible price of $24.  I wasn't sure what to do with it, so I placed it in the office.  After hearing the sound quality, I was so impressed that I considered switching the Spot out of my room.  This thing is all you need in any room of about 15' x 15'.  Great sound quality and all the features of the full size Echos.  For those who don't know, the Echos can be linked together for whole-home music; they can be used as intercoms between rooms; they can make announcements across the whole system; they can give weather and news reports; they can make phone calls; and they allow you to communicate directly with anyone else who has one anywhere in the world.  If you want to try out the technology, look no further than the 3rd Gen Dot.  Even at the $30 price point, it's a bargain with the sound improvements over the original Dot, which was a bit weak and tinny.",0
5,"Better
  
",10.Dec.18,Yes,"I love my 2nd gen echo dot and use it every day. I decided it was time to get a new one for another part of the house. My decision was between what I already had and loved, or trying the new 3rd gen. I'd read some other reviews that talked about some pros and cons. I haven't done a lot of testing but I can say, after using it for a few days, I love it and would recommend it. Three things I'll mention:1. The sound is much better.2. It's bigger (think 50% larger).3. Alexa doesn't seem to be the same software version, or something. My 2nd gen dot responds better, I feel, than my 3rd gen, to commands. I haven't run into anything that's a deal breaker, but it has been noticeable.So would I recommend this? Yes, of course. Would I recommend it over the 2nd gen? I think so, yes. Now go get one and enjoy it!",0
4,"Fun, and helpful. Overall I'm loving it. Great for your aging parents
  
",10.Dec.18,Yes,"I give nothing 5 stars, nothing is a perfect product, so 4 stars means I totally love it so far. My mother recently got 2 of these, she lives in the tropics and wants to remain there!  After my father passed a couple of years ago she's been there by herself.  I worry about her on many levels.  Even though she'd been around my dots, I must admit I was a bit worried about her acceptance and usage, but by day 5 Alexa was her new bff.  By the 2nd week she didn't know how she lived without Alexa and the smart plugs, and bulbs. Anyhow, I programmed her Alexa  with many reminders and routines.  I can login to her Alexa with the app from here.  Lock her doors, feed the dogs, take her scripts, tell her good night...the list goes on. (Every week I send her a new phrase for Alexa to say to her). My mother having these gives me piece of mind.",0
5,"Very Nice Update
  
",10.Dec.18,Yes,"I picked one of these up for my girlfriend and was pleasantly surprised with it.  I is noticeably smaller than previous Dots and quite heavy for its size (just for its size, it isn't really that heavy).  I expected to have the same issues I have with previous echo products with getting it connected to the network.  I plugged it in and suddenly got a notification on my phone asking if I wanted to connect it to the network.  I said yes and it has work fine.  Very nice update.  I was a bit disappointed that it is no longer a USB power plug but a small round adapter hardwired into the wall plug.  Nothing that takes a star off my rating but something to note.Overall, I like this update from the older one that I have and the speaker sounds really good on its own.",0
1,"Don't buy if you don't have your own Private Wifi
  
",10.Dec.18,Yes,"Not sure if I just didn't read all the details and information, or if it was just never disclosed. But I recently purchased the Echo Dot and was excited to use it. I live on campus in student housing. While attempting to set up my Dot I was informed by tech support (after an hour on the phone redoing everything I had already done alone) that my school's internet was not private enough to protect my information. I'm glad keeping my information private is a concern for Amazon, it's just unfortunate I had purchased this and was so excited to use it just to be told I can't unless I buy my own private internet. Which as a poor college student I don't want to dish out more money on something that's not quite necessary. Again, I'm glad my info and privacy is a top concern, just wishing for future customers for them to know that if they don't have a personal wifi it won't work.",1
1,"Wants to stay in sleep mode after using it for a bit.
  
",10.Dec.18,Yes,"Not real impressed with this so far, it's a little buggy,  it will work for a bit, and then it won't answer back for a while.I've unplugged it, reset it, still the same, when it works, it's great, seems to have it's own mine of when it wants to work lol.That's why the 4 stars, and if the next one is like this one, I'll drop stars down to 1.Been disappointed in it so far, but let's see.I have another one coming in a that is in a package deal, I'll up date when I get it.I hope it works better.Update, after having Alexa for a while, it is the most piece of crap I've bought!It doesn't work half the time, and when it does it's great, but don't waste your time with this, I bought 2 of them, I sure wish I had my money back.Stick with Google.",0
4,"Nice
  
",10.Dec.18,Yes,"I received it yesterday and I was able to connect it very fast. I have Alexa 2nd generation and I was thinking about trading it for the 3rd generation. However, I remembered the "" I robot"" movie and how replacing the old technology robots with the new ones lead to revolution :). I actually decided to keep both, the new one in the living room as it has a better sound and the old one in the living room. They work great with each other. I only wish that Amazon allows us to customize the name instead of using the existing names (Alexa, Echo, Amazon or computer). I like Alexa name but sometimes it gets confusing if I name both of my dots as Alexa so I kept Alexa for the old one and renamed the new one as echo.",0
5,"Great Black Friday deal
  
",10.Dec.18,Yes,"Never used an Echo or a Dot before.  After receiving it, I bought a Echo to use in another room.  Really simple to set up.  Added several skills including control of my ADT alarm system, all of my Z-wave switches' lights, and various subscription music services I use.  Just added my ceiling fans to the skill set.  If you didn't use it for anything else, for $25 its a great clock (just ask Alexa what time it is) in the middle of the night.  Another product that I didn't need and now I don't want to be without it.  I'm sure I have just scratched the surface on the capabilities of this unit.BTW-the first unit was lost in transit and Amazon was right on it--even though by then it was backordered,  it arrived only a couple of days late----but stuff happens at this time of year.",0
5,"Big Update from Original Dot
  
",10.Dec.18,Yes,"Big boost in Bluetooth performance and sound quality.  Buy 3rd Gen instead of the 2nd Gen.  The improvement far outweighs the small cost difference.If you're like me (bought the original Dot at $89 and was bruised when 6-weeks later the price was slashed in half) it's OK to shake off lingering resentment and buy an ""all new"" 3rd Gen Dot.  You immediately enjoy the new experience.The Alexa platform is getting smarter.  The mobile app interface is cluttered, but Amazon is constantly improving.  My grandparents (and everyone I know) gets hooked on Alexa in a flash.  Besides a better price point, Alexa beats both Apple and Google hands-down (IMHO) .",0
4,"Impressed!!
  
",10.Dec.18,Yes,"I've been using the 2nd gen for a while. One for the bedroom, one for the kitchen. I liked them, sound quality really wasn't there though. I saw this and thought, ehhhh how much better can it be. Figured I'd order one while it was $29.99. Hooked it up and whoa!!!! Quite a different little machine!! It's much louder than the 2nd gen. The sound easily fills our kitchen and living room. My husband didn't know I ordered it and was surprised when he first heard it. I went ahead and ordered a second while at this price. I had to remove a star only because while playing at high volume, she can't hear my commands, I pretty much need to yell at her.",0
3,"Microphone could be better
  
",10.Dec.18,Yes,"This is my second Echo product. I also have the echo plus which I had first. The sound quality of the music is good enough for me considering it's a small speaker. I tend to use it more than my Bose Bluetooth speaker due to ease just asking Alexa to play music.I give it 3 stars due to the microphone and voice recognition. At times,I have to yell at the dot for Alexa to hear me when I'm sitting less than 30 feet away. I sometimes repeat commands before she responds. I do not have this problem with tbe Echo Plus. Still, this is a pretty cool device. I use it for weather and traffic updates, music, controlling lamps and asking random questions.",0
5,"Like hands-free Googling, but so much more!
  
",10.Dec.18,Yes,"Pros: I say, ""Alexa, good morning,"" and she bids me a good morning, then goes on to tell me something interesting. Sometimes short, but sometimes in depth. If I'm cooking, or just busy, I'll say, ""Alexa, add brown surgar to the shopping list. Alexa repeats my request, and adds it to my shopping list, found in my cell phone Alexa app. ""Alexa, play Elvis Christmas songs,"", and within a couple of seconds is playing Elvis from iTunes. I'm hoping to buy a security camera or two (I'll need to purchase cloud space - pretty inexpensive), but there are dozens of such 1080 ppi cameras available, and 3rd Gen Echo/Alexa can give you your own smart security system. One can use Alexa as a timer, give your favorite sports teams schedules, or simply a quick banana bread recipe. Just ask Alexa! Love it/her! lolCons - Both my Echo Dot and new 4K smart Fire TV are linked to my wi-fi, but I'm having some trouble linking the two together. Same issue with a couple of smart wal plugs, but I've only put about 45 minutes into the process, so I should get it together pretty soon.As long as you have wi-fi access, the 3rd Gen Echo Dot (and Alexa) are an incredible value, and I'm planning on purchasing two more, one for the kitchen, and one for my bedroom, as you can use them as a house intercom system!Mine was from Amazon Prime (Dec. 2018) for $24.00. I'm a 62 year old man, and think these devices rock!!!",0
1,"Horrible support and horrible voice recognition
  
",10.Dec.18,Yes,"I purchased the new Dot to replace a 2nd gen that I was happy with but the sound was sub par. The new Dot v3 has great sound, however the voice recognition is terrible, either not hearing my _lexa command or misunderstanding the command I give it. Keep in mind this Dot is in the same location and setup as the 2nd gen I replaced, but failed to accurately decipher my command at least 2-3 times more often.I initiated the return process since many reviews tout the new version as being superior to the V2, but Amazon refuses to replace the product. I_e jumped through their hoops troubleshooting yet they won_ refund me until I live chat with one of their representatives. This is not a requirement for any other product purchased on Amazon and shouldn_ be for the Echo just because it is owned by them. If I can somehow get Amazon to give me my money back I_l try another one to see if it_ defective or just a poor product, otherwise it_l go in the trash and I_l switch to Google Mini.",1
5,"3rd Gen Dot is Fantastic - Nice job Amazon
  
",10.Dec.18,Yes,"I was originally going to purchase a CD player, but I realized I could get significantly more functionality for less money with the Dot playing over Bluetooth. I can_ think of any music I was unable to find on Amazon music or my other music services. The Dot is a high quality device that I will use every day in my office. The price is amazing even when not on sale. Once again Amazon surpassed my expectations. I now have a gen 1 Echo, Echo Spot, and Echo Dot. They are all slightly different, but all are great and used daily in my home. I highly recommend all these devices, but the Dot offers the same features with a smaller price tag.",0
4,"Bass, more bass and no subwoofer.
  
",10.Dec.18,Yes,"I like this unit much more that the Gen 2 units, but there are a couple of reasons it doesn't get 5 stars. First and foremost, the amount of bass is overkill and there is no adjustment for it. I love bass, but this is just too much. Second is the fact that gen 2 units can do stereo and add the subwoofer. This one cannot. Still the sound is far superior to just a single gen 2 dot and I will keep it hoping there are revisions in the future.",1
5,"OMG!  What a useful gadget!
  
",10.Dec.18,Yes,"This was my first entry into voice activated house help (previously used only Ok, Google...."" for directions in the car.)  I read the reviews and had to order one. After hooking it up in the bedroom, I could see just how useful these can be.  I intended to use it to turn on the radio in the morning and to control a couple lamps in the house but after a couple days, I ordered two more. I live in a three-floor house and hate running up and down the stairs when Alexa could help.  It's like having a very, very polite and helpful maid. This would also be useful for folks who have a hard time getting around their house.",0
3,"Usability could be better
  
",10.Dec.18,Yes,This is primarily used for music. It does sound better than the 2nd generation but it_ still just OK as far as sound quality is concerned. I have it connected to a Sonos Play One which sounds very good. The bad thing is that you still can_ include Sonos speakers in  groups created in the Alexa app. Another thing is that sometimes  Amazon music will only play one song at a time when I request a station or playlist.,1
3,"Just ok.
  
",10.Dec.18,Yes,"For the price, not too bad, but I get better usability on a day to day basis from other devices of it's kind. This constantly jams up on me when playing music; it will often only play a single song from  my playlists or simply not understand what I am asking. It's a bit of a dumb, smart device and I wish I had gone with something else.The speaker is pretty good though and it is feature rich once you get it dialed down. I use it primarily for music and it  rarely understands my commands, or doesn't hear me at all and when it does, it just stops randomly for no reason that I can discern.",0
5,"Top notch smart speaker for the money. Way better than the 2nd gen Dot.
  
",10.Dec.18,Yes,"Freaking fantastic and it's a bargain at the holiday price. If you got it for the black Friday price, it's a steal. It took a bit of time getting it set up on AT&amp;T Uverse, but once I looked it up, it was pretty easy. The sound quality over the second gen dot isn't even comparable. Way better sound over the 2nd gen Dot. Mic is also way better at recognizing your voice. After giving a demo to my dad, they'll definitely be getting one for Christmas. He was very impressed. I haven't tried any other smart speakers, but I'd have a tough time imagining the competitors in this price range could be any better.",0
5,"At least try this!  It's as simple as just an Internet connection _
  
",10.Dec.18,Yes,The only reason I'm sharing the next part is so it's understandable just the ease of use this product is!  I've have a small amount of brain damage due to an accident.  This is not only easy to use but WONDERFUL!  I stopped listening to music because I had trouble with setting things up but this puts off a perfect sound.  I live in an apartment so surround sound wouldn't work.  I compared this dot 3rd generation to a small Bose I used to have.  But don't get me wrong I love Bose and naturally gravitate to that product line.  I love it and might get 1 for my sister!  She never treats herself and this is not expensive _,0
3,"It works okay but still have some ways to go...
  
",10.Dec.18,Yes,Well Alexa is responsive but not all the time. The wisper doesn_ work and if you ask her the time when the volume is high at 2 in the morning she_l wake up the house. Even when follow up question mode is enabled it doesn_ work very well ...... everything else works fine. Installing the Echo Dot was a bit tricky but the Alexa app works better now. I forgot to mention that the light on the unit itself should have an on and off as it_ very disturbing at 3 in the morning if it_ updating and your trying to sleep.,0
5,"Sound is much better.
  
",10.Dec.18,Yes,"I love it.  The sound is much better than 2nd generation echo dot.  Still want to add a speaker for music.  Hooking up dot was easier. I love the quality they put into this with the bigger speakers, and it's heavier, which give it more bass.  I just ordered another one rather than 2nd gen because of the sound improvemt.Bought anotherone.  So easy to install!  The one thing I noticed.  Alexa picks up my voice better with Echo Dot 2nd gen. Bought another one to paird with another echo dot for stero sound.",0
5,"small but mighty
  
",10.Dec.18,Yes,"I have this device  that can just about everything by my bed. Alexa is great for giving information, queing up my song list from either Amazon music, Spotify or Sirius radio. I received this device as a gift for my subscription to Sirius, did not know what to expect but it sure is one of the best unexpected gifts I have ever received.",1
1,"Junk. Does not work with Alexa streaming in 2 rooms. I disconnected dot &amp; Alexa is fine again.
  
",10.Dec.18,Yes,Nothing but problems trying to play two rooms streaming same music. Dot does not work. Music on main Alexa just stops playing. Always when dot was added. Never before.dot skipped in and out no matter where I put it.  I disconnected dot and my main Alexa works fine again.Dot was faulty from day one. Does not play well with Alexa.I play music 24/7. It stopped working when I added dot. I spent hours on phone with tech support. Nothing worked.,0
5,"Nifty little gadget!
  
",10.Dec.18,Yes,"We love this thing! Easy to set up, and fun to play with. The kids can call grandma and papa on their own, which is nifty. The kids also like being able to pull up the music they want to hear.Seems like it will be useful too.I never knew I wanted one until it came free with my blink camera. The sound quality is also impressive for such a tiny little device! Can't wait to see what else it can do.I already ordered my mom one, and my older son is getting the kid version for Christmas.My only suggestion would be better options for controlling a Roku.",0
5,"Very Impressive and great quality
  
",11.Dec.18,Yes,"I have been an Apple buyer for many years, and never would have considered purchasing anything electronic from Amazon for control of my electronics. I still only use iPhones, iPad, Mac, Apple tv, etc., but I am very impressed with the build quality, the price, the packaging and skills of Alexa. I cannot even get the Siri on my phone to answer me! I have now used products with Alexa in my thermostats and purchased plugs to control other electronic devices such as light in the home. It is very easy to install, and Alexa continues to add skills which makes the product a better value. It even lets you add your Amazon account to purchase products and listen to Amazon music just by talking to it. I am surprised Apple allowed or sat back and let Amazon pass it up significantly with Alexa as in my opinion, Siri doesn't come close, and I am an Apple loyal customer. Also, the sound quality is quite good for such a small little speaker, which is amazing considering everything this does, and the price being as low as it is during the holiday sales.",2
5,"Awesome little device!!
  
",11.Dec.18,Yes,"I'm not a techie by ANY means.  I'm also disabled and only have use of one hand.  Setting up the Echo Dot was super simple until it came to getting the app and registering my unit.  The app would NOT allow me to log into Amazon.  I contacted Amazon and chatted with a CS rep who helped me to do it on their site.  Took a while but after it found and connected to my WiFi I was able to unplug the Dot and move it into another room and she's been chatting away with me ever since.  I have to be careful because I was on the telephone telling my aunt about A L E X A and she started talking to me.  I found I have to spell it if I want to discuss her.  (Humor here!!)  Also if I use talk to chat on my cell.  She wants to know what I want....  I'm having a ball!  I listened to music this morning.  I've gotten the weather, time and back to music.  So far I'm ecstatic.  Let's see if I need to do an update or if this review stands in a week or two!  At this point I would highly recommend her.  The sound from the speaker is fantastic for such a small thing.  I receive the Dot included when I purchased my Ring2 doorbell.  Amazon has it as a package and I got the better end of the deal!!!  Go for it if you are in doubt!",2
5,"Cheerio, Alexa!
  
",11.Dec.18,Yes,"Works as advertised, sound is better than I expected (based on size and price) and with a little research and tinkering, I had a smart home in no time (bulbs, plugs, etc.). However, if I had the extra funds and the Black Friday sale price were a tad lower, I would've bought the Echo Plus due to it's built-in 'smart hub,' meaning I could have used various other smart devices together without having to purchase their hubs as well.Only drawback for me is the voice recognition when asking Alexa to play my Spotify playlists-- to be fair, my playlist names are unconventional and I have discovered that the simpler the name the better. Also-- don't use punctuation and words not germane to the dialect you've chosen in the language settings (Indian accent, UK, etc.). No stars off for renaming playlists, just a lesson learned.On a side note, if you set Alexa to Australian/New Zealand accent and then, in your infinte jest, ask her to 'put another shrimp on the barbie,' she will absolutely let you know how she feels about that hackneyed and clichéd stereotype. Good on ya, Alexa.",1
1,"The alexa app is garbage, it doesn't do what they claim!
  
",11.Dec.18,Yes,"The alexa app is trash. It will not connect to other amazon alexa devices, claims it needs skills added even though the app claims they already are. It has been a constant fight, it has me ready to throw it out the door. If you enjoy going in circles for hours with the Alaxa app not responding and the echo not doing what it claims it does. Give the Echo to people you don't like it will raise their blood pressure! I don't recommend! I had a message from Amazon they called while I was at work wanting to know I left the review I did. Because it does NOT support Firetv devices at all! It will make you mad trying to enable Firetv it does not work. Alexa is ok for other things but I will not spend a lot on anything they claim is enabled since they lie about what the devices do. Customer service has been a joke lately!",1
5,"Big Improvement in sound quality over older Dot gen 2
  
",11.Dec.18,Yes,"I didn't mind the small size and low sound quality of the older Dot gen 2 for the bedroom to set a wakeup alarm or ask what time it is in the middle of the night without needing to turn on a light or even listen to the news with the flash briefing either before bed or upon waking up. I even enjoyed the ambient sleep sounds to help me block out noisy neighbors when falling asleep.So I didn't expect much more from the 3rd generation of the Dot, and I liked the fact it had a 3.5mm audio output so I could connect it to a set of powered speakers if I needed to, however I was pleasantly surprised to hear the increased volume and especially bass in this 3rd gen Dot.I ordered a few of them on Cyber Monday to pair them as stereo pairs in the kitchen and they seem better sounding to me than the original Alexa Echo I had in the kitchen, maybe it's because of the stereo or that one is in one corner of kitchen and the other is in the other side?Regardless I am really enjoying the purchases and since moved my lower sounding Dot gen 2 to the bathroom where loud music isn't needed.I highly recommend the Dot Gen 3's for all over the house.Get them on sale in pairs and you'll find you won't even need to listen to them at half the volume setting.:)",0
5,"Alexa is my new best friend
  
",11.Dec.18,Yes,"This device came with my ring doorbell and at first I though meh I'll probably use it here and there. But let me tell you, once you fall down the rabbit hole it's great. One of my favorite things is syncing it with my Roku remote. That way in the middle of a lazy binge watching session I can just have Alexa press continue for me. The potential for full on laziness is fantastic! I didn't know I could play games with her until the other day and then I spent a good chunk of my Sunday playing the song quiz game. I just ordered some Philips hue bulbs and can't wait to get that setup. I also connected my Spotify account with it and was surprised with the sound quality. We only got one in our bundle with Ring but we already ordered another one for the house. We are slowly but surely becoming a house that filled with robots and I couldn't be happier!",0
5,"Feel like I'm cheating on ..............
  
",11.Dec.18,Yes,"Love this device.  Didn't really want to purchase because I consider myself ""living in the Orchard"" with all our  Products. The one thing I find annoying about my Siri is that sometimes I have to pick the phone up to continue and when you're cooking or doing something where your hands are tied up - its just inconvenient.  No more - Alexa works seamlessly with my iPhone and I love it!After visiting a friend who was sick and I don't even know how the conversation began, she asked this little dot to do look up something and ""Voila"" I was hooked.  The sound of music coming from this little thing is amazinggggggggg - I live in a condo and I always wear headphones pretty much or play music through tv.  No more - without additional speaker hook up, this little dot plays like the big boys (of course its not surround) but buy some more dots and there you go.Stop reading this and buy it all ready and to my fellow peeps in the Orchard - go ahead, they'll never know. lol",0
4,"Better Sound, Small Differences
  
",11.Dec.18,Yes,"There are a couple things that I have noticed about this new version. First, you will not be able to use it with some accessories, like certain wall plug holders or any device that depends on the diameter to be like version 2. The diameter is larger and the periphery has the speaker grille which cannot be covered up obviously. Secondly, the audio level, compared to gen 2 is lower. If you have routines that set the audio level or if you use voice commands to set the level, you will need to adjust upward to achieve the same audio level. My routine that sets the level to 2 needed to be increased to level 4 for the same loudness. I believe this applies to the Bluetooth level as well, which the Dot remembers separately. Not a big deal, just different.",0
4,"Power supply hogs outlet.
  
",11.Dec.18,Yes,"I like the new look. I will fit in room decor easier. The sound quality is much better than the earlier model, which is the only reason I will keep this one.The power supply (wall charger), has a larger ""foot print"" and tends to hog the plug outlet, especially the location of the exit point of the cord, not allowing anything else to be plugged in next to it. Also, the cord is permanently attached to the power supply, not allowing the same flexibility of using the traditional USB plug, for routing the wire. I'm assuming that is because the new model has more power needs than the previous models, and they want to be sure we use only the original power cord.So, I will keep this 3rd generation Dot, but I won't be replacing my 2nd generation dots any time soon.",0
4,"ALEXA ?  IS THIS FOR YOU ?
  
",11.Dec.18,Yes,"A Notch up from the last Generation.  Great concept,Great product. Dose have its pro's and con's. Let's start with the Pro's : The sound quality greatly improved,although it dose have bluetooth that enables you to connect to near by bluetooth speakers, output jack port for direct plug in also.  Very handy for general information, asking date and time, setting alarms and reminders from both the unit itself or your cell phone.  Businesses time of operations,location and phone number, weather,general technical or historical information: spelling,mathematic ,measurement and weight conversions, geographical statistics as some examples. Plays music on demand from play lists ,unit to unit calling or even calls to your contacts or even your phone if lost/missplaced. Smart home integration with some devices and appliances,sometimes with aid of a specialized seperate device.Cons : My biggest issue is the inconsistentency of its listening ability.My opinion: Over all great product and concept . I just hope that software updates continue and hardware updates with newer technology continue as newer models are released.",0
5,"Love this echo
  
",11.Dec.18,Yes,"My family is new to the world of Alexa but so far we are loving this echo!!! I love to just voice command a genre of music and have it play a station while I am in the middle of cooking, if I don't like a song while stiring a pan on the stove top, I just tell Alexa to skip to the next song . I had ordered a smart plug with it so I can control my Christmas tree lights, I just tell Alexa to turn them off and on, no more plugging and unplugging. My daughter loves that if I run to the grocery store she can call me using the Echo Dot, this feature alone is worth the cost for kids to connect with family without tying up their parents phone, for my children the call quality is much better than them fidgeting with a cell phone using speaker phone. Between festive music while cooking or kids having dance parties, we all are enjoying the convenience of Alexa with this Echo Dot. I highly recommend having one in your kitchen or any frequently used room. Next I want to get one for the bathroom, how nice it will be to voice command songs to play or check the weather while in the shower.",0
5,"Best amazon device ever
  
",11.Dec.18,Yes,I love this device more than most of my other amazon devices.  I am so excited it will work with apple music starting december 17th!!!!  this made my day when i found that out.  I had an echo gen 2 and this way out performs it and is way cheaper!!!!  I love this so much i ordered a second one.  I have sandstone and love how it looks feels and sounds.  Good job amazon.  Update:  I got a new amazon echo dot with clock and love it so much more! $10 more was worth it because I always forget to ask alexa the time or weather.  I put it where I always look and I must say I love it more...more than I could have ever imagine,0
5,"Love this!
  
",11.Dec.18,Yes,"I love this small Alexa speaker.  The sound on it is very clear and crisp.  It fills an average to large size room with a good amount of sound without being turned up to full volume.  I have a previous edition and this new one has improved so much.  I also have the Echo speaker and a couple other Alexa devices, they all sync up and play together nicely with hardly no lag when adding a new room.I got this speaker mainly for use in my daughters room to go with her ipad instead of a pricey bluetooth speaker.  I am really happy I did.  It works great and does enough functions to keep busy.",0
5,"Best device i have purchased for 30 bucks.
  
",11.Dec.18,Yes,"I'm a tech savvy person so i decided to buy a digital assistant and decided to go with Alexa! Glad i did, for 30 dollars you get tons of features and if you have Amazon prime it's even 10x better. Before i made the move on buying one i really didn't really try one, so i went in blind and it was good enough for me to buy 2 of them :) i bought them from bestbuy since if oyu buy 2 you get 10 dollars off.The audio is Loud and clear (remember this is 30 dollars) plays anything I throw at it, I have a slight accent and didn't have to train Alexa she understands everything I say even when I'm half asleep. You can ask Alexa pretty much anything and she will have an answer. People say Google assistant is smarter but to me Alexa with Amazon Prime is the perfect choice.",0
5,"She_ cool!
  
",11.Dec.18,Yes,"She_ pretty cool. We got the dot for free when we purchased the Ring Doorbell 2. She_ in the living room. My kids like asking her things (they are 5 and 7) but sometimes I have to tell them to leave her alone. I typically just listen to the local radio station all day when I_ home by myself (I work from home). I don_ think we_e tapped all her capabilities yet but I especially love that I can connect her to my OurGroceries app and can just ask her to add to it. Best thing ever. She can answer the Ring doorbell too. If it comes for free with whatever your buying, it_ worth it. Heck she_ probably worth the money too. Enjoy!",0
5,"Alexa at home
  
",11.Dec.18,Yes,"I finally decided to get an Echo Dot with its compact size, improved sound quality, and the reduced price during the Black Friday sales. I am still learning about its capabilities and uses but have been using it listen to iHeart radio, and to control my Wemo light switches. So far, it has worked with no problems and sits quietly on my desk most of the time. The voice recognition surprised me when it reacted to a YouTube video that said the word ""Alexa."" There are many skills that can be added to Alexa through the App.",0
2,"2nd Gen is Better
  
",11.Dec.18,Yes,"I'm disappointed with this new model. I have three of the second generation dots and they are much better except for sound quality. Sound quality is all that this one does better.The 3rd generation is somehow much slower than the 2nd one. It takes a bit for Alexa to register my voice and my subsequent request. The permanent power cord is a disappointment too. I already miss the USB cord that came with the previous ones. Finally, I've never had so many problems connecting a Bluetooth speaker. It never can work.Overall, I'm very disappointed.",0
4,"Setup is the devil, Alexa is an angel
  
",11.Dec.18,Yes,"I'd honestly give this 5 stars, but the setup process was so infuriating I almost returned it. But after 20 unsuccessful attempts to connect my wifi to Alexa, and 5 unhelpful articles later, the wifi finally connected. I didn't do anything different, didn't change my position from the router. Nothing. It just decided to work that one time. But after all that she works really good. Very helpful with my sengled lights, and I love hearing the weather forecast while getting dressed.",0
5,"Kids love it!
  
",11.Dec.18,Yes,"The whole family loves this device! She's very responsive and has no trouble recognizing words. My kids have used her to tell stories, jokes, and just to answer silly questions. I use her for ordering products and just keeping up with my everyday schedule. Want to know the weather? She can tell you. Want to control your Wi-Fi outlet? She can do that as well. I will buying another since I have a kid that wants to take the Echo to his friends house every time he spends the night.",0
2,"Very disappointed
  
",12.Dec.18,Yes,"Bought this because I needed a new Bluetooth speaker for listening to Spotify, and figured I'd give Alexa a shot because it was on sale for about the same price as a regular Bluetooth speaker, but with extra features. Read that the Dot didn't have the same sound quality as the full-size Echo, but my previous Bluetooth speaker was an itty bitty, cheap, inch-high pocket-size thing, so I figured surely the sound quality would be at least as good as that one was (it had surprisingly crisp, clear sound for such a tiny thing). I was wrong. The music sounds weird and muffled on the Dot, like someone tossed a heavy blanket over the speaker; not even close to decent quality, and trying to adjust the bass/treble didn't improve things. Furthermore, it won't link to my Spotify account, as it apparently requires you to have Spotify *Premium*, which I have no interest in paying for, and this bit of fine print was not mentioned anywhere in the item description when I bought it. So basically, it is completely useless for the entire purpose I bought it for. I initially figured that if I didn't like the Dot, I'd return it and save for the full-size Echo, but as that one presumably won't let me listen to my free Spotify account either, I think I am just going to return it and go with a regular old, non-smart Bluetooth speaker instead -- one that will let me listen to what I want, with decent sound quality and no stipulations. Very disappointing... I was really looking forward to using this. The only reason this doesn't get one star is because I'm sure it does everything else it's supposed to do just fine; I didn't bother to test those features out though, once I realized it wasn't going to perform the primary task that I wanted it to.",0
5,"Amazing!!!! Quite impressive. It is worth the money!!!
  
",12.Dec.18,Yes,"Right out of the box I hooked it up with no problem. I do like the power cable for not being a USB connection. I have a 2nd generation dot that would become unplugged especially useing a power supply.I have been using as before mention for nearly a year. I have noticed how flat the sound is. It would cause you to realize or wonder if the sound is down mixed to one channel. It is more for reading than anything else. Its day is over.From the instance you plug it in Alexa's voice sounds fuller than being spoken though a muffled small speaker. Soon after hooking it up I by chance played instrumental music to balance the sound. The sound is like listening in a restraunt to add an ambiance setting. I also listen to a  kindle booK, her voice was clear than 2nd gen. Otherwise it sounds as a real person is speaking. It's not as someone is speaking from a distance. As stated, I ballaced the sound : base, mid, treb to get it sounding smoothly. I am impressed for a good reason.  It is something that can be used at a party but also doesn't need to be turned up if used in the kitchen. Keep in mind, the environment does effect the sound so adjust to it. The volume can be turned up loud but who wants to. The voice does ""hangs on"" the louder it gets. The volume does get to the point of being annoying.",0
5,"Big Improvement
  
",12.Dec.18,Yes,"I've owned a 2nd-generation Echo Dot for a couple of years. Although I was pretty happy with it, I felt this one might offer an improvement in audio quality. So I moved the old one to another room, and purchased one of these to replace it. I have to say this 3rd-gen Dot provides a significant improvement in sound quality.  It's a little bigger, and a little heavier, but now there's some ACTUAL bass. It's not really good bass, and it's not really loud bass, or even clear bass -- but dammit, there's bass now where there had been none.  Enough that you can actually follow a musical bass line now. And it can play louder, too. You can also adjust the tone using audio equalizer settings in your phone's Alexa app, which I've done.  Overall, I think this device about splits the sound quality difference between the Gen 2 and the larger Echo (non-Dot). Don't hesitate to buy one of these for streaming music or radio, as long as you don't need too much volume and are not using this as your primary musical listening device.",0
5,"Great sound
  
",12.Dec.18,Yes,"I love the new design.. setup is very easy it connects itself .. works great and it is really smooth on my nightstand perfect match next to my echo show 2 .. when i play music it fills up the room .. and sometimes when the show 2's screen is off i don't even know where the music coming from .. from the dot ? Or from the echo show 2 ?  ..The new echo dot is well made great design ,and looks good in my bedroom .. you won't have trouble to place it .. it looks good in the kitchen in the bathroom ,bedroom ,or livingroom ..",1
2,"Stick with an Echo
  
",12.Dec.18,Yes,"REALLY disappointed in so many ways with this. 1st off, I've setup 2 Echos in my home &amp; it was easy &amp; done automatically for the most part. Tried to set this Dot up using the Alexa app on a brand new Android phone &amp; it forced me to setup in MANUAL mode &amp; on top of that wouldn't complete the process. Tried multiple times doing different things following their steps &amp; it wouldn't work. Finally had to use my laptop &amp; it's Alexa app to set the wifi connection up manually. Should be working correctly out of the box...not create a headache.2nd, the audio is no where near as loud as either Echo device at max volume. Very disappointed on so many fronts. I'm giving the Dot as a gift &amp; hope it doesn't come back to haunt me.",0
4,"Update from the 2nd Generation
  
",12.Dec.18,Yes,"The 3rd generation Dot has some improvements.1) The sound quality is better than my 2nd generation Dot.  I still won't listen to music on it (without an external speaker) but the sound is improved in both frequency response and volume.2) The appearance is more pleasing to me than the stark black puck that is the 2nd generation Dot.The disappointment is that the new Dot requires the provided power supply...I can't just plug in into a USB port for power.  So, yet another ""dongle"" is added to the mass of wires/plugs/dongles that seem to go with electronics today.I recommend getting the new Dot rather than the old for the advantages above.  And living with the dongle.",0
2,"New and Improved, but less universal...
  
",12.Dec.18,Yes,"So the new Echo Dot has improved sound quality over the 2nd generation dot. The bass is a bit richer, and overall sound is better. The unit is slightly larger, and has a new design. That being said, I'm not at all a fan of the fabric outside; the only thing that accomplishes is making it look more like the Google Home.  Now, the real and true killer of this device, and the reason it's only getting 2 stars, is the lack of USB power. I understand the slightly larger speaker may require power above 5v, though I'm not sure that's the reason.. However, I now need some proprietary cable to power the unit.. I may be returning it, and getting another 2nd generation dot instead.",0
5,"Highly Recommended
  
",12.Dec.18,Yes,"This little guy is my first Echo device, and I love it.ProsThe sound from the speakers is amazing. My music can fill my room easily. On 10% volume, I can hear my music quite well and little to no sound can be heard from outside my door.It is placed about a foot from my bed. This device can hear me quite well, even when I whisper to it at night or in the early morning.It's very portable, however, I don't recommend bringing it everywhere I go, simply because it is not meant to be taken everywhere. If you do want to take it places, for some reason, go ahead?Brought it to my work before. Even with the loud environment, it still heard me and my coworkers well (most of the time.)Has plenty of fun stuff (like Easter eggs and games) and useful tools (like checking weather and alarms).The commands are always quick, unless it has trouble hearing you (which only happened in loud environments.)ConsRequires the ""Alexa App"" to work. The connection is quite easy, but it's the app itself is the problem. It can be ridiculously slow at times, or even buggy. However, the app is needed to add routines and lists via phone.",0
3,"Nice sound. Not the smartest
  
",12.Dec.18,Yes,Own a few Google Home Speakers and I feel that Echo 3rd generation speakers sound better than home mini. The home mini was better than the 2nd generation echo though. Ok now the bad part. Echo is not as smart as Home mini when it comes to responding to basic questions like singing some nursery rhymes for my baby. One thing that I don_ like is it doesn_  have a physical stop button like the google mini has; you can just tap on it and it will stop. This one doesn_ have that so if I have to stop it without shouting alexa stop I am out of luck.,0
5,"Echo Dot 3
  
",12.Dec.18,Yes,"I had to get help to connect to wifi as I'm not familiar with how to do things like that but once I had Alexa up and going I've loved it.  My purpose was to see if there were sounds like rain or storms that would help me to sleep but after I was connected to the music, I fell in love with it.  I'm a traditional country fan and was happy with what I was able to listen to.  My young Granddaughter loves more modern songs so we will play games, first she chooses a song, then I do.  I know there's still more to learn with my Echo Dot 3 and I can't wait.",0
4,"Good sound, easy understanding.
  
",12.Dec.18,Yes,"I just recieved this today. Imholding out on the fifth star because I havent gotten to try everything out or use it much. But so far I can comment on the sound and the reaction time of alexa. First of all,this thing is loud at full volume. Which is great. I have no problem understanding the music that is playing or what alexa is saying. And as for alexa, the skills offered are awesome. Ive only tried a couple out but the two that I have tried worked great. My daughter played a guess the animal game and tried to trick alexa by choosing a human and alexa got it. It seems to understand what we say just fine as well. Before I can even finish saying alexa stop it stops. So predictive reaction is phoenominal for that.",0
4,"A Question of Balance
  
",12.Dec.18,Yes,"The most important feature of devices like this is sound quality and here_ where the dot 3 disappoints. The dot 2 had too much treble and while excellent for verbal it was inadequate for music. The dot 3 is the exact opposite - too much bass for verbal but a richer and deeper sound for music. What is needed is an equalizer to achieve the right balance.Update: To its credit, Amazon tech support called me informing me of an equalizer setting in the app. This improved the sound quality!",0
5,"Small footprint - big sound
  
",12.Dec.18,Yes,"I love the echo dots, I have several of them along with a Video Show. Alexa is everywhere in my home. The dots size is great, does not have a large footprint and is very unobtrusive. The only con I found with the latest one, it has a fabric cover.  I had planned on having this one in the kitchen, but traded it out with the one on the night stand. Thinking the fabric will pick up and hold the kitchen odors and or grease, making it difficult to keep clean.",0
5,"Easy connection to streaming
  
",12.Dec.18,Yes,"I debated purchasing because I couldn't decide between echo or dot. I read many reviews and finally decided on the dot. I live in a small condo so the dot is perfect for my bedroom. I'm so happy with the performance of this little hockey puck! It's small but for my purposes perfect. Sound quality is fantastic, I use iheartradio to stream music and I've not had the volume above 5, produces rich, clear tones. I love having music at my command! Have to try this amazing new device with the home plug next. I've been so happy I didn't want to stop long enough to hook the adapter up, lol! Also hooked it up to myaudio pet Bluetooth speakers. Easy peasy, no problems and it sounded even better.",0

1,"Not nearly as good as previous generation. No need to updgrade!
  
",13.Dec.18,Yes,"I bought two of these and am super disappointed with them. I have them in the same room with two of the 2nd Generation Echo dots and I am CONSISTENTLY about 1-2 feet away from the new (3rd Gen) version and about 6-8 feet away from the 2nd Gen one and the 2nd Gen is the one to answer my questions. SUPER annoying.After a few weeks of me second guessing (""did that really just happen?"" I finally called into the support line and got outsourced to who knows where and the rep was extremely uninterested in helping me figure out what is going on, and sounded annoyed that I was even calling in about the issue. NOT a good experience. Adding insult to injury.  I'll call back tomorrow and see if I can get an English speaking rep and if I can't get some resolution- these are going to get sent back. Bummer. I SO wanted to love these newer versions. They just can't hear you as well as the old ones apparently.",4
2,"Have issues?  Just send it back!
  
",13.Dec.18,Yes,"I tried to to do the right thing.  Our entire home is connected to the Amazon ecosystem and dependent on the Dot as our main hub.  The 3rd gen was failing to respond so I called tech support and after an hour on the phone nothing had changed.  They wanted to start a repair ticket and it will take up to three days for a response.  So now my automated home is on it's knees since I'm unable to use Alexa to control functions.  Now, if tech support determines it's to be replaced, I'll have to wait even longer for a replacement for a device still under warranty!  Next time I will just start a return and have a new one in two days.  Not impressed Amazon, you need to rethink how you handle your adapters of your tech when they have invested time and money into your system.",2
5,"Life changing. I'm thrilled
  
",13.Dec.18,Yes,"I love my Echo Dot 3rd Gen. I didn't know what I was missing until I helped my neighbor set hers up. We ran into a problem interfacing with Pandora until we discovered they moved that from Music to Skills and Games. Once we set Pandora up I was jumping up and down at the possibilities.Alexa now keeps my grocery list for me. I feel like I just gained hours a day and never forget to add something. No more getting up in the middle of the night to make a note, no more stopping what I'm doing to add to the list,...Yikes, this is heaven.I'm totally content with the speaker quality. It's much better than my phone or laptop. I'm going to add more Echo dots after reading other reviews.I bought 2 smart plugs so I can turn an uplight and space heater on independently. So far no problems.  I've only scratched the surface of possibilities.  There is no going back.Oh yeah.  I'm using Amazon Smart Plugs. I tried a smart plug from another manufacturer and experienced some problems.",1
4,"Sounds great
  
",13.Dec.18,Yes,"I am really impressed with the 3rd-generation Echo Dot. It sounds MUCH better than the previous models; in fact, it sounds almost as good as a full-size generation 2 Echo, just with less bass. For audio where the bass isn't as important (e.g. classical orchestra, audiobooks, or voice calls), I don't even notice the difference in bass unless I'm thinking about it.Put another way, the 3rd-gen Dot sounds good enough that your average user probably won't feel the need to connect it to an external speaker.The third generation is also much better looking than the second generation, due to the fabric cover. It looks classy just about anywhere you put it.My only major complaint is that the Echo Dot's microphones aren't as good as the full-size Echo. The 2nd-gen Echo has 7 microphone holes and can understand me no matter where I am, how much background noise there is, or how loudly I'm talking. The 3rd-gen Echo Dot, on the other hand, only has more microphone holes, and seems to have trouble hearing me if I'm too far away, not facing it directly, or there is too much background noise (including noise coming from its own speakers).I do think the standard retail price of $50 is a bit of a ripoff, but the sale price of $30 is a good value.",0
5,"Wow.  Just wow.
  
",13.Dec.18,Yes,"I am VERY impressed with this device.  I've got 4 of the 2nd generation Echo Dots, and this new 3rd generation positively blows them away.  This Dot actually puts out some noticeable bass - the 2nd gen had absolutely none.  Instead of sounding like an intercom speaker, this one can be used to enjoy music as well as all the other features.Now, it's not going to replace your larger Echo devices in the sound department, but for putting next to a computer or listening to from the nightstand, this Dot is ideal.  I used to love the versatility of the 2nd gen, and still do, but this one has all of that and enough sound to impress.I purchased the sandstone flavor, and find it to be rather sharp looking, but neutral enough to blend into it's surroundings and not stick out.Bottom line:  This is quite an amazing device and a huge value.  There is absolutely no way to go wrong with one of these.  You get all the features of the full-size Echo in the size of a hearty hockey puck.  Again, I'm amazed with the sound that comes out of this little thing.",0
1,"Disappointing
  
",13.Dec.18,Yes,"I bought it hoping for it to have more functionality than my Google Home Mini.  Instead of just saying ""I don't know how to help you with that"" like the Google Home Mini,  the Amazon Echo Dot will read long sections of wikipedia pages unrelated to the question asked.  After getting an Amazon delivery, the Echo Dot lit up yellow.  I asked the Echo Dot many questions about how to remove the yellow light.  It was only able to tell me to disable the notification in the app on my phone.  After disabling the notification in the phone app, the yellow light remained.  After searching online and finding nothing, I repeating asked the Echo Dot to remove the yellow light with different wording until ""Remove all notifications"" worked.  It is unbelievable how precise my words had to be to do this.  Why was it not able to help me do this quicker?  The Echo Dot's text to speech is also no where near as human sounding as with the Google Home Mini.  I would say the Google Home Mini is mildly useful and the Echo Dot is even less useful.",1
5,"So Glad I Finally Brought Alexa Into The Home
  
",13.Dec.18,Yes,"This is my first echo product. We have had 4 Fire TVs/ sticks and love every one of them. I've been on the fence about the Dot and I'm glad I jumped on this one. I got a great deal with the Hue Lights bundle. Set up took less than a minute. I've read many reviews and noticed that many had qualms with sound quality. I have none. For a small device, it puts out a lot of sound. Bass is lacking, but that doesn't matter to me. It's an Echo Dot, not a Bose or JBL system. I can hear it from my living room to my kitchen. Picks up commands well from my husband, 3 year old and myself. Alexa is fun. She does an okay job with the Hue lights with simple commands. I mostly use the hue app unless I ask her to dim, turn on or off, or brighten. Haven't manage to get more than that. Well worth the sale price or the full retail price.",0
5,"Great for lazy people.
  
",13.Dec.18,Yes,"Getting this echo dot set up was sort of my first step toward creating a _mart home environment. I do not yet have the special outlets, light bulbs, and other devices for Alexa to control. So far, i like being able to ask Alex to play SOME (free) music, on command. Alexa can also answer SOME questions. I can tell that it would be handy to be able to control other devices, using this Alexa assistant.",2
5,"Much better sound and look than previous gen.
  
",13.Dec.18,Yes,I'm very happy with upgrading to the 3rd gen Dot.  I could tell when I opened the package the speaker had been improved by just the weight of the Dot.Improvements --Sound - Definitely the sound quality has been improved.  I really enjoy using my Dot to play music.  The improved speaker has won me over.-Appearance - I personally feel the new look is much more attractive.  The softer curve and the fabric shell make it fit better with a variety of different décor.  The other benefit of the curve is that the notification light can easily be seen now.  Previous gens had the light on the top and you couldn't see it if it was placed high.Overall I give this 5 stars and a big improvement over the previous gen Dots.,0
5,"It_ like having an invisible personal assistant in the room with you!!
  
",13.Dec.18,Yes,I got the echo dot 3 with a smart plug and plugged my Xmas tree into the plug and I use Alexa to program when my Xmas tree lights turn on and off and I can also just ask Alexa to turn on or off my smart plug. That alone is worth it! Using My echo dot 3 for so many other things. It_ like having an invisible personal assistant in the room with you. Don_ have to teach for pen and paper or my phone and open my notes app anymore!! I just ask Alexa to add to my shopping list or remove an item and it_ done! My husband can even play rock paper scissor with Alexa! And we both love the sleep sounds every night our favorite is city rain! My husband was joking around and asked Alexa _hat do I do about my stomach ache today alexa rattled off a list of things! We looked at each other like wow pretty cool! I_ going to order another smart plug maybe 2 and also get my husband his own echo dot 3 to put in his home office so he_l leave my personal assistant (Alexa) alone. Lol then we_l have one on each end of our house :) definitely definitely would recommend!,0
5,"Caution
  
",13.Dec.18,Yes,"I recently purchased a Roku TV (which I luv BTW) and felt it was a perfect addition. Being on a budget after buying the TV and based on reviews these were perfect. Arrived quickly (thanks Amazon) and hit a little snag. Enter my word of caution. I went to the website and as so many companies provide, I used the chat help. Long story short.... he did not help me at all... what he did was try to confuse me and get me to buy his services for $200. Don_ fall for this ploy. And then he got nasty and hung up on me. So I went on yo fix the issue myself in 5 minutes. Be warned...And I really really enjoy the speakers. Good sound and being so used to Siri I am having a blast with Alexa. And you certainly can_ beat the price",0
3,"Hopefully not the new normal for the Echo Dots.
  
",13.Dec.18,Yes,"This is our second Echo Dot, the first was a 2nd gen.While the sound and music is far better on the 3rd gen, we are not as pleased with it, as we were with the first one.With our first Echo, it was very easy for Alexa to hear command prompts, even from the next room and at regular speaking volume.  After having this new Dot for a couple of weeks, we have found that if we are in the next room, or if there is any ambient noise, Alexa can't hear us at normal levels.  Even yelling sometimes is not picked up and we have to move to the same room to get a response.We're purchasing a third Echo for our bedroom, we're hoping that this Dot is just defective and not the new norm for them.We were very disappointed after enjoying our first one so much.",0
5,"Great sound and features out of this little puck - great upgrade to the original Dot
  
",13.Dec.18,Yes,"So I have the original Echo as well as an Echo dot. Love them both and get a lot of use out of them. The Dot is in my bathroom and I get the news in the morning as well as listen to music while I shower.This new Dot blows the old dot out of the water. The sound quality is night and day - this is much louder and has way more bass. And you can hook it up to other Bluetooth speakers as well, pretty neat.In any case, if you are looking to buy you can pick these up on sale for relatively cheap. Great little thing to have and the sound quality of this small one is really good now.",0
5,"Much Improved
  
",13.Dec.18,Yes,"Very happy with the 3rd gen Dot.  I had previously gotten the 1st gen when it came out and did not like the sound from it at all.  Its improved a lot with the new version, no more 'tinny' sound.  I really like the new design as well, its not just a plastic disc.  The edges are rounded a bit and the side has a cloth like covering which makes it a lot more attractive and gives it a bit of 'grip'.  Got my echo in the kitchen so wanted this for the bedroom,  music is definitely better than previous versions and the microphones were very responsive  even with ambient noises playing.",0
1,"App is terrible
  
",13.Dec.18,Yes,"We cannot get our Echo to connect to the Internet so the device is useless.  When we were unable to get it to work, we had our son-in-law investigate the situation (he is EVER computer savvy and he said that the problem is with the APP - after one hours attempting to connect, no luck).  If Alexa doesn't connect soon, we will be returning her....she serves zero purpose in her present state.",1
5,"Alexa is My New Friend and Confidant
  
",13.Dec.18,Yes,"My insurance company Travelers decided it would be a good thing for their policy holders to have the device so they made a deal with Amazon to provide them. I live in a smart home and have been having more fun communicating with our friendly Echo Dot. Alexa is the call sign that begins a conversation with the high tech device. While I don't know many features at this point it is my understanding that there are over 50,000 commands. Thanks to Travelers for the introduction. Special note:  If you ask for something that might cost an additional fee Alexa asks if you want to learn more about the requested feature.",1
5,"This Item Is The Best
  
",13.Dec.18,Yes,"I love this device!!! We got this device not knowing all of the things it could do. At the time my husband and I just wanted it for the storytime, games, and music features. I love the sound that comes out of the speaker when we play music. I can set a reoccurring bedtime timer and my boys know when they here it that means it is bedtime. Our 3 year old son hates to get up in the morning. Now he can't wait because he knows he gets to ask the echo to play baby shark. This makes starting the day easier for us. We have found that we are laughing and spending more time as a family with this device. It is fun not listening to commercials. Now a days the commercials are so long on the radio that by the time they are done, so is my 3 year old. We are able to shuffle songs that my 3 year old, 10 year old, and we like to hear. Dancing in the house and doing chores with my boys, we can play games and get work done. It has helped my 10 year old with his spelling. We do not use this device all the time, but Alexa is great at activities that don't stop you from spending time with your family. We will be using the Santa tracking Skill this year and we are so excited to see how it will go over with our 3 year old. There is also a skill that you can call Santa and ""leave a message"" to add to your Christmas list. I don't think we are ready for that one this year, but maybe next year. We have only had the device out for about a week, but we are enjoying it so far.",0
2,"I want to love it but I_ just frustrated!!
  
",13.Dec.18,Yes,I_ becoming so frustrated with this thing!!!  I bought the Black Friday bundle with this and the new 4K fire stick.  It seems to be flipping impossible to connect the two together so I can control the fire stuck with voice commands through the echo dot- which is the main reason I purchased the dot along with the fire stuck.  I wanted to love the dot as much as I love the fire stick but I_e been tempted the chuck the thing out the window!!  Hopefully that won_ be necessary... but ii,1
5,"Much improved over previous versions
  
",13.Dec.18,Yes,"The overall sound and performance of the new generation echo dots appears to be better and excel over previous versions.  Sometimes it's just an image in your mind but in this case, the changes are apparent and real.  Are they vast and profound enough to warrant replacing all your previous generation echo dots with new ones?  NO!  But the changes are sufficient to warrant paying a little more for the newer generation if you have a choice when you make a purchase.",0
5,"fun to mess with
  
",13.Dec.18,Yes,couple hours in and we have it hooked up to our JBL flip 4 and just playing music.  It does a good job recognizing your voice over loud music.  I was impressed.  waiting on some smart plugs to be able to yell my lights off at night and on in the morning.  or set routines.  lots to learn.  asking for stories playing jeopardy just fun to mess with. especially for the price.  who cares if Bezos is listening in south park style?,0
4,"Sound quality is ok, but there are major improvements
  
",14.Dec.18,Yes,"Overall I am satisfied with my purchase of the echo dot generation 3. I have the second version of the echo dot and have posted a picture of the 3rd as well as second gens. The 3rd generation picks up your voice a lot better as well as has better sound quality. The sound quality while better is still lacking in bass and treble. It_ not terrible for the price but there are definitely better options if you don_ need Alexa. You can also use the auxiliary cord to plug into another speaker and make that speaker Alexa enabled. This is the major benefit of the dot for me. It makes my older, better sounding, and nicer speakers Alexa enabled! I hope this helped if it did please hit the thumbs up and if you have any questions feel free to ask and I will do my best to answer in a timely manner :).",1
4,"Alexa....
  
",14.Dec.18,Yes,"Ok, First off, I purchased three of these dot's, two for me, and one for my mom. The two dot's I purchased for me, I had to install manually, they wouldn't automatically connect to the wireless network for some reason, but were fine after I manually connected them. My mom's, well, her dot picked up the network but it took me a few times to connect it to the network. After they were connected, it took me a bit of searching to figure out how to connect the smart devices to the dots, but with a little research I was able to hook them up to Kasa with no problem and they work just great. I love Alexa, she is very helpful, I do wish however she was more.. well, like the AI in Eagle eye! Wouldn't that be cool?! But we work with the tools we were given. It would be awesome if you could change her name, and voice, and maybe make her start conversations or offer suggestions. I would recommend this device to anyone and everyone. The only problem I have is not knowing what Alexa sends to Amazon, that is the one thing that is constantly on my mind, and when you ask her, she says ""I don't know the answer to that"" So there is that one negative against the product. The data mining, and not knowing what data is being shared.",0
1,"Switching to google home mini
  
",14.Dec.18,Yes,"I got 2 dots for the kids rooms, and have Alexa built into my Bose soundbar. the intent was that we all would  be able to listen to different music at the same time if we wanted. Found out that we cannot do that unless we get the most expensive music unlimited package. So i would need to pay for prime and also pay 130ish per year for unlimited music. This product is not intended for families, if your single than your fine.very disappointed with the money making scheme amazon has deployed.",3
3,"Limited But Useful
  
",14.Dec.18,Yes,"I have had Alexa on my firestick and Kindle Fire, I decided to get the Echo Dot because it was on sale and I wanted something that would be interactive and useful without having to use the TV or Tablet all the time. Echo I noticed has limitations. Firstly, the smart speaker on the Echo Dot doesn't play music, you must buy speakers separately.  Secondly, the Echo Dot tends to want to use your phone rather than its own smart speaker for questions as it kept asking me if I wanted to use the device or app, I clicked on the device a few times in the app, then I decided to try the app, it never has asked me to choose since and I haven't been able to find a setting to switch it back. However, for routines, and books, the Echo Dot uses its own speaker unless you have other speakers connected to it or switch the setting to your phone which is easy to locate. I hope in the future that there is more stuff one could add to the routines, the radio selection is highly limited, newsflash is also highly limited, sports news is the same way. But even with such limitations, I find this product useful, and I can see expanding its capabilities in the future which makes the purchase worth it!",0
4,"Wasn't expecting it
  
",14.Dec.18,Yes,"I'm impressed.  Alexa recognizes multiple voices even with background noise.  If found this to be the perfect answer for turning devices on/off.  Way better then opening wink on my phone.  Its also faster.  The wink app can take noticeable time before turning a device on.  Alexa is almost instantaneous for the same device.4 stars because my special needs son can't say ""Alexa"" correctly enough.  I have no problem understanding that he's saying the word correctly.  There is no way to train for just that command word.  I also don't see a way to set schedules for devices through the Alexa android application.",0

I'm still new to the smart home thing but so far I've got some plugs for lamps and the christmas tree and this one smart bulb.

",14.Dec.18,Yes,I_ VERY disappointed. It doesn_ work. Constantly freezes  and makes a _kipping noise. Randomly stops playing music. It will randomly light up and do the processing light circle when no one has said anything. I have to unplug it to get it to recognize commands about once every hours. I will be returning it for a refund. Looking into the google one instead. I bought it for connectivity more then the speaker and it is awful. Don_ buy it.,2
4,"I wanted to order pizza.  Alexa read me the news instead.
  
",15.Dec.18,Yes,"1/9/2018  Edit:  This device is a solid 4 star device, maybe even 5-stars.  Amazon is vague with describing what the echo can do because it can do a bunch of stuff.  I wrote the harsh review below in anger when it couldn't do the one thing I wanted it to do properly, but then after complaining, Amazon reached out to me to offer help in properly setting up my Echo dot and issuing commands.  I still feel that the device is not *quite* as intuitive as they make it out to be.  You can also change the activation word from ""Alexa"" to ""Computer"", which makes me feel like I'm in Star Trek. In the end, it's a nice addition to a kitchen, as it can function as an extra cooking timer than can also perform any conversion (1/4 cup = 4 tablespoons), play your second-favorite song when your #1 favorite isn't included with your Amazon Music subscription (computer, play the theme song to 'Quantum Leap'), while also telling you what the wind speed is, and casually look up when Friedrich Nietzsche died for you (August 25, 1900) so you don't have to wonder about it while cooking biscuits.  I think the Echo dot can also give you recipe &amp; meal ideas to cook, but I already have a recipe for biscuits and for other meals I simply asked it to schedule a delivery of Soylent instead.Below is my original review for context.  As I have said, the Echo Dot is a 4/5 star device, would buy again, but it will still make you angry sometimes.I BOUGHT THIS SOLELY TO ORDER PIZZA AND IT DOESN_ WORK PROPERLY.1. Took 45 to set up.  That_ 40 minutes too long.2. Wanted to use Pizza Hut Skill.  When I asked Alexa to _rder a pizza from Pizza Hut.  She replied, _id you mean _mazon Restaurants? I said, _o!  Pizza Hut!!  Alexa: _rder from Domino_ Me: _izza Hut!  Alexa: _ see your current address is (address of family member who lives 2,000 miles away).  At no point did Alexa even mention that she was ordering from Pizza Hut or Domino_ or w/e.  Not to mention, this was another setback because I had to update my address properly, which you can only do from the stupid 2nd-rate Alexa app (3/5 rating for lackluster U/I input).  There were other complications along the way but I was so mad I forgot.3.  After properly setting up my address, the Pizza Hut skill, blah blah blah.  I instruct Alexa to _rder my favorite pizza.  Which is what they advertise you can do.  I went to the trouble of setting up the perfect order online on my Pizza Hut account to make this work.  I find out that you can_ use coupons with Alexa.  So finally, Alexa reads me my order summary - which is $7 more than it should be cause I can_ use a coupon -  Alexa says, _rror:  you will have to input your order online.  _HAT THE *fudge*?!? ARE YOU *fooling* SHIPPING ME?!?Alexa: _ would prefer not to answer that question.I added a star because you can ask Alexa to read you the headlines from The Economist.",1
3,"It_ a Little Better Than Ok.
  
",15.Dec.18,Yes,"My biggest issue with this device is privacy concerns. I guess I_ still skeptical. The other issue is the fact that it had to make an announcement in the middle of the night that it was updating. Seriously????!!  It wakes me up to announce an update!! I called Amazon regarding this and they said I would just have to turn the mic off.. how about just program it to not announce?  The directings seem conflicting. The instructions for different color lights are different depending on where you_e reading about it. For instance.. my messages came over a pulsing white light, not a yellow light.You cannot edit or delete info in the Alexa app.This device isn_ something I can_ live without but it has a couple benefits for me - the music and the free calling.",1
5,"Great device!
  
",15.Dec.18,Yes,"I love the speaker! I have both google and amazon. The differences I notice is that Alexa will ask more specific questions and when you ask or Moreno medical questions it provides very reliable information and sources. Google does not go into as much detail but does seem to be a bit more user friendly. For instance I_l tell Alexa/google to turn off the lights. Alexa will tell me there is more then one light and wants confirmation to which exact bulb I want to turn off. Google will just turn the lights off.  I figured out later that I need to name all my bulbs the same name if I want Alexa to turn them all off. There are other instances where google seems to understand more of what I want and in my opinion seems to be a bit more user friendly however Alexa does have strengths over google such as giving better and more detailed information. The speaker in the google mini seems to sound a bit better but not by too much. Alexa can send messages and can call people through my iPhone. I also like that I have a better selection of music through prime. It_ like a one stop shop. Overall each has its strengths and weaknesses. I have not messed around too much with each device side by side but once I do, I will add some more information. I am just glad that each gets updated and the more they are used the better technology will hopefully progress!",0

",15.Dec.18,Yes,"My Echo unit was purchased so that I could work in my garage and listen to talk radio. Echo can not find the stations that I want. I do get Holiday or specific music stations, but that is not what I need. There are really only two uses for my echo. First it is very good at telling me the outside temperature / weather and second it is very good at arguing with me. The only real advantage that I have is that working in the garage, if I get hurt I think Alexa can call 911. Yesterday Alexa decided that I would like to hear Rap. Never have I encouraged this. I stopped Alexa and attempted to correct it. The Echo responded with I'm sorry and went back to the Rap. There are times I feel like I am arguing with my children. Twice Echo has been grounded. I have also on occasion informed Alexa that she sucks. This has prompted the response please contact customer services. This relationship is quickly approaching another wife.",1
1,"Does not connect to Samsung galaxy 8plus or any Samsung device
  
",15.Dec.18,Yes,I dislike the fact that the dot does not connect  using a hotspot from Samsung Galaxy phones and Amazon knows this. I've been on the phone with them for 2 weeks trying to get this going. Still no results. Can't use echo dot with Samsung hotspot. No one at echo can understand why this is happening. Then there's instructions online telling you how to connect it but that's not true. Those instructions dont work. Why is Amazon selling this product knowing it doesn't connect to the Samsung hotspot nor does the regular echo.,2

These devices can all be controlled by the app(s) remotely or by voice when you're at home.

This time support said they had not knowledge of a system trouble and to send it back. We got the link for return postage but no reason why the first support woman lied. They said they were not allowed to do an exchange so we sent it back. We then realized to reorder would cost us about 6$ more than the Black Friday price. Chatted with support for about 20 minutes to get them to finally send one at the price we paid for the bad one. Over a week later and nothing in the mail and no link to use to complain since the return is complete.

",15.Dec.18,Yes,"Very frustrated with this new model. I say the same things I said with the 2nd gen but get no results. Plus I'm repeatedly told it ""doesn't do that"" but when I repeat the command phrase it does what it just told me it ""doesn't do that""I The speaker is much better but the voice recognition is much MUCH worse! I switched back to my 2nd gen unit and the response is much better. I'm also amazed that Amazon won't publish an honest review of their product simply because it's a bad review. This product has problems and the feedback is letting Amazon know. Is that not why they have reviews in the first place?",1
2,"Dot 3 does not work with a ring doorbell 2.
  
",15.Dec.18,Yes,I purchased the ring doorbell 2 and choose to receive a dot 3 with it. I assumed the dot would ring when the doorbell did but it does not. I'm not certain why but one would think it would. I ended up buying a ring chime which works but by the time it actually rings chances the person at the front door has already left. One would think that Alexa products work with each other. In addition if I would have bought the ring pro I read it works with the dot 3. There are too many issues to make this a good solution.,2
4,"Get the 2nd Gen!
  
",15.Dec.18,Yes,"Overall, I would say for the price/quality, the 2nd gen echo dot is better. To compare the two echos:Pros:-This one is loud. A lot louder. I turn it down about halfway.-Most music sounds way better. It's better than most generic Bluetooth speakers. It's also louder.- it just looks cooler.Cons:-The sound is muffled. Alexas voice is harder to understand.- It lost the super convenient USB power port.- I noticed that the mic doesn't sound as good. When I drop in or leave messages, it sounds a lot quieter than it does from my second generation.- the light bar is dimmer. This isn't awful, I just like the feedback without having to look directly at the dot. This is probably a pro to most.It really is a small difference and it's not that the 3rd Generation dot is bad, I just think the 2nd generation is better for the price. I use my 3rd gen for music in the bathroom and I use 2nd gen for pretty much everything else.",0
4,"Our third Echo
  
",15.Dec.18,Yes,"Since I purchased our first Echo (Dot 2nd Gen), we have addicted to Alexa for its instant responses like weather forecast and music playing.One thing I had hard times commonly with all Echoes is the registration process. My iPhone 7 never succeeds in registering Echoes over WiFi. So, each time, I had go to http://alexa.amazon.com on my laptop. Of course, if I didn't have a PC with WiFi, I would never be able to perform registration. This is why four stars. I wish Amazon to review this.",0
4,"Great speaker, Alexa has hard time hearing and answering some questions
  
",15.Dec.18,Yes,"Speaker on this dot is great. It's perfect for the apartment I live in, enoo to where I can hear it on the next room but not too loud to annoy neighbors. I was conflicted between choosing the dot or the echo because I am using this mostly for music, but it's working great.Alexa struggles to hear you if the music is too loud, so sometimes you have to raise your voice. The games you can play with Alexa are a lot of fun too. She just doesn't know a lot about how her app works, so sometimes you have to figure it out yourself.She tells me the weather each day and let's me know if there's a good chance of it snowing recently. She can tell me how long my commute to work will take. She plays music automatically from my Spotify once I connected it. She has helped me make grocery lists and logs it in the app so you never lose the list. I haven't discovered everything she does quite yet because I really just got it for music but some of the stuff she can do and knows has been awesome to have!",0
4,"Loud... sometimes too loud
  
",15.Dec.18,Yes,I had the second gen dot and added this one to my home as well this one is much louder and hears me much better however when music is playing she can_ hear me. I believe it is the positioning of the mic and speakers as even on moderate vol she can_ hear me over music when my face is two to 3 inches from the device and I yell. You have to manually toggle down the vol before telling her the new command which makes using her during cleaning or cooking quite challenging.,0
2,"Annoying popping sounds every half hour.
  
",15.Dec.18,Yes,I just received this in the mail. I immediately set it up as synced it with my other Alexa and smart devises. I woke up to it making a popping sound approx. every half hour. I did a little research and this seems to be a common problem. The research said the resolution was to unplug it and plug it back in to reset it... I did this and the popping sound continues. It's rather obnoxious. Not even my 1st generation does this.,0
5,"Fantastic product, I want more.
  
",16.Dec.18,Yes,"I wasn't sure exactly what to expect, this being my first smart home device. However, I have to say, I am pleasantly surprised.The setup was very simple. I downloaded &amp; opened the app, plugged in the Echo Dot, and followed the simple instructions on my phone. It connected to my Amazon account and told me about a few things that I could do with Alexa.I originally purchased this because I wanted a speaker that would connect to my music without using my phone as the intermediary. As advertised, it did this very well. However, it can do a lot more as well.I was getting tired of screaming ""Hey Siri!"" at the top of my lungs hoping that my phone would hear me. Now, I barely say ""Alexa"" in the room and she is ready for a command.When you have more than one in the house, they connect to each other and you can decide which one plays music, if not all.It looks great. The 2nd generation wasn't very inspiring to me in its design, but this one looks like a fancy speaker.The audio is fantastic. I want sure how it was going to sound since it's so small, but I never go above 5 out of 10 in volume because it gets so loud. The sound quality is also on par with some really good speakers that I've previously used.All in all, I highly recommend. If you are looking to buy a Bluetooth speaker, just buy this! It'll work better than other speakers at its price point.",0
5,"ALL OF US WERE DISAPPOINTED IN ALEXA'S NEW VOICE BUT AMAZON CAME THRU
  
",16.Dec.18,Yes,"After posting the ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW I actually received a call from Amazon support. That AMAZED me. They pointed out some settings I missed that had been added to the control app on my cell for the device. In particular, I could now adjust the treble &amp; bass. This essentially cured my issue.YAY AMAZON! RENEWED FAITH!=== ORIGINAL REVIEW ===We still have our Echo Dot 2nd Generation tucked in a draw &amp; it looks like she's going to be put back to work. We gave this 3rd generation a fair chance, almost 3 weeks, BUT WE ARE STILL HAVEING A DIFFICULT TIME ADJUSTING TO THE MORE MUFFLED SOUND OF ALEXA. _EVERYONE_ who hears ""her"" says the very same thing. I am so frustrated at this point I want to kick myself. I usually never buy a new version when released, and I know if it ain't broke, don't try to fix it, but I made an exception in this case because I trusted Amazon not to screw up something so basic as Alexa's voice. I was prepared to live with some initial bugs, BUT TO FIND THIS STRANGER IN THE HOUSE MASQUERADING AS ALEXA WAS SOMETHING I NEVER EXPECTED.Perhaps you will feel differently or your hearing is different. However, it was not just me that felt this way. Literally everyone is saying the say thing. WHY DID THEY DO THAT???",0
5,"Way better speaker that the original Dot!!
  
",16.Dec.18,Yes,"This is my 4th Echo product. I bought the original Echo when it first came out, a 1st Gen Dot,l shortly after that,  recieved a Show as a gift last Christmas, and now got this 3rd Gen Dot with a purchase of a Tile 4 pack. The new speaker sounds soooooo much better. Not quite as good as my Echo but log units better than the original Dot. I wish Amazon would have kept the knob on top to adjust volume but that_ just a small anoyance. I love Alexa and if I wasn_ worried about electronic waste (&amp; my wife leaving me for purchasing too much technology (jk I think she loves me enough to tolerate my technology addiction)) I would replace my current Dot with his new one and my original Echo with the newest and my Show with the newest. The speakers keep getting better and better. Still not HiFi but pretty good. If the Sonos speaker did everything that the Echo does, I would probably even get one of those. Alexa is part of my family now (jk again).",0
5,"Love Alexa Echo Dot 3rd Gen!
  
",16.Dec.18,Yes,"I am able to listen to Prime Music with an additional monthly charge.  I am a regular Prime member.  The speaker quality is very good and better than Home Mini, so I don't need to connect it to another speaker system.  I turned off all notifications because on the second day it pinged and then showed a green light.  Alexa said I did not have any notifications, but the light stayed green.  I tried to unplug it and re-plug it, but the light was still green. I felt someone was listening in on me even though Alexa said there were no drop-ins or phone calls.  The notification function will just have to stay off, which gives me peace of mind.",0

It frees me up a little, she has control of things, she uses echo to play audio books,news and weather, music,podcast ect.",0
5,"significant improvement over gen2, and a deal with recent pricing under $30
  
",16.Dec.18,Yes,"I've had a gen1 echo dot for about a year and a half now and it has always worked well, but it would also have difficulty understanding commands with background noise and the speaker worked well enough for voice, but was horrible for music.  The v3 echo dot sounds significantly better when playing music.  It still sounds thin and lacks bass response, but that is to be expected for a small speaker.  It seems to provide better microphones even though specs show fewer internal microphones. It also looks better.  In addition to the dots, I have a gen2 echo and fire tv cube with several smart home devices.",0
4,"Surprisingly intuitive
  
",16.Dec.18,Yes,"Sound quality is a little too much bass and muffled. Maybe there's a way to change it but I haven't looked.  I find this very useful just trying random things, like when in cooking saying ""Set a timer for 30 minutes"" and it just works. I'm having less success with custom commands. If you teach her ""Turn off the living room lights"" it's all well and good, but she won't have a clue what ""Turn the living room lights off"" means, so you better have a good memory of what you want her to know. As an aside, Alexa is smart enough to know to be quiet immediately when you swear at her ;)",0
4,"For the price - it_ a good deal and helpful
  
",16.Dec.18,Yes,The addition of Apple Music is awesome. The routines feature is a great way to for Alexa to perform multiple tasks in a row with one command. The start my day routine is great. Oddly these routines don_ work with the last list. Prioritizing tasks isn_ possible. Alexa doesn_ connect to Apple_ reminders. Skills - like accessing a news source or your bank account - are good but not great. There are many skills but overall the skills feel underwhelming and version 1.0. Voice response is fast and accurate when I used it. The speaker for music isn_ Dolby surround sound but it_ decent. You can_ beat the price which makes the echo a good deal.,0
5,"addicting and precise
  
",16.Dec.18,Yes,"i ended up buying the echo dot 3d gen out of impulse but oh my god this thing is fun to play with! i tell her to play anything and she will. also it has replaced my alarm since its louder and more soothing i love that it has an option to do daily briefing and you can add whatever you want to hear from it through your app on your phone. i also really love this feature that allows you to send a voice message to your echo through the app as well on your phone all you have to say is alexa announce "" "" and she will send your voice recording to the echo dot. i use it to freak out whoever is at home when im bored and im out and about lol. anyways this device is really helpful you can ask it almost anything and she will have a response for you and theyre frequently adding new commands on top of that. 10/10 would recommend",0
1,"Muffled
  
",16.Dec.18,Yes,Alexa_ voice is muffled which is super annoying. Sad that I would rather put my old one in my room than this one.  Just like your other upgrades to fire Tv.

",16.Dec.18,Yes,"I got this to turn my LG TV that has a Fire TV Stick 4K on/off, but it can't do that. It seems like Amazon wants to steer people towards the Fire TV Cube.I'm pretty sure they can just update the software so that it can be done, since Google Home Mini and Google Assistant easily turn on/off the same TV.The audio recognition I'm also not so sure about. I can ask my Home Mini to ""Play Twerk by City Girls"" and it understands. Alexa's history says ""Play Fart by City Groove"".",0
5,"Great speaker, few things could be added though
  
",16.Dec.18,Yes,"Very cute, practical and excellent response time. The information she gives when asked a question is short but good, it gets to the point of what you asked and cuts out all the extra stuff that isn_ of any importance to your question. Definitely better than Siri and most smart AI assistants, she can hear my voice over other sounds which makes talking to her in a crowded or loud house very useful and overall she meets all my expectations. The only thing I do wish is that you have more control of her over the app, for example instead of asking her to change the volume or going up to her why don_ we intergrate a control panel in the app that lets you adjust volumes to your liking, let_ you change the language she speaks or understands, changes the color of her circle light maybe from blue to pink or red or even cycle through a bunch of colors, have a mute botton on the app so that you don_ have to walk up to her and press the botton. There_ a lot of potential in the app that deserve to go with our smart buddy, it_ wonderful what we can do with our voices but if she had a control panel on the app it would make her better than any other smart speaker out there guaranteed.",0

Since you can now adjust the bass, mids and highs just wow. I ended up getting 3 more to basically setup an all home speaker system which sounds pretty darn good for the money. I have thee of them on outlet holders which makes rhe sound even better and keeps them off tables. Also the look is much better compared to the 2nd gens.",0
5,"It's Part Of The Family Now

Also did things like I didn't even know theres a Spongebob game u can ""activate"" in the skills section that tells u orders and then u gotta listen then pick one of 2 options to tell spongebob what to mak, etc and my 6 yr old loves it. Also got ambitent noise skills and such (birds, rain, fan, etc) which helps me goto sleep. Also bedtime stories to tell my kids at night which is cool cause I've read most of all the books I have already. It does much more to be sure but these are the main things I use em for, best $25 bucks I ever spent! (was on sale at the time). PS Alot of ppl said the dot doesnt have great sound but I say for the size it is, it has a decent speaker in it.

The Echo itself works fine but the skills catalog wont load completely so I can only enable skills that randomly pop up on the home page in the app.I have searched online for information and read reviews of the app in play store.. seems like there was an update last week that is causing issues for all users.Allrecipes skill isn't helpful at all. Despite finally figuring out how to enable the skill and installing the app, Alexa can't find any of my saved recipes in my favorites.Pandora works great, as do random questions. Over all, I'm pretty pleased but anxious for bugs in the app to be fixed.",0

",17.Dec.18,Yes,"I got this free with a re-up of my SiriusXM subscription. Unfortunately, you can only stream SXM through Alexa devices, and not Google due to an exclusive contract. So this dot sits on my coffee table and plays SiriusXM when I want to listen at home. I use my Google Home for EVERYTHING else. I tried Alexa, but she's not very smart or intuitive. She's great at finding deals on Amazon, or notifying you about Amazon shipments, or reminding you that you haven't bought anything on Amazon in a while, but beyond being a pestering advertisement for Amazon, it's a hunk of junk compared to Google Home. If it weren't free, and I didn't need it for SiriusXM, I'd be returning it for a refund.If you're considering setting up a smart home, go with Google. This is junk.",4
1,"Echo Dot is great ... just not this version, get the older one
  
",17.Dec.18,Yes,"Update 1/4/2019:After using the new Dot for several weeks, I have to lower the rating by yet another star. The sensitivity of the microphones is pathetic. You essentially have to stand right next to it an shout to have it act upon the voice command. It also takes significantly longer to respond, as if the processor that is being used in this V3 is less powerful than the one in V2. Stay away from the third-generation dot!Original Review:It pains me a bit to say this, but the new version (V3) of the Dot is a complete engineering failure. The three areas that have become significantly worse compared to V2 (which we have two of) are microphone sensitivity, sound quality, and power supply.- Microphone SensitivityFrom the very beginning, I had the feeling that voice recognition wasn't as good as with the V2. I had replaced our unit in the kitchen with the V3 thinking that it might eliminate the need to connect to an external speaker most of the time when casually listening to music. I noticed that I had to repeat myself more frequently when asking to add items to my shopping list, for example, or that the Dot misunderstood the items that I wanted to add.This morning, I ran a little test to confirm the problem. I placed the two Dots (V2 and V3) next to each other and asked for the time. The old (V2) Dot responded. I then moved the old Dot farther away in increments of 3 feet. In the end, the new Dot didn't start to respond before the old Dot was at 3x the distance between myself and the new Dot. I guess value engineering didn't work out here with the removal of 3 of the 7 microphones that were in the old Dot.- Sound QualityPeople speak about an improved sound quality. It certainly is louder, but extremely muffled even when adjusting the equalizer to reduce the bass to its minimum and cranking up treble and mids. It's fine for music, but voice responses sound like they come from under water. It's shocking how poor the speaker sounds. The V2 version was tinny, no doubt, and some of the firmware updates caused problems, but at least you could understand what Alexa was saying.- Power SourceThe V2 used a micro-USB plug. I bet you have a handful of those cables and 5V cellphone chargers sitting around in case the supplied cable or charger gives up the ghost. The new version switched to a proprietary barrel mount and hardwired charger. You'd have to get a replacement from Amazon and will always have to carry that particular charger if you take the unit with you on travels.- OverallGo with the V2 version of the Dot and save yourself the aggravation. If you've never had a Dot before, you may not realize how well this can work from a voice recognition and responsiveness point of view. The new Dot is junk.",2
5,"WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL MY LIFE ALEXA!?
  
",17.Dec.18,Yes,"I have been WAYYYY slow to the game when it comes to technology and Alexa. I know people have been using Alexa and other techno savvy things (like Siri- who never understands me). I just got a new apartment by myself and needed a speaker, so I saw the third generation Alexa and was surprised to see it so reasonably priced! Some speakers are WAY more than this! So I purchased Alexa.It has been WONDERFUL. Sometimes I feel a little mean, so I say please to her, but I am constantly bossing her around. Alexa play my Spotify music. Alexa call my mom. Alexa skip this song. etc. I easily switch her from room to room depending on what I am doing (cooking, showering, cleaning etc). She re-connects by herself within a minute after unplugging her. Every now and then I realize that she either stops working or doesn't understand me, but I finally figured out why- when something is on like my microwave, and she is near it (like when I was cooking), she momentarily stopped working. But as soon as the microwave stopped, she continued playing my music. I don't mind that, I get the electromagnetic waves and signals and whatnot. I like her, and she also keeps me company. I am excited to start using her to turn my lights on and off without getting out of bed at night (who else fears the little toe trolls on the floor running from your light switch back to your bed!?) Anyways, would absolutely recommend!BTW: ALSO got one for my grandpa. I think she is GREAT for elderly people, because she can remind him of appointments and dinner dates, and even tell him when something is ready to be taken out of the oven. Especially since his memory is beginning to go just a little, I think this is absolutely great!",1
4,"This 3rd gen Echo Dot is better for music
  
",17.Dec.18,Yes,"Compared to the 2rd gen Echo Dot, playback on this 3rd gen Echo Dot has a fuller sound with more bass.  But voice intelligibility isn't as good as the 2nd gen, IMO.  3rd gen seems optimized for music playback, 2nd gen better for common Alexa voice interaction.  2nd gen uses USB (5V) for power, 3rd gen uses AC power adapter (12V).  The stereo pair configuration is a useful new Alexa option which can work on both 2nd and 3rd gen Echo Dot for music playback.  I had trouble at first configuring them for stereo pair or multiroom sound.  Even though the two 3rd gen Echo Dots were both on the same network, I kept getting Network Connectivity error.  I could check one, but immediately the other would show an exclamation mark on Alexa's app.  The problem was a setting on my Wireless router.  I had ""Set AP Enabled"" to Off, but I had to change it to On.  On allows client devices on my Wireless network to communicate with each other.  I was then able to create a stereo pair.",1
5,"Wonderful entry into home automation!
  
",17.Dec.18,Yes,"I bought these while they were on sale for $30 and I can tell you that just asking for the weather every day while getting dressed was worth that much. I added a 6-plug smart power-strip, and with that, I have bedtime routines that include turning off lights and turning on the fan.Something awesome and unexpected is how easy it is to listen to Audible. No, it does not yet do Audible on all devices, so doing this multi-room does not work without setting up Bluetooth speakers, BUT, listening to Audible USED to be... Grab phone, turn on BT, find speaker, turn on speaker, pair with BT speaker, open app, find book, play book. NOW it's: ""Alexa, open audible."" THAT'S IT. She opens it and resumes the last book played. SO MUCH BETTER, especially for sneaking in just a few minutes of play time while doing dishes.Between this and the ECHO, the main difference is how it sounds, and how far away it can hear you.If you are just trying home automation for the first time and don't have much money, it's worth grabbing the Echo Dot on sale if you aren't sure you will like it, BUT, the Echo gets about two volume levels higher than the Echo Dot, has a more resounding sound, and it can hear you from farther away.I suggest that if you think you will like it and you are going to get just ONE device, get the Echo. If you think you will want to cover two different rooms, get at least one Echo and one Echo Dot.You COULD feasibly do all Echo Dots. But, I am really glad that my main device is the Echo.AND - don't forget, you can always try both and return one! Especially if there is a brick-and-mortar store near you (I had no idea there was until I shopped for this, and then I was in there like four times!).",0
5,"Awesome Sound, Alexa Responsiveness - Not So Much
  
",17.Dec.18,Yes,"I had the earlier generation echo dot, and traded it in for the new generation echo dot - its a completely different experience. So here are some of the pros and cons I noticed as compared to previous generation echo dot:Pros:1.Sound quality (alexa sound or music or news) is much, much better and deeper, richer in the new echo dot. The bass is is definitely an upgrade - plus with the larger body, I think it has bigger speakers - so the sound produced is much nicer.2. Form Factor: The fabric exterior casing is definitely a huge plus, as it is more soothing to the eye than the plastic casing for the previous gen echo dot.Cons1. Alexa responsiveness: The new echo dot has 4 ( I think) microphones, as compared to 8 on the previous generation echo dot. I have noticed that Alexa is not as responsive and takes more time to pick up voice commands.2. The blue ring on the top much more jittery when you say alexa (it moves in an awkward manner when you call alexa and the light blue portion of the blue rings adjusts to where you are speaking from). Definitely a more awkward, less responsive Alexa.3. Size: Its way bigger than the previous echo dot, while the fabric casing is a plus, the size, in my opinion, the previous gen echo dot was betterOverall: This echo dot is great - the only thing that is lacking is sufficient microphones so that Alexa responsiveness is as good as the previous gen echo dot",0
5,"Great gift! A great comfort! Easy 2 set up
  
",17.Dec.18,Yes,"Works great! Just a wonderful technological advancement!! So nice to give as a gift to elderly parents as well. If they fall or something happens....Alexa call 'name of son or daughter' and you can get help to them right away. It's fantastic that Alexa is always listening for her name! It cracks me up the people who give it bad reviews because she listens. Lol. That is the whole point of having a talking interactive digital personal assistant...to be there 24/7, to respond to her name, when you need her. But personally, I am very very glad that something is there to help my parents when I can't be. The reminders are also nice for the elderly. Medication reminders or just reminders in general. And for me, I travel a lot and LOVE that I can turn my lights on and off.....from 1,000 miles away....to make it look like I am home. And when I am home....no searching on you tube for songs....Alexa play this 'such and such song' and she plays it!!!!!! And I can even lock my doors and arm my digital Life security system! Adding that skill was incredibly easy and everything was a whole lot easier than I thought it would be to set up!!",0
4,"Apple Music is BUGGY! Two Versions of Hardware?
  
",17.Dec.18,Yes,"Ordered two at the same time to save some money. Both devices arrived and I set the first one up with Apple Music no problem. The second one however will NOT PLAY APPLE MUSIC. Period. ""I'm sorry, I'm having trouble playing this"". I've tried everything. Hard reset, unlink, re-link, unregister, re-register, no dice. Everything else seems to work OK.My old Gen2 Dot also now plays Apple Music seamlessly.Upon further inspection, it appears that Amazon may be second-sourcing some of these. I noted that the SW version on each speaker is completely different (as in not even in the same number of digits), even after updating both to current version. I'm guessing that the hardware inside these is different too, one can't work with the Apple Music skill, and that it's a luck of the draw which you will get when you order it.I have two more on the way, will be interesting to see if both of them will work with Apple or not.  I'll update this review with my results.**Update #1**I did get Apple Music working on this unit. Looks like Apple Music will not work if your Dots are spread across more than one WiFi network. For example, my home has two WiFi routers, one upstairs and one downstairs. If you want to stream Apple Music to all units, they all must be associated with the same router. This may be an Apple restriction to prevent the sharing of Apple Music with other people. Updated to 4 stars.",0
2,"Very unsatisfactory
  
",17.Dec.18,Yes,The only thing about these that I can say is acceptable is the voice activation.  The quality of sound is abysmal.  I bought two of them and they both sound horrible.  Very mushy.  Especially the spoken word.  The setup for these is even worse.  The only directions are to plug it in and follow the directions on the Alexa app.  Tried that.  The Alexa app told me absolutely nothing.  Ye *will* wind up needing to call Amazon customer service.  They were very patient with me and stayed on the line till both were set up.  Even then it took a while.There was absolutely nothing intuitive about setting these up.  Without help I would not have been able to get it done.Just based on the difficulties I had with setup and the horrible quality of sound I'm very reluctant to even try the more expensive Dot devices.,0

The sound quality on this small dot is great and the smart home features are excellent!One small thing that was disappointing is that the microphones don_ seem to work as well as the standard echo. Maybe it_ my imagination or the location, but we regularly have to repeat ourselves, especially when the TV is on.Also needs updating is the Apple Music integration. Needs to be able to play smart playlists on Apple Music, and to be able to add shuffle to the commands (such as play XYZ playlist, shuffled). Right now you have to ask it to play a playlist, then ask it to shuffle.I would also like to see the light ring at the top be used as a visual way to count down a timer!Fix that and the product would be excellent!",0
5,"Couldn't love this more!
  
",17.Dec.18,Yes,"We received a 2nd gen echo dot from our internet provider for free, so it was a perfect chance to give Alexa a shot. We loved the features on it so much, we ordered a 3rd gen to use in the front of the house. The 3rd gen speakers are so much better than the 2nd get (not anything like a sound system but perfectly adequate for christmas music!) that we ordered another 3rd gen to replace our 2nd gen. This version is also more aesthetically pleasing, as it comes in a softer look and softer colors than the stark black or white of gen 2. It's not a giant brick on your countertop.Not only is it super easy to set up, but it actually understands what you're saying. We're an apple household but Siri just sucks when you're trying to get it to understand you. Alexa never gets it wrong; she even understands my 6 and 4 year old who constantly want to play memory games with it. We couldn't be happier with our purchases and plan on giving these for Christmas as well!",0
5,"Good music quality compared to echo dot 2
  
",17.Dec.18,Yes,Own 1 echo and 2 echo dots 2nd gen purchase one new one to replace my bedroom one so the other in my garage. I read about one of the differences between echo 2 and 3 was the speaker so had to get it when it is on sale this December with the tplink smart wifi plug. Just rcvd it and installed it today so easy to setup and theMusic speakers is really much better not bose quality but much better than 2. Wouldn_ mind upgrading all my echo dots to 3 but it would be a waste of money. May wait for 4 to upgrade the rest. Overall great buy for $29.99 and super easy to setup with Alexa. Thanks Amazon you have another hit.,0
5,"Major sound improvement
  
",17.Dec.18,Yes,"Bought this to replace my previous Dot I_ had in my bedroom after buying a new 3rd gen one for my kitchen. Playing them together at the same time walking back &amp; forth to each room the sound quality is very noticeably different. The new 3rd gen has a much richer deeper sound to it &amp; the sound is consistent at higher volumes. After hearing the new one, my old one sounded like a toy. Plan to retire it to the garage for music &amp; info on those rare occasions I_ out there working. If you have an old one, take advantage of the sale &amp; upgrade. You won_ regret it. And btw ridiculously easy to set up.",0
3,"Not too easy to set up
  
",17.Dec.18,Yes,"Once I got it set up using my laptop computer, I was quite well pleased.But it seems to be an afterthought and the Mobile App is the best way to set it up.Eventually I cleared enough memory in my phone to download the mobile app, but then the controls disappeared from the laptop and the green light was flashing on the Echo Dot (3rd gen). Tried getting support from the 24 hour support site, but it was never available, which was quite concerning. Tried asking Aleksa why the green light was flashing and there was no specific answer... only several suggestions what it might be, but no instructions how to fix them.Eventually managed to disable 'drop in' using the mobile app and now it's working fine.I am not optimistic about adding more devices, but I will try. I would have given this 5 stars if reasonable instructions were included..",0
3,"Speaker Problems and Non-Responsive - Gen 3
  
",18.Dec.18,Yes,"Gen 3 has problems. I had received a Gen 2 from a neighbor as a birthday gift. Something I didn't know I needed and I love having Alexa answer questions, give me the news, play music, etc. Now, Gen 2 came with problems since it was a gift. Somehow it stopped working because amazon thought it was stolen (although they never came out and told me that) and it took the neighbor to straighten it out. As a long-time customer of amazon, it was the first time I've ever had problems with amazon.Anyway, we enjoyed having the dot that I kept in my bedroom since that's where my home office is located. When I saw the Gen 3 on sale, I decided to purchase one. I moved the Gen 2 to the front room where my husband could enjoy music, ask questions, etc.At first, the Gen 3 was great. Loved everything about it and it worked fine. Then the speaker started to sound muffled. Alexa sounded like she had a lisp (sorry for those reading this who have lisps). Then the news briefing would give the weather, announce the next story and stop. After talking with support, I sent it back and ordered a replacement, which I was assured would not have the speaker problems or lapse in stopping during news briefings. I received the replacement, set it up, and guess what! Although the speaker seemed ok, the news briefings stopped working. Contacted support and was told it needed an update that would take 3-5 hours! OK. Update took place (in the background so I didn't have to do anything). It started working and all was good with the world (well actually we know not all is good with the world, but all was good with the world of Alexa in our bedroom.Guess what started happening again? Yep, Alexa will tell the weather then will stop. I go into the other room to hear my news briefing. This morning it didn't work, I tried again just now and it gave me one story after the news (an update). It's just not right and I would not recommend purchasing Gen 3 until amazon gets these bugs straightened out. Gen 2 never had these problems. I guess an updated product is not necessarily a better product.I said I was not going to call support again, but why should I pay for something that does not work as it should?",5
3,"Echo...turn on the review of 3rd generation dot
  
",18.Dec.18,Yes,"Well i wanted to like it because i figured the new 3rd generation would be better than the previous 2nd generation as far as features and appearance...  I basically hide mine and and ask it stupid questions about weather ,the time, whats 5 x5 when paying bills online or play some music . i will get to that ! ........the real reason i purchased this was to control smart plugs around the house..i think it the best thing since sliced bread... turn on the Christmas tree ...done  its good to wake up smelling hot coffee ..you get it... anyway thats that ..now the musical part of this review is after playing music since i owned this 3rd gen i noticed that the speaker has started getting crackly and the bass has made the device sound like a really loud stereo in a honda civic thats rattling from all the bass shaking it apart..anyway on the alexa app you do have many features to control everything from light to sounds and no matter how i change the bass , treble,or midrange it has started sounding like the civic...im debating weather tk send it back and keep the 2nd generation insted of this one . The dot to me dosent have to have all this upgrading and appearance enhanced look for what its capable of based on the size and it functionality  if you demand higher audio quality and want to keep it on the coffee table like a vase of flowers  than go with the larger models amazon offers. But for the basics of its intent the 2nd generation is fine",1
1,"Verification Failure!
  
",18.Dec.18,Yes,"After Amazon deleted my original post for supposedly cursing- I've cleaned it up a bit- no bad words in the original just didn't like what I said!On Dec. 6 2018 right after opening and trying to set it up-Just received today and out the box. I downloaded the Alexa app, connected Alexa to the power and now I have been waiting for an hour and half for the verification code.... I restarted my phone and have requested the code to be sent 5 different times and I have not received a single one... Its annoying! I figure it would take the most 15 mins to set up but this waiting is ridiculous! One of the most advance company in the world cannot send me an instant code to set up one of their most used devices! Come on Amazon get it together... I'm about to return this if I don't the code in the next 15 mins and that's being generous with the time!Dec. 18. 2018 - though I have a working device the phone verification has no purpose- unless it is so I can call and text people on my phone- if this is the case- It has been 12 days and I have yet to receive a verification code on my phone so I can set this feature.  NO CODE at all after 12 days and I have tried it numerous times- what is the purpose of the phone verification? it does not work for me!I'm giving it 1 star because it has wasted a lot of my time and it has been annoying.  I'm not sure if I have a defective device.  I'm not sure.  I'll be more than happy to return if they pay for the return and get me a new one.  I'm just annoyed that no idea why there's a phone number verification if it has no purpose.",1
5,"Yes, yes, yes!
  
",18.Dec.18,Yes,"AMAZON. I was mad at you for a while because you rejected a nice review of a company who sold me a great product so I vowed never to write another glowing review but I am SO happy at my purchase that I just had to share.I have to admit that I am the kind of person who is overly suspicious of ""big brother"" listening in but I took a chance while the dots are on sale and boy am I so glad I did. This dot is the best! I now have several scattered throughout my house, and love all the features it has to offer:The first thing I did after installing was ask Aleksa to play some holiday music. BOOM. There it was. In really great quality considering the size of the speakers. Wow. Then I started exploring, finding out all that Alexa has to offer. I asked for the weather, the meaning of life, and whether my husband is still cheating on me (Alexa said ""Hmmm, I don't know) so the jury's still out. Next I discovered Alexa's skills. The kids can now ask where Santa is and get a very personalized answer. They love asking Alexa questions, and my daughter even said Alexa you are beautiful to which she responded ""and so are you, you are so beautiful"" so she is winning over our hearts. With the new ""announcement"" feature that targets specific devices I told me husband my new favorite hobby is scaring the kids when they think I don't know they're really up playing games when they're supposed to be in bed. And finally, I drift off to sleep using this guided meditation skill I enabled. I have not slept so good in many years. Thank you.There are a few drawbacks- my youngest son is named ""Aleksa"" which is pronounced slightly differently but still is enough to trigger the echo. But we will be changing the wake-up word via the app which is super helpful. I also notice that with our shoddy internet that of more than 1 person is using Wifi than the speaker cuts off but that is not Alexa's fault. Also, it is a bit creepy what this speaker is ""hearing"" in our household but to be honest I don't really think anyone would care about our personal life as we are as boring as all get out.Overall, despite my initial qualms this speaker is everything to me, and I can't wait to purchase more. I'm not paid by amazon, nor do I have any financial reasons whatsoever to write such a glowing review but THANK YOU for this great device. You rock Amazon!",0
4,"Better Speaker, Worse Microphone Than 2nd Gen.
  
",18.Dec.18,Yes,"The design as far as aesthetics is concerned is an upgrade from the 2nd gen version we have. However the ability to hear commands seems to be a bit of a downgrade. There is now an equalizer, so the sound can be adjusted to your liking.Alexa's voice now has much more bass. The added bass does enhance music played through the 3rd gen dot. The equalizer option in the app has given me the ability to lower the bass and increase the treble for a clearer voice.What is becoming more evident is that this 3rd gen does not hear us as well as the 2nd gen version - especially when it is playing music or there is some background noise. This newer version is in the same location as the previous 2nd gen dot, however we have found that we have to be just a little louder when giving commands. This is likely due to the newer version only having 4 microphones as opposed to the 7 on the 2nd gen.If the 3rd gen had the same ability to hear as the 2nd gen, then it would be the clear winner. Simply put, the new version has a better speaker, but worse microphone setup.",0
5,"Much better than generation 2.
  
",18.Dec.18,Yes,It sounds much better than second generation echo dot. Since I don't own any bigger echo device I cannot compare.I have noticed some delay between Alexa word and the LEDs turning on to recognize the commands. The LEDs also turn off for a moment and then on again to tell the response to the command. Something annoying if you are used to previous version where the LEDs keep on all the time until the command is completed and the response received.I tested placing my echo dot 3rd generation into a medium size metallic bowl and got a much better sound. Something like an acoustic box. I recommend testing it.,1
5,"Nice improvement
  
",18.Dec.18,Yes,"I have a few Alexas. This one I use in the living room. It's a big improvement over the previous Dots. The look is much improved in a living room setting. The sound is much better though a bit limited in high range. I don't listen to music on this, I have the bigger ones in different rooms for that. But I suppose you could listen to music in a pinch. A child would be happy with it for music, an adult probably won't. At first I thought the mics were weaker than the second generation. But it has seemed to improve. Not sure if it was an update or what. The size is a bit larger but still leaves plenty of room where it's placed.",0
5,"This 3rd Gen Dot is awesome!
  
",18.Dec.18,Yes,"I have an Echo, Tap, a Dot Gen2 and two Dots Gen3.  The sound on the Gen3 is far superior yo the Gen2; it's louder, deeper and solid for a device the size of a hockey puck.  Sound is more than adequate for bedside.  I purchased the Gen3 on Black Friday with a smart switch  because of the price.  I liked it so much that I bought a second one.  I am now starting to take advantage of using Alexa to control lights and other devices.  The Alexa app keeps getting better.  If you haven't gotten an Alexa device, this would be a great place to start.  You won't be sorry.",0
4,"Small echo big sound
  
",18.Dec.18,Yes,"I have the echo and I travel with it, and use it on a daily despite its large size. Well when I saw this echo dot on sale, I grabbed it. And although it_ just a smaller version of the echo. I like the design. But I did have a issue with some type of static going on, and it wasn_ even loud. I unplugged it and plugged it back up, and that seemed to fix the problem. Overall it_ a cute little speaker for traveling or if you_e like me, listening to music while showering. The sound is decent, bass could be a little more, but it can get pretty loud for its size.",0
2,"Everyone says she_ cool but not really impressive
  
",18.Dec.18,Yes,"She_ cool. She tells me the weather. But my brand new Vizio Smart TV? Nah...skill is enabled but she _an not connect bc the skill isn_ enabled. Same applies for about 3 other devices that say they are enabled under my app, but she has no enabled skill when I ask her to do certain things. For being so _mart, she_ pretty much just Siri.  Nothing special. What_ the point of having so many _kills if they don_ work properly? With everyone telling me how awesome she was and how little is needed to be done to set her up, she_ a great big disappointment.",0

",18.Dec.18,Yes,"though i dont have any smart devices yet, other than my fire stick which i havent tried yet, i do plan on getting some plugs to try out. so far she's (alexa on the echo dot) has been helpful with reminders, calender events, the weather and answering random questions. the sound qality is pretty good for such a tiny unit. i still have a lot to learn since i've only just got them. i do love adding things to my shopping list through her instead of waiting to write it down and then forgetting what i needed. boom its right there on my phone. i'm already planning on getting and echo show for the kitchen so i can see recipes and such. i would recommend this device and plan on getting one for my kids in the future to make it even easier to keep in touch.",0
2,"Alexa sounds like Southpark's Kenny
  
",18.Dec.18,Yes,"The Gen 3 is pretty with its fabric cover and softer shape, and its mic array is noticeably better at recognizing commands from a distance, however Alexa's voice is far LESS INTELIGIBLE. Far from the bright, crisp tone of Gen-1 (we have two), Gen-3 Alexa sounds like she's talking through a pillow. If I hadn't thrown away the box I would take it back to the Amazon kiosk at the mall and exchange it for a Gen-2. Now I understand why their Gen-3 display model ""wasn't working.""",0
1,"Useless and NOT Smart
  
",19.Dec.18,Yes,"I received 2 of these free with my recent purchases of Amazon Blink cameras.  The blink cameras were actually easier to set up than the echo dot. After spending 2 hours trying to set it up and figure it out, I finally gave up. Both are now sitting in boxes. It's totally useless in my opinion.  It basically is just a voice command station which my phone already does. Everyone talks of what a wonderful speaker it has but I never got it to work with music. Thats the most disappointing part of all. All I heard was ""I'm sorry. I dont understand that command."" Smart??? My dog is smarter! I wish I could return them and get money back for them but they were free.  Glad I didn't have to pay for them.",2
5,"Great Functionality and Sound
  
",19.Dec.18,Yes,"We loved our first two Dots so much, we ordered two more.  We now have the Echo (2nd gen) plus four Gen 3 Dots.  This gives us an Alexa connection in all the most used areas of the house.  The Dots have very good sound considering their size.  The intercom feature is nice, and the grouping feature works great.  It's nice to walk from room to room and hear the same music in perfect synch in each room.  I will look into hooking up to our Bose radios in the future to get even better sound.  The only problem with that is that doing so will disable the internal speaker, so I will either have to disconnect the Bose, or leave it on ($$ + energy).  Since I ordered 2 Dots at a time, I had one setup problem.  As I went through the setup, it did not complete, and when restarted thought I was doing the second Dot, not the one I was working on.  It may be because I tried to rename it during the setup process. The problem was easily diagnosed when I said ""Alexa, say device name"" and the response was not the correct name. A little editing, and all was fine.",0
5,"Wayyyyyyyyyyy better than Google home mini
  
",19.Dec.18,Yes,"I initially thought whatever the tech giant Google launches will be super cool and top notch in quality and performance and I bought two Google home mini, then the shocker, its sooo pathetic in quality that i had to return both of them, then thought of giving Echo dot 3 a try, i would handsdown say Echo Dot 3 is atleast 10 times better than Google home mini.Pros of Echo Dot 3 over Google home mini-  4 mics vs 2mics - from one room i was able to give a command to the alexa which is sitting in another room(distance between rooms is 35feet). and google home was so pathetic i have to maintain a distance of atleast 15feet.- response when playing songs (however loud the songs might be playing, alexa responds brilliantly, Google sucks, it just doesnt listen even when i go and shout at its face with just 1 feet distance also)-  superb build quality vs mediocre quality (do not fall for the looks of google home mini)- Excellent audio quality vs normal audio quality (for the speakers of this size , echo dot 3 is excellent)- ""alexa"" vs ""ok google"" - totally annoying to call it ""ok google"" every time -worst ever implementation by Google- response time - ""alexa, turn on the lights"", but google home ""ok google"" wait till it responds then say ""turn on the lights""- More tactile nice Buttons vs no buttons at all - i had google home for 2 months, not even once i was able to increase or decrease the volume with ease, shame on you google.- easily mute by press vs take the google home mini in your hands and then turn it upside down and then slide the mute mutton - wow how can google implement it so stupidly?Pros of Google home mini over Echo Dot 3- Google home mini looks cute and doesnt look like a speaker at all.The only Advantage of mini over dot 3 is looks and nothing else NEVER BUY GOOGLE HOME MINI (its one beautiful crap),Now I am going to order two more echo (a bigger one and dot)",0
4,"Definitely better sound quality
  
",19.Dec.18,Yes,"I already own the 2nd Gen. Dot. This was on sale so I moved my kitchen Dot to another room and replaced it with this 3rd Gen. Dot. Of course immediately you notice the powerful sound quality. Everything is just as good as the previous version. I was actually hoping for other noticeable improvements. I was hoping for a faster response. It responds just as fast as my original Dot. I don't like the pause you have to make after saying Alexa and then you can ask your question. I am sure they will fix this small irritation, I just hope you do not have to buy a new Dot to be able to have the capability to say Alexa and immediately state your command.",0
1,"FRUSTRATING
  
",19.Dec.18,Yes,"I ordered this because I thought it would be similar to google. It does not stay hooked up to the WIFI and I have to keep reinstalling. It works for a while then it does not. I have to go to my fire tablet to get it to do anything. I am thinking about returning it unless I can find an easy fix. I love my 10"" fire tablet, but not my Echo.I wonder if anyone else has had this issue and found a solution. Would be interested in hearing if you have.",1
5,"Best echo dot yet!
  
",19.Dec.18,Yes,"I already own multiple echo's in my house, but wanted to try the newer gen 3 version. I absolutely love it. The sound is so much better and it looks even better than before. It is good enough and loud enough that I can listen to most music without connecting to an external speaker. Relatively deep bass and not overly punchy but present miss and highs. The volume also loud enough to fill a small room all while being able to hear your commands from accords the room.The connection seems to be just as good as the gen 2 so no difference there. All in all I love it. I will be ordering more to replace some of my older ones.",0
5,"Has better speaker than the earlier gen 2
  
",19.Dec.18,Yes,"Love the Echo Dot.  Reminds me of appointments I have scheduled, and converts my verbal grocery list into an email that I can read while I'm shopping.  Haven't had it long enough yo know everything it does, but it knows my name and it doesn't answer when the dog barks.  It can time dishes that I'm cooking, and remind me to check status; doesn't mix up multiple reminders.  Yes, I do feel it is spying on me, so I talk say much of anything personal, and cut it off when I've got company.  It freaks some people out; but they do like the music feature and so do I.  Ask it to find almost anything from Bach to ....., and Alexa finds it!",0
4,"Worth it
  
",19.Dec.18,Yes,"Honestly I never thought I_ own one of these things but there was a deal for cyber Monday we couldn_ pass up, so we got one! We have it in our living room, and hooked up 2 smart bulbs to 2 main lamps we use. I will say it was VERY difficult to get the WiFi connection set up so that the bulbs and the Echo could connect and the Echo to turn them on. Not sure what happened but overnight the connection wasn_ successful. The set up process through the Echo so that the smart bulbs will turn on/off/dim is also very tedious, but it_ worth it. It takes some getting used to it comes in handy.",0
2,"It's aight
  
",19.Dec.18,Yes,"Great sound for such a small speaker, I received mine as a gift. Alexa works well, I wish there was an easier way to learn how to use this device other than emails. I enjoy using it as a wireless speaker at home, it works especially well as a sound machine, I keep mine by my bed and use it to help sleep. The reason I give two stars and not five is because there's no battery, and this device MUST be plugged in in order to operate, the included cable is incredibly short, and I haven't figured out if there's a voice command to tell Alexa not to listen to you (as if you were to press the mute button and the red ring appears). Also, a side note, wouldn't it be cool if this device doubled as a wireless charger? This in my opinion would have offset the fact that it does not have a battery. Or at least a couple USB type A power out ports. Some sort of charging capabilities would be very nice, considering you cant take this device anywhere outside the home. It would also be great if there was a button command you could press on the speaker to enter Bluetooth pairing mode, instead you have to use the app/website which in my opinion is cumbersome. Overall this is a ""good"" product, I'm glad I received it as a gift because however ""good"" it is, I would not spend my own money on it.",0
2,"Not always there to assist but confuse
  
",19.Dec.18,Yes,The device itself is well-made sounds great and looks good but the functionality is not there after setting it up it turns off the wrong lights tells me some lights don_ exist then tells me that there are multiple lights with the same name none of these things are true so therefore as good as the device is I couldn_ recommend it for anything beyond asking a basic questions or to play music or tell the weather.  We own the second generation bought the third gen on another account set them both up I wish I would_e just bought an apple home pod.,0
5,"Echo Dot is a Great foundation to a smart home...
  
",19.Dec.18,Yes,I am very pleased with the Echo Dot third generation that I purchased. It_ a lot of fun and it is extremely easy to connect with other Echo Dots.  I love the feature that allows one to connect two plugs or lights which is very convenient and controlling the lighting in your entire home. I can_ imagine the possibilities of providing or creating a smart home using the Echo Dot as your foundation .  I love to ask questions of an Alexa only to find it providing with most of the answers. As time goes by I continue to find features that make life easier.,0
5,"Totally worth it
  
",19.Dec.18,Yes,"Have wanted an Echo for awhile; when I saw that price, I had to get it. Alexa tells me the weather, the correct time, tells me jokes, plays my favorite music, plays Jeopardy with me, even reminds me to do things! She's even polite. If I invest in some extras, I'll even have her turning on my lights. My future self may need something that's voice-activated (I'm 61); hoping it will help with my Fire TV. But it's not only useful - it's fun! Haven't had any problems, except remembering all of Alexa's skills. So cool.",0
3,"Not as good as my 2nd gen
  
",19.Dec.18,Yes,"This one does not pick up my voice as well as my second generation echo. Sometimes I have to use the _ake word like three times until she finally awakes. With my old echo it was much more responsive. However this new 3rd gen is a lot louder, like twice as loud I would say!Update: Amazon reached out to me about the issue and sent me a new dot. This newer one is more responsive than the first one I received but it_ still not as responsive as my second generation dot, I_ still doing tests and comparing both of them.",0
5,"Much Improved Sound
  
",19.Dec.18,Yes,"Prior to ordering this, I had 3 Gen 2 Echo Dots, 1 Gen 1 Echo, and 1 Gen. 2 Echo, so I am quite familiar with the Echo product and Alexa integration.  The new 3rd Generation Echo Dot functions much the same as the others, but the sound quality is much improved over the Gen. 2 Echo Dot.  It is obviously not on the level of a full sized Echo when it comes to music, but I would argue that Alexa voice responses sound every bit as full, where on previous Echo Dots, her responses sounded quite tinny.  The improved sound also helps it function as a much better sound machine and alarm clock for bedroom use.",0
1,"Waste of time.
  
",19.Dec.18,Yes,"I finally decided to get this device a try . I recieved the Echo dot in the mail and after 3 hours of attempting to set this thing up, emailing and speaking to customer service on the phone and trying every suggestion they had to offer, I have come to the conclusion that this product is not worth the time or effort. Customer service suggested that it may be my Internet connection. But since every device in my home connects it is not my Internet connection. It is the Echo dot. I am sending this back. Thanks for nothing Amazon.",1
5,"Great for quick inquires; the dog thinks her name is ""Alexa"" now
  
",19.Dec.18,Yes,"I bought this during cyber week in a package deal with smart bulbs. While I haven't tried out the smart bulbs, I've asked Alexa a variety of questions about weather, current events, movies, astrophysics and theory. I can tell she pulls most of her information from either Google or Wikipedia. While on Christmas vacation, I'm trying to stay away from sitting at a desk so she's great for quick inquiries. The other day I heard my boyfriend answering political questions that Alexa was asking HIM in the form of some quiz with multiple rounds. I believe the dog thinks we're changing her name to ""Alexa"" as she trots over when we call for the Echo across the room. It has a great range as I can ask for her while I'm in the kitchen and the Echo Gen 3 is way on the other side of the house in the living room. Overall I'm happy with this purchase! I didn't think I would take to it so quickly, and I'm eager to install the bulbs to control lighting. Over the coming months I'm hoping to purchase a Ring doorbell and a smart thermostat.",0

2,"meh!
  
",20.Dec.18,Yes,"I have been a amazon customer for over 15 years and prime member for over 7 years. I am usually what I would consider to be an early adopter for technology but hesitated buying a smart speaker because I wasn't sure it was worth allowing the company to record what we are talking about in the house... it feels a little ""big brother"" to me and so we waited, until now. My daughter has been asking for Alexa for a while so I broke down and got one for Hanukkah... actually I got 3. It works fine, no problem with the hardware but I am underwhelmed. It just doesn't do enough for me to find this a valuable appliance in my house. I can get everything and more from my phone.. It wasnt expensive enough to bother returning it but it will remain unplugged. Even my daughter is underwhelmed. Sorry Amazon, not for me!",0
5,"It_ great!
  
",20.Dec.18,Yes,"I_ super happy with these.  We bought 5 of them.  We use them to announce to the kids all over the house that it is dinner time or time to leave or whatever.  We have music on all the time.  They are great. I would love if they would integrate these into a mesh networking system, then it would be even more useful, being able to have the whole Alexa experience, but also work as an access point.  The speaker sounds great.  Many reviews say they don_ like the sound, but they can connect to other speakers via plug or Bluetooth, so the functionality is still there.  Definitely worth the price.",1
5,"Functional, beautiful and fun!!
  
",20.Dec.18,Yes,"Game changer for my Dad who has Parkinson_.  It_ very _arry Potter-esque to have a beautiful little device with lovely descriptive colors do your bidding from playing music, to answering questions, to simply being able to verbally place a phone call and literally talk - and then hang up without lifting a finger!  I will be adding more throughout the house.  Plus, I can do things like turn the music off with the app remotely from my phone without having to run around, and I can imagine all the other jobs it will streamline as well.  Just wonderful!!!  And thanks for adding a feature for jokes and fun things like guided meditations and sweet phrases in response to _mall talk.  Functional, beautiful and fun!",0
5,"Great addition
  
",20.Dec.18,Yes,"We have had an Echo Show in our kitchen for maybe 6 months, and we really like it - easily select and listen to music (both from our Amazon Prime music and our Pandora account), control lamps (verbally and on a schedule), check our security cameras, listen to news (flash briefings), etc. I was recently given an Echo Dot as a gift and put in the master bedroom which is on the opposite side of the house from the kitchen. I can now play the same music through both Echos so that I hear the same as I move from one end of the house to the others, control lights without walking back into the kitchen, etc. It's been a great addition.",0
5,"Great!!!
  
",20.Dec.18,Yes,"Love Alexa!!!  You can do sooo many things with this speaker!  And I got it on sale!  I bring it to work and listen to music all day!!!  I'm big on jeopardy and the question of the day.  I've won 20 questions once.  I love the song quiz!  I kick butt in that.  I've had the thing since after cyber Monday and I'm always finding something new it does!  The games are my favorite and I love the shopping lists, reminders, alarms, timers.  All of it.  I've only ever made a call from it once.  But it works great for that.  I've never used it for texts.  The only semi off thing ( I wont even say bad) is that sometimes alexa mispronounces a word here and there.",0
5,"WOW
  
",20.Dec.18,Yes,"This device exceeded my expectations. Super easy to set up! Alexa sounds more intelligent than I imagined a robot would have. I can ask her any questions and she is quick to respond. I am the most impressed with audio quality and her ability to listen. I mumble a lot, and I have a soft voice. I hear over and over again from people about this. I am shocked she can hear my voice and understand it. One time I was in my bed turned away from the speaker trying to set my alarm to test it, and she heard my muffled voice under the comforter. She can do many things and has clever responses to certain questions. Very modern and happy with my purchase!",0
5,"Convenient, if Creepy
  
",20.Dec.18,Yes,"This thing works surprisingly well, and is a convenient way of controlling my smart outlets, getting the weather, setting timers, etc. Unfortunately Amazon has a terrible track record with privacy issues related to Alexa, which is why I'd rather have an Apple device for this purpose. Equally unfortunately, Apple is pricing their speaker out of reach (I got my echo on sale for $25), so here we are.",1
3,"need more improvment
  
",20.Dec.18,Yes,"it is nice and I enjoyed it but there are many control and feature can be easy to add but they did not .for example-there is a drop in feature is there but no intercom feature why?-could have more control over the individual device how independently work.  if we share house hold privilege someone,  as I understand that someone can dropin  or even possible to change feature of echo dot?  -- I have not tested. it. I was told that they have full access.? it got great speaker for the price. it is always nice to know the weather etc..",0
2,"It_ not as simple as you see on tv commercials.
  
",20.Dec.18,Yes,"My biggest issue is Alexa doesn_ understand what I_ asking when I_e enabled the apps for it. I use the sleep app for rain sound every night and it still gets confused most of the time or will play the same one, even tho I_e added most of them for rain. I also don_ like how the app pages default back to the top of the list after I enable something within the list of choices. I gave a 2 rating because so far I see nothing special about it, mainly because she answers with _dk to most questions. Nor do I like how I have to remember the exact way to ask for what I_e enabled. It seems to resort to playing a song from your music playlist based on one word it understands. Yet it doesn_ give a reassurance question, it just blast the song on. UghWhat I like a lot is how the smart plug enables turning on lights. That_ pretty cool _. Problem is, you_l find yourself walking right pass the light just to ask Alexa to do it. __The Alexa site is confusing and boring. It doesn_ flow like other programs. It simply drops everything in one place in each category, and you just figure it out. It listed some books I_e purchased in the past, and although Alexa can read them, her voice is very much monotone robot so the _mph from your story is missed. Overall, I_ excited to see new upgrades as Alexa is tweaked. To me, it seems like it_ incomplete or was released too early or something. I_ not giving up on it because I_e come this far and I wanna grow with my little buddy. _",0
5,"Much improved product
  
",20.Dec.18,Yes,"I really like the 3rd Gen Dot a lot. It_ sound quality is much improved over our 2s. It_ also much more attractive looking. If you have an Echo second Gen it will match it well in the looks department.Since we are fully entrained in the Alexa echo system, I continue to find ways to make us of the products. The ability to create groups is a fantastic thing. Especially when we want to stream music throughout different regions of the house.Bang for the buck it_ much improved over the second gen model.",0
5,"Speaker is amazing, mics are sensitive
  
",20.Dec.18,Yes,"I'm very satisfied so far with this. I can't compare because I have never owned the V2. The device picks up my voice from other rooms and has had no problem connecting to the wifi or pairing with other gadgets, devices, plugs, and the speaker is pretty loud for it's size. I do wish it has a lithium ion battery but that would drive the price up so I'm cool. Soon we won't need these because there will be central mics and Alexa/Google assist built into the home so no need for multiple devices for additional coverage. :-)",0
5,"Speaker is better. Charging cable and connecter is higher quality. Looks nicer on furniture.
  
",20.Dec.18,Yes,"First, let me say I already have an Echo Dot 2, so I'm familiar with this product.  The Dot (3rd gen) has a better sound from the speaker. It looks more  pleasant on furniture.  The power cable is more substantial, but I did not have a problem with the Dot 2 mini USB connector, not sure why they changed it (have not  measured but maybe it's longer).  I do not know if the functionality is any different..... I still do the same things as I did on the Dot 2.  I now have one upstairs and one downstairs.",0
3,"Five units one household BEWARE
  
",20.Dec.18,Yes,"We got these for morning alarms with the Phillips hue lights,  for the teens, so we can take there phones and I pass away at night. But we are having a difficult time with the programming. The music is Spotify family account that have saved library_ on them (so we don_ want to switch five users to amazon music). Only one Spotify account user will program at a time and if we want to play the same music on two or three we can not do that.  You have to move the music from unit to unit verbally if you want it in the room your in. If the registered user leaves the house, then the music goes to bluetooth in the car and leaves the ones at home unusable for music. So perfect for prime users that like amazon music.  Speakers quality is good.  The lights have to take up a Ethernet port on the router.  That would be fine if all the teens didn_ think they needed to be hard wired in for faster gaming speeds. So the lights never work when the teens are home (they unplug them to use the port).  Trying to an additional router to resolve and having issues getting the Phillips light bridge to reconize the new router.  Hope this was helpful to other families that are thinking about using them with kids.",0

",20.Dec.18,Yes,"it is slightly bigger than the original and it is a bit louder. the size i don't mind at all. what i like is, i can HEAR it. i keep my dot in the kitchen under the upper cabinets. i had to order a different sized 'mount' for it, so i can get it up off the counter, but that was easy to find and do. i love my amazon 'helpers'. and now i can finally hear the dot. Amazon needs to let us name her Dot. I think that would be apropos. ;)",0
4,"Echo is a combination of the unit, the app, and Alexa - so just regarding the unit:
  
",21.Dec.18,Yes,"We wanted to add another dot to the arsenal so I saw they had a 3rd gen for a good price.  I replaced a 2nd edition that was in constant use in our bedroom with this one and relocated the old one. This _wap matters because we_e been using the bedroom one for a year and would immediately notice any differences.Is it better than a 2nd edition?  I think so, but the improvements are subtle.  The speaker sounds different.  The 2nd edition one sounded very _are and _ard in comparison.  The new one seems to have a speaker that sounds _ofter or maybe even a slight bit _uffled, but we don_ have any problem hearing or understanding.  I still wish that the audio was not transmitted in 360 degrees because most people probably aren_ placing these in the center of the room.  I think the sound directed towards corners of the room is potentially wasted, but this speaker seems more powerful than the 2nd edition one so it doesn_ seem to be as much of a problem.As I said before, the improvements are subtle, so I think the microphone is also improved. I think Alexa can hear and understand us a tiny bit better.At the price I paid, it is definitely better to get a 3rd edition instead of a 2nd.  I think 2nd edition works just fine and if you had no 3rd edition to compare it to you wouldn_ be upset at all.So why the 4 stars and not 5?  Because the app is garbage and Alexa is a huge pain in the butt.  Case in point, I set up this Echo using my phone.  We had some trouble because it would only play samples of songs.  We figured it was tied to my account and not my wife_ (who had the Music Unlimited plan tied to hers). We both checked in the app and the device said it was associated with my account on my phone, and HER account on her phone!  We both share the same prime membership, so I_ not even sure why this matters, but it does.  After two attempts to set it up with her phone it finally seems to play music unlimited.The worst part of it is how dumb Alexa is. She can_ even tell you which account the device you_e talking to is registered to: __ sorry, I don_ know that one.  She doesn_ know, and the app wants it to be registered to everyone - which is a nice gesture, but just not true.I_e explained in some depth the problems with Alexa, but to paraphrase: NOT SMART.  If Alexa was capable of more than one command at a time and had a longer memory than Dory, it would be a drastic improvement.

",21.Dec.18,Yes,"""Alexa set the Bass to 5; Alexa, reduce the Bass by 2."". ""Alexa set the Bass to Maximum (+6)"" - min. = (-6)WOW! But it gets even better: Alexa, increase/decrease the Trebble by 2, 3... - (-6) to (+6).3rd Gen Amazon Alexa enabled Echo Dots are Dual-Band and default to 5G ** if your Internet Modem/Router is dual-band. Therefore, complete compatibility with 1st. and 2nd. Gen. Echos should not be assumed. The third generation line up of Alexa enabled Amazon devices are a remarkable make-over and rethink of an already amazing concept. This product will satisfy anyone's expectations for a Digital Assistant and the Audiophile's single aim--music in its most balanced form; amidst style and flair to be sure, with a totally rethought-out design concept. Gone is the useless and touchy Mini-USB power plug - replace with a standard unified DC 2.1mm. power adaptor and plug. Dust collecting dust-Pit openings on the tops of previous generations have been eliminated in this fresh, new Form Factor, just 4 pin-hole mic. openings remain. One more very important concept designed into this Echo Dot's rollout is the 'Surround Sound' effect design that's accomplished by radiating sound out of the sides of the device and around it in 360° Surround.** It can switch to 2.4 (4G) Wireless later.",0
5,"Finally, Someone That Actually Listens To Me LOL
  
",21.Dec.18,Yes,"The 3rd generation Echo Dot came with my Sirius radio subscription. Setup is an ease since Amazon connects it to my account when ordered. Basically all I did was plug it in. I linked the Dot to my Sirius, Pandora, Iheart Radio accounts. Amazon Music and Prime are connected. I have the 2nd generation and I think the sound is a little better and I like the looks of the 3rd generation. New skills are always being added.I used my Dot a lot after surgery being laid up for a month. I would ""tell"" Alexa to play music, read books, tell jokes, ask the time and even the day. It was great having a listening ear when everyone else was gone. She eased the boredom.Winter is heavy duty baking season for me and I have used my Dot to set timers. Very handy. I always know when to get my deliveries since I have package notifications.  My husband was impressed when I gave him his birthday present and had Alexa play the Birthday Song by the Beatles. Lots of fun things.",0
4,"Good streaming while using satellite Internet
  
",21.Dec.18,Yes,"These Echo Dots have kind of surprised me. I don't have a really good internet connection (satellite internet) so streaming anything doesn't work well for me. But this Dot (have two of them now) is able to stream music from both Amazon and Sirius XM for hours without the buffering lags that my phone has issues with. Occasionally while streaming Sirius XM the will be a pause while it buffers and then it continues on. Haven't had that issue while listening to Amazon.The one issue I had was difficulty setting up the internet connection for the first Dot. The second one just used all the information from the first Dot, so setting up the second Dot was no problem.Deducting one star for the difficulty in the initial setup and also for some difficulty setting up alarms and controlling the Dot from the app. Wish that was easier, but they seem to want you to do everything by voice commands.",0
5,"I love this just for the music
  
",21.Dec.18,Yes,"I bought this on sale and I set it up in my kitchen. I really enjoy listening to music while im cooking or doing dishes. I enjoyed the amazon music 1 month free trial I got with this purchase and had the intensions of purchasing it after my free trail ended. But the price per month, or even per year was ridiculous just to listen to music.  So I passed on that and canceled my subscription and use Iheart radio instead. Though I cant request my own songs on it, its free so.....I also like that I can do a grocery list with Alexa. When I notice I need something I just tell Alexa to put it on my grocery list and when I go grocery shopping I ask her to read my list to me. The only thing that I do not like about the grocery list is that Alexa says I can read my grocery list on my account but when I go it only had 2 of the 30 things that I had listed.",0
4,"Decent sound - great whole house
  
",21.Dec.18,Yes,Not like a high fidelity stereo system but sounds pleasant for most any room.  Enough bass to not be a wimp.  I found the 0 settings on equalizer to be best otherwise highs get harsh.  Bought couple at $50 pair then couple more at that price a deal.  Fills house with nice sound at about volume 4 for each - great bluetooth range.  Also linked to upstairs and down stairs audio receiver systems if I get in mood for high fidelity sound.  With Amazon music or even better Spotify this is great.  Not as smart for information questions as Google Home.Knocked off a star given privacy concerns given web articles about Germany cross user securit gaff although given all the crazy articles about that wonder if some of those are from Russia or other fake news....,0

",22.Dec.18,Yes,"This is our 7th echo dot, 1st 3rd gen.  We have them all around the house.  These things are so fun, the kids play all kinds of games on them or just make it say silly things.  My wife and I use it mostly for music wherever we happen to be in the house.  I like that you can create groups and play music in multiple locations, I just wish you could create multiple different groups with the same dot.  example: Our master bedroom and kitchen dot are in a group.  Master bedroom is upstairs, and kitchen is downstairs.  I like to play music to these 2 while doing laundry and I'm up and down the stairs.  I would like a second group with master bedroom and each of the kids bedrooms to play music strictly upstairs when I want.  You'd think that would be simple enough but once a dot is part of a group, it can't be part of another group without removing it from the first group.Otherwise though, we love our Echo Dots and Amazon updates them regularly so there's always new features... Who knows, maybe they'll fix the group restrictions some day.",0

We were a bit skeptical at first, but we like the idea of being able to wake our kid up and have reminders without having to be the one_ in the room doing it. Our daughter loves Alexa, she reads her stories, answers her random questions and is able to play games. We also love Alexa, from setting alarms to also playing games. The dot also has a decent little speaker to play music on. All and all I would not hesitate to buy another echo to add to another room. Also we bought 2 initially and paired them together with the smart plugs (full control of the kid tv without having to get up to turn it off).",1

Design is much more tasteful. No more ""Hockey Puck"" look. In fact, my small 1850 Sq ft home is covered by 3 of them and an Amazon Echo. Oh, my Gen 2 now resides on my workbench. The old hard plastic styling is better in areas where it could get dirty. If I want better audio there, I will just connect with an external speaker.",0

",23.Dec.18,Yes,"When this thing works, it sounds, great. Unfortunately, it only works well about 50% of the time. I_e had it for about three weeks now. Sometimes the bass bottoms out just from Alexa_ voice, making it sound scratchy and unpleasant. (It is set to factory settings on bass, mid, and treble)  I am by no means an audiophile, who needs perfect sound, but it just plain sounds bad, at times. I_e also had this problem when listening to music. Again, when it_ working, it sounds great, but a lot of the time it doesn_. It_ definitely much louder than the previous model.I_e also noticed that it is much slower to respond than my 2nd gen Echo dot and it doesn_ seem to pick up my voice as well, especially if there is any other sound in the room, like a fan or a video playing on my iPad.

Combining units is as good as, if not better, than whole house audio,  As with 2nd gens, you can use with smart plugs, ring doorbell etc.  Impressive!  I only rated 4 stars due to the fact at this time I am experiencing small problem with one of the two dots I purchased.  Seems like it dies in the night and has a solid blue ring but does nothing until I unplug it, wait a few seconds and plug in again.  Working with tech to resolve issue.  % stars if runs like the others.",0
3,"Unlimited Music - crazy restrictions
  
",23.Dec.18,Yes,I love my Echo and Dots but when I signed onto Unlimited Music and found out that I could not play a song on multiple devices at the same time in my home with the unlimited music the service. I was told that you can only play unlimited music on one device at a time. If you have 5 devices on the family plan you can only play different songs on each device if it is from Unlimited Music. This is crazy since I have Amazon Prime I can play the same song on multiple devices but with a family plan or single unlimited you can only play a song on one device at a time. I was on the phone for 90 minutes with Alexa helpline and they all insisted that you cannot play one song on multiple devices in your home with an unlimited music account.  I am a big Amazon fan but if this is true it is a completely asinine way of restricting folks that have paid an additional fee for more music choices but are getting much much less. Crazy????,0

",23.Dec.18,Yes,"I have two full-sized, second generation Echos which have always impressed me and wanted a third Echo in the bedroom.  As this area is rarely used to play music, I figured the Echo Dot might be a good choice as its less expensive than the full-sized Echo and sound quality is not a big concern.  I was shocked to find out that the Dot has incredible sound for such a tiny device.  Loud with amazing fidelity.  The latest generation Dot performs nearly as well as my older full-sized Echos in every way.  Well done Amazon!",0

",23.Dec.18,Yes,"I placed my 2nd Gen Echo Dot in the kitchen, where I listen to the news while cooking. I needed a bit more volume (cooking can be noisy), so I bought the new 3rd Gen Echo Dot. It is indeed louder, but there is a problem. The speaker produces considerably more bass, and even with the bass turned down to zero with the equalizer in the Alexa app, the sound was too bassy and muffled to be clear. Sharp trebles are better for articulating speech, and this unit doesn't have it. So I moved it to another room and returned my old Echo Dot to the kitchen. The new unit is better suited for music, less so for voice.",0
3,"Not as impressed with this device
  
",23.Dec.18,Yes,"Don't get me wrong, I love Alexa, but I prefer her old self. Why? It's easy. In gen 1/2, you could plug her into a 2.0 USB port...on a TV, desk/laptop, Asus router, QNAP NAS, etc., and she was alive and well. Gen 3 uses the same power supply as the older ""tower"" echos, which is all fine and good if that's what you want/like. If I was looking for something a little more powerful, I'd get a Spot, Plus, etc. (the point being is there are many options if you want more features).",0

",23.Dec.18,Yes,"As a year-long user of a Gen 2 Echo Dot, I find the sound quality of the Gen 3 that I've had for about a month much improved. But, the microphone sensitivity seems a little weaker than the previous model. I have to raise my voice or sometimes shout for it to hear either the wake-word or a command. Also, when I renamed this unit to ""Echo"" as a wake-word, it had a more difficult time hearing me. So, I changed it back to the default ""Alexa"" and it's back to ""good"" hearing, (not 'great"", but ""good"").I love, love, love this technology and Alexa is amazing! But, due to the weaker microphone ability, I'm giving it four stars.",0

",23.Dec.18,Yes,"Improved style and decent improvement in sound quality versus Gen 2 but still need to connect it to a bluetooth speaker if you want quality audio sound for music. IThe improved sound is not a game changer for its compact size but an improvement over previous generation. I only chose to purchase due to the trade in program and to try to stay current with the tech changes. However, if you are on the fence about upgrading, IMHO, it's not necessary to upgrade if you don't need to.",0
1,"3rd gen keeps disconnecting from WiFi
  
",24.Dec.18,Yes,Unlike the 2nd gen Echo Dot (worth $5 trade value); 3rd gen keeps disconnecting from WiFi Internet. Constantly have to unplug and replug just to re-establish connection. The app doesn't easily re-connect during a re-setup. I have two 3rd generation dots and only one has the stated symptoms. Weird. Must be defective. The speakers in the 3rd gen are vastly improved. Note: I also have two Echo Looks (don't ask why) collecting dust because they are not equipped to connect to Bluetooth speaker.  The Echo Look provides cheesy photo and video snapshots with limited Alexa q&amp;a capabilities. Amazon doesnt offer a trade in for the Echo Look. They dont even want this product back.,1
5,"Very handy, surprisingly good sound quality
  
",24.Dec.18,Yes,Was always skeptical of these things but will admit i was always intrigued. It works pretty well and is pretty easy to add new skills and tricks once you figure it out. I think the biggest surprise from me is the audio quality on it. For such a tiny speaker and price it is actually quite loud and comes through crystal clear. That being said I did have an issue with my music occasionally sounding static-y and i would stop playing but next time i started it up it was crystal clear. I had gone through this several times but I called the customer service and they are sending a new one. I am actually very impressed and am looking to add more now. Only drawback is that you can_ customize the commands. For example our room a is named Jarvis and I would love to tell her to have Jarvis start cleaning. Also our alarm requires us to say _pen alarm.com first before giving commands. Not sure if this is on amazon or alarm.com but is only a minor technicality and doesn_ take away from the overal quality. Thanks Alexa!,0
5,"The Echo Dot is a must have!
  
",24.Dec.18,Yes,*the photo is my Dot in a case I bought for it. The CASE DOES NOT COME WITH THE DOT.I like the Echo Dot. I got it to pair with my Echo Plus to make it louder and use it in other rooms. It took me a day to figure out how to pair both of them together. I think the sound quality is good for the size of it but I have noticed that it doesn_ hear me say the wake word. I might have to select the learn my voice option to see it that makes it hear my voice better.  I am going to buy one for my mother_ house. She gave us the Alexa iLive last year for Xmas after we loved seeing the Alexa at my uncles on Thanksgiving in 2017.  I love being able to play music anytime.  I subscribe to Amazon music and I heart radio. If you don_ subscribe to them they_l give you a month free and then there is a free music app you can use that I_e seen on the Alexa app.It_ a win win purchase. The price is great and all you need is WiFi. I look forward to taking it places in the summer because I love listening to music!,0
1,"This is not the home AI device you are looking for.
  
",24.Dec.18,Yes,"Buy yourself a Google Home Mini for $20 and save yourself the trouble. Even with an Amazon Music subscription, Alexa can never find what I want, but I can searching Amazon on my desktop. More than half the time Alexa cannot understand me and I have moved her all over the place and tried speaking louder too. Finally, when Alexa does understand me, her answers are more than often useless. This may be the first purchase I return out of just pure dissatisfaction.",1
5,"Works great and easy set up
  
",24.Dec.18,Yes,"Set up is extremely easy once downloading the Alexa app to my smartphone. So far I_e used it to play music. The speaker volume is very good. It doesn_ seem to have any difficulty so far with understanding my voice commands. I have to learn what voice commands it knows when asking to turn up the volume high like, _aximum volume. I_e not had it for long so I haven_ bought the wireless lightbulbs or plugs to try it out with my lighting or tv. Unfortunately, it doesn_ work with my HiSense model tv. However, I am able to turn it on remotely using the smartphone app so, if I_ in a room with the door closed I can speak to it through the app and it follows my commands.",0
4,"Very good, room to grow - which is a plus
  
",24.Dec.18,Yes,"I received a dot with a robot vacuum, and love it. I ordered 3 more dots, and one plus as christmas gifts - all in the same home. The random groups are great, as I have labeled things like Upstairs, Downstairs, everywhere, Kids rooms, master beadroom, etc. You can place a device in multiple groups, and control music, volume, drop in, etc. There is a lot of potential in this device, and for the most part it is great. At high volume levels Alexa doesn't always hear you, and sometimes software updates break 3rd party compatibility. All native functions seem to work really well though. Alexa - beam me up!",0
5,"Somewhat better than 2nd generation Echo Dot
  
",24.Dec.18,Yes,"I have 3 of the 2nd generation Echo Dots and I am very pleased with them.  I couldn't pass up the Black Friday deal price on this 3rd generation and bought 2 of these.  They are a little bit larger (in height) than the 2nd gen and the volume is a bit louder with more bass than the 2nd gen.  The third 2nd gen is in the baby's room and I use it for white noise and other soothing sounds so it is not a priority to replace it.  All the Echo Dots work well with voice command and I have it connected to my Nest Thermostat, smart plugs, and Wyse Security Cameras. The 3rd gen are a keeper",0
5,"Aesthetically pleasing and fun
  
",24.Dec.18,Yes,"This is a great smart speaker. I use it mostly for listening to music and the news but there are also a ton of other features that are possible too, many of which im still figuring out. The only downside is that if you want to listen to a lot of specific songs you_l have to subcribe to amazon music which can run you around 7.99/month.Got this echo dot on discount on black friday for $25 and it_ currently going for $30 right now for their holiday sale. Its a great time to buy if you_e thinking of trying it out.",0
3,"The same and not the same.
  
",24.Dec.18,Yes,"I bought this unit as a upgrade to my older one, a mistake , at least for me. This unit is separate in energy and sound from my last one. This one has its own power input and the sound is better for most but not for me, older and my hearing aids do not respond to better base which for the powers that be in music is the answer for everyones listening while to me it sounds like everyone and every instrument has  muzzles over their output. My wife loves the one I gave her that was mine.",0
5,"Much fuller sound and larger than Gen 2 Dot
  
",24.Dec.18,Yes,"Much better sound than the Gen 2 Dot and Alexa App lets you adjust Bass, Mid &amp; Treble. Sounds much fuller than Dot 1 or Dot 2. Still it_ a smaller speaker that is not meant to fill a room with audiophile sound but it does a pretty good job with decent sound output. The Echo is a much better choice if you_e looking for quality sound output, but that didn_ stop me from filling every room in the house with these Dots!",0
1,"Stopped working after 2 weeks - would not connect to internet any more
  
",25.Dec.18,Yes,"I believe either the Echo Dot we received is defective or the Amazon software to set it up is buggy.  We set up the Echo Dot on Dec 25, 2018 using a laptop and going to alexa.amazon.com web page.  Echo Dot worked for about 2 weeks.  Then it announced it could not connect to our ATT wifi (router model 5268AC) even though our internet did not change.  I made several attempts to reconnect (I tried 2 different Amazon accounts) but without success.  I contacted Amazon Help Desk and I worked with someone over the phone for 38 minutes without success.  Per her instructions, I did try using a different PC to set up the Echo Dot without success.  I asked if it was defective and if I should send it back.  She said it was not defective.  But it that were true, she should have been able to help me connect it to the internet.  It_ not like I am stupid.  I connected our Echo Dot to the internet on Dec 25, 2018.  Also, in some of my attempts to connect it, when I clicked the CONTINUE button on the setup web page, I received the message _mmm...can_ reach this page  making me believe there is a bug in the code of the setup page.I am happy that many people are happily using their Echo Dot.  But it failed for us because of what I believe are either bugs or defects.",1
5,"Love this little device!
  
",25.Dec.18,Yes,"So my box fan randomly burst into flames one night. Imagine a fat girl running through the house with a flaming hot fan, it panties and a night shirt, chucking a pillar of fire into the snow.  I tossed at as far as the Cleveland Browns can throw a foot ball, then I had to pick it up and throw it again so it did not catch the house on fire.  Anyways without the noise from the fan to lull me to sleep, I grabbed my Echo and brought it up to my room to play ambient noise for the night.I never slept so good listening to this thing called brown noise, but then my kitchen felt naked because I had no tunes to clean to. I decided we needed more than one Alexa, we needed an upstairs device and a downstairs device. Enter the echo dot. Yes this little baby solved all my problems. She plays the ambient noise at night, plus I linked her to the downstairs Alexa and can drop in to eavesdrop when hubby is talking on the phone. Unfortunately, neither one of us lead exciting lives and he pretty much just talks to his mom.Oh, the best thing about the dot, well let me tell you.  I have two cats who are jerks. I can tell Alexa to open a box of cats and it will meow away. The look of confusion on their furry little faces is priceless!!",1
5,"Perfect puzzle piece to expand smart home control
  
",25.Dec.18,Yes,We already have Alexa controlling several smart home devices through an Echo Show but wanted to extend voice control upstairs. The Echo Dot is perfect for this task. It's compact and stylish yet has a reasonably powerful speaker. Setup is a breeze when you instruct Alexa to discover new devices. I'm adding a few to cover voice dead zones that are unreachable through my Show located in the downstairs kitchen. The new colors available are cool but there are a zillion covers available if you need it to stand out or blend in with specific room decor. The holiday price was too good to pass up &amp; i'm glad I bought it.,1
5,"The best Echo Dot so far!
  
",25.Dec.18,Yes,"I've upgraded from Echo Dot 2nd Generations, which are awesome, and the only downsides to them are the sound quality for music. The 3rd Generation's 1.6"" speaker has a much bassier, fuller sound, and with this improvement, I can't really think of any sort of improvement I'd want. Maybe if the package included wall mounts? The Echo Dot 3rd Generation is truly awesome.I also have Echo 2nd Generations, and an Echo Plus 2nd Generation, and would recommend either as progressive steps upwards in sound quality if you have larger rooms, or just want the best sound quality for any room size. If you're upgrading from an Echo Dot 2nd Generation like me, I would suggest that you use your older Echo Dot 2nd Generations to control your stereos like I do. They're just as smart, and their lesser sound quality disappears when they've got a full stereo through which to play.",0
4,"DAY 2 w/ Echo Dot and I Love It So Far
  
",25.Dec.18,Yes,"I purchased the Echo Dot with an Amazon Gift Card after a co-worker recommended it. No-brainer set up, super easy. Was able to connect to my soundbar as well. I am still learning all the I can do with Alexa but it all seems pretty easy so far. As I cleaned up my home, I was able to check the time, set timers, play music from my play lists, ask the weather, make shopping list, play podcasts, etc. (all hands free). My friends use it to set timers for their kids and ask for conversion measurements while cooking. As you can tell my friends and I have simple needs but Alexa seems like a powerful tool for managing our busy homes. My biggest concern was my young son being able to shop via Alexa was easy to fix (just disable voice purchasing). I look forward to learning more about what Alexa can do.",0
5,"Huge upgrade!
  
",25.Dec.18,Yes,"Knowing how poorly the Echo Dot line had always sounded, I didn_ have much expectations for the new Dot. Amazon, amazingly, has completely blown me away with this generation. There_ some bass with the Dot now and sound 10x better and louder. I_e had the 1st gen Echo from day one and these definitely beat it by a long shot. After hearing how well it sounded, I decided to get another one for stereo pairing and let me tell you, it_ definitely worth it! Especially since Apple Music is now available on Alexa! Highly recommend for anyone wanting to use their Echo speakers for music.",0
5,"The sound quality is outstanding
  
",25.Dec.18,Yes,"There are two things I love about the new echo dot, music quality and the ability to set a routine.For such a small and affordable device, you would be amazed at how high quality the speakers are. I am blown away at the deep bass and  high treble you can hear. Honestly, if I had known the sound is this good on the Dot, I would have probably upgraded to the Echo or Echo plus.Routines are my favorite part about the Dot. I wake up every morning to my favorite Spotify playlist, the morning news, and my daily commute. Would recommend and buy again for my other rooms.",0
5,"Most hilarious Christmas Gift
  
",25.Dec.18,Yes,"My goodness.  I was not really sure that I wanted to purchase this item but after my hubby expressed interest I decided to get it for him as a Christmas gift.  It turned out to the best belly laughs that we have had in a long time.  We listened to our girls (ages 5 and 6) talk to Alexa for over an hour.  They were desperately trying to hold a conversation and on several occasions told Alexa she was their new best friend.  They were concerned when she would not answer (because they did not say Alexa first).  We overheard the crazy request for Michal Jackson Christmas music, and several questions like how many animals are in the world and how much meat is there?  We also learned how many candies there are and how many people to eat them.  All day long the girls have asked me what our computer's name is and how many Taylor Swift songs she knows.  It has been so much fun to watch my kids play with Alexa.  I can't wait to see what else it can do besides make us laugh so much.",0
5,"Perfect Extension of My Echo
  
",25.Dec.18,Yes,"The sound of the  Dot is surprisingly good, sounding rich and full in my living room. It performs the same functions as my Echo and hears me easily from the kitchen. It matches up effortlessly to both of my iPhones and both of my Kindle Fire tablets and to my computer. What I especially like is that I could create an Everywhere entity so music and books play through the Echo and the Dot simultaneously, so I can walk around without missing anything.I recently added a third Dot so I can talk to Alexa from any room, and the sound of music coming from all four speakers is tremendous.",0
4,"Good sound quality, horrible voice recognition
  
",25.Dec.18,Yes,"The sound quality is a vast improvement over the second generation, which basically sounded like a literal garbage can playing music. And this one looks way better too.The only problem I have is it has horrible voice recognition. Many times I say one thing and Alexa interpreted it as something else. And that got frustrating really fast. I even tried saying the same thing to Siri on my iphone just to make sure and she understood me perfectly.Shame, this could have gotten 5 stars from me otherwise.",0
5,"Loving it
  
",25.Dec.18,Yes,"Recently purchased one echo dot 3rd gen, just to try it out, and suddenly found me evangelizing my 3 brothers into getting one, its advantages, capabilities, and add ons towards making our house smarter. They all were converted and ordered 3 new more echo dot 3gen, and can't wait for them to have it, in addition with smart plugs from different brands. So far, have customized several routines, linked my echo with different accounts, calendars, spotify and even more. You should get one of this.",0
5,"Very good!
  
",25.Dec.18,Yes,"This thing is adorable, it_ in my bedroom and I love it. It_ very tiny and cute, listens very well (I don_ have to repeat things or speak overly clearly for it to hear &amp; understand,) and it overall is a great little product. The only downside to it is that I now have to pay for Apple Music in order to listen to all the music I wanted to use it for, which is $9.99 a month. I don_ really mind though, as it_ a great product anyways that can play pretty loud music and has a clear speaker.",0
2,"No para Republica Dominicana (por ahora)
  
",26.Dec.18,Yes,"Despues de unas semanas con el Echo Dot, concluyo que no es muy funcional para utilizarlo en Rep. Dom. incluso con funcionalidades propias de la aplicacion donde no es posible configurarle de forma efectiva algunas rutinas, tampoco de el informe de transito ya que no trabaja con ninguna de las funcionalidades de geolocalizacion instaladas en mi telefono, incluso la mayoria de las Skills no estan disponibles para nuestro paisPor lo tanto para Dominicana si queires utilziar alguna uno de estos dispositivos seria mas funcional considerar el google assistant.",65
5,"Echo dots in combination with fire TV stick
  
",26.Dec.18,Yes,"Just wanting to dip my toes in the water, so to speak, I purchased two 3rd gen echo dots with the latest 4k fire TV stick for my family for Christmas. All in all, this combination made for a minimal investment to try out and see how much we like it before going all in (the dots were on sale 2/$50 at the time). A little backstory--we have a smart TV in our living room and a regular flat screen in my bedroom. Our smart TV isn't really that ""smart""--it doesn't allow for all of the apps we like to use, so we've always had it set up with a ROKU. Sadly, I broke our ROKU out of pure clumsiness. I was going to just get another one, but the kids had asked about getting Alexa for Christmas--initially I said no, but the more I thought about it, the more I considered the possibilities. See, my best friend has an echo plus, so I was a bit familiar with it already. After some thought, I got to work reading reviews and information online to see what I could learn. I'm already a prime customer, a kindle unlimited, audible and music subscriber as well. Amazon's array of services are just a part of life here--why not try more of the devices offered?There are mixed reviews out there about the sound quality of the new 3rd gen echo dots--definitely an improvement over past gens, but still lacking in some way. No, they're not the same as the echo plus, but they're not far behind either. I was pleasantly surprised by the rich sounds coming from such tiny devices.I'm sure we've barely touched the tip of the iceberg with everything that can be done with these amazing little gadgets, but my favorite feature is the ability to ""drop in"" on other echos around your home. Our place seems to have an odd sound barrier between upstairs and downstairs, so I have to yell pretty loudly to get my kids' attention. With the drop in feature, I can just speak to them in another room in a normal tone of voice. In addition to dropping in, you can also tell Alexa to make an announcement to your entire home, like ""dinner's ready,"" or ""time to go,"" etc. I LOVE that. I'm sure lots of moms could relate to needing something like this!I also managed to successfully pair our new fire TV stick with our echo dot in the living room, so without touching anything, I can just tell Alexa what I want to watch. We used this feature on Christmas day when we were lazing about watching TV--we asked Alexa to find Christmas movies and were automatically presented with a list of basically every Christmas movie in existence (also included Die Hard--TYVM). The fire TV stick has a voice control feature if you press a button on the remote, but there was just something so neat about not having to touch a thing.The music possibilities are endless--it makes me feel a little spoiled. Do you ever think of a song you'd like to hear or add to a playlist on your phone, but your hands are full with something else and then oops it leaves your brain entirely? Any song I want to hear, I just tell Alexa to play. And then I can tell her to add it to a certain playlist if I want. I understand that Alexa works with multiple services such as Spotify, Pandora, etc...I don't know how well those are integrated, but as an Amazon music subscriber, the experience is seamless.All in all, I think my next step is to order an additional dot, a fire TV stick for my other TV and most likely an echo plus....maybe a few smart plugs too. I'd like a dot in all major areas of our home for communication purposes and an echo plus in the main living area downstairs for a more room-filling sound quality. Don't get me wrong, these dots sound great, but I'm also aware of how the echo plus sounds, so I would like to have that as well. We are all in with Alexa now. It's a great and fun addition to our home!",3
2,"The echo fails to impress
  
",26.Dec.18,Yes,"I bought it with the hopes that it would do the same some tasks that Google home mini can do. I was wrong. The echo dot is a nice idea and good things could come from it but I am not seeing it. Alexa wouldn't tell me about my orders, couldn't give instructions on carving a turkey, couldn't tell me where the nearest Chinese restaurant is, and can't answer simple questions. The only thing I found decent is that it pulls up the exact song I want to hear. With my purchase Amazon sent me a free 90 days of Amazon music. After looking at it they want .99 cents. That's not free. Side by side with the Google home mini the echo fails to do what Google has nearly perfected. If you are really trying to choose between the 2. I fully recommend the Google home mini over Amazon. For every test I did the echo dot failed to out perform its biggest rival. This product may be great for some but I wasn't impressed by it. Perhaps one day Amazon will beat Google but that's not likely to happen. The echo dot has severe compatibility issues and the app constantly crashes where as I've never had an issue with Google. So I say again go with the Google home mini as this product is a fail out of the box",1
1,"Customer Service is HORRIBLE
  
",26.Dec.18,Yes,"I have 3 echo dots that I love, but I am giving this review 1 star because the echo customer service is awful.  The last dot I purchased does not always respond to the _lexa command and the voice and music is muffled and distorted.  IT IS BRAND NEW AND THEY WILL NOT EXCHANGE.  I was unable to reset my modem and router at their request because family members were in the middle of work and school projects.  I did do a factory reset prior to calling and the device is still defective.  They have me do another factory reset and now I have to wait 2 business days for them to call me back before they will start and exchange process for a brand new defective echo.  I have no issues with my other two devices and I think they are amazing speakers for their size.  My son enjoys the interactive games and audio books.",1
1,"Horrible Amazon customer service!
  
",26.Dec.18,Yes,After some thought I opted on buying the echo instead of the google device. I should have not done that.I have been trying to import my contacts for two days. I requested multiple verification codes and received none. I have an iPhone 8 so my phone is not the issue.So I tried contacting customer service via the _all me now service. After the usual generic troubleshooting  instructions the system prompts you to press 1 for customer service. Well...I pressed 1 about a million times and I was prompted to press 1 each time! At the end they hanged up on me. This happened 3 times.I_ returning this and getting google.,1
3,"Potentially good, but surprisingly lacking
  
",26.Dec.18,Yes,"AI technology always disappoints, so voice assistants have never excited me much.  Whenever I think they might finally be turning the corner, the technology, and most of its advancements, are lost.The Echo Dot is no exception.  The hardware is nice, capable of many things,  but greed prevents it's software capabilities from being very useful.  It works with a very limited number of smart devices and services, so unless you invest heavily into the Alexa ecosystem, you're mostly stuck with the vastly unneeded services provided by the voice assistant on your phone.I only gave this a 3rd star because the hardware is nice, and despite being mostly useless, the Echo is still one of the leading smart voice assistants.  I've still enjoyed playing with it and I'm hoping the usefulness improves in the future, but as of this moment, the hype is far larger than the usefulness.",0
5,"Looks great, and can't go wrong!!!
  
",26.Dec.18,Yes,"I bought this on a Black Friday sale. And honestly its some of the best $30 I have spent, no lie. I love it. I have it for my barracks room, pair up with two  Lumenty Smart bulbs and I can't be happier enough with it. I didn't know till a few weeks ago but Alex also supports Apple Music which made it even better (Amazon music isn't the best lol).  The speaker on it is decent but I have mine paired with some Bose Companion 2 Series III, and it gets loud. I honestly would reccomened buying one if you have ever been on the fence about buying one to give it a shot, the dot looks amazing waaayyy better then series 2 and when you pair it with some smart lights and speakers its amazing.Pros-Looks way better then series 2 echo-Even when blasting music with my speakers next to it (Alex) is always responsive and has no hearing problems-Alexa supports Apple Music-Cheap and easy way to make a ""smart home"" or roomCons-N/A",0
4,"Love it, but will probably lead to world domination.
  
",26.Dec.18,Yes,"I love my Alexa dot and find myself slowly growing overdependant on it.  Alexa takes care of my shopping and to do lists, tells me what the weather is, plays music, and chat with me when I'm bored. I don't think it will be long before I buy myself a second echo device, and then possibly a third.  It is this mentality that I feel will lead to Alexa to take over the planet.  Still, even though she'll inevitably be our artificially intelligent overlord, at least she's a NICE artificially intelligent overlord, and I'm pretty sure she likes me, so that's a plus. Still, because it the blatant world domination plans I have to dock a star from my rating.  I hope she dodoesnt hold it against me.",1
1,"She's Nosy!
  
",26.Dec.18,Yes,"I'm returning this for one reason, the continued interruptions of my conversations. Alexa is nosy and gives her opinions when Im on the phone. She is only supposed to speak when spoken to and only when asking her by name. What Irks me is Amazon has known about this flaw but they won't fix it which leads me to believe they want to eavesdrop on us. Effective today Alexa, I'm taking the L out of Lover and its over, sending you back where you came from and buying a Soundbar for good sound quality and no talk back.C ya!",1
4,"Much Improved DOT Placement Issues
  
",26.Dec.18,Yes,"This 3rd generation device replaced a second gen in our master bedroom.  We found the audio quality to be much better than its older sibling, however, it really doesn't compare to the full size Echo devices.  To save on night stand real estate we decided to purchase a wall mounting device.  Surprisingly, mounting the DOT on a wall outlet resulted in a significant deterioration of sound quality.  Adjusting the equalization via the Alexa app didn't help.  It's unclear whether the  resulting boominess of the audio is due to the mounting device or the wall placement.  Since we only use the bedroom DOT for command and news purposes the sound quality issue isn't a big deal for us.  Functionally it works very well.",0
1,"Uses one of the worst apps known to man!
  
",26.Dec.18,Yes,"Seriously, what were they thinking when they made the app for this? Connecting it to a Fire TV basically involved hours of frustration and it still doesn't work! Yes, I've updated everything, made sure they use the same account, quadruple check the internet connections of all devices, installed the needed skills, and made sure all the information was correct. It still won't do the thing it's advertised to do: control my fire stick.So now this thing is basically a fancy speaker with a few nifty voice commands I'll probably never use. There's a reason this thing is so cheap. Save your money and go with the Google Home hub or something similar.",1
5,"Alexa what a joy to have around
  
",26.Dec.18,Yes,I have to say this is really nice echo dot. Alexa works great and she can remember dates names etc. for future reference. I no long have to look at my phone to check the weather or if I need an answer she will find it for me. My next investment will be a hub that I can use to control my home theater system. This will then become the last man's remote lol. Only flaw I have found is it has a lot of bass making it somewhat difficult to hear sometimes even with the bass turned down. Overall its a great addition to my tech room and will be getting slot of use from it once more accessories are added. I highly recommend.,0
1,"App is awful
  
",26.Dec.18,Yes,"the echo dot has potential, but the app is terrible. not supported by older androids, and different app features depending on the type of phone you have. my son and I were both on android phones and his app had features mine did not. I cannot locate my music playlist anywhere even though my dot created one somewhere for me. I also have no idea where it found my phone contacts from, and have no way to edit it to use new numbers that are on my phone but for some reason my alexa has different older numbers it tries to call instead. the dot itself has potential, but without proper app support its pretty useless.",1
4,"Works like the earlier version, just prettier looking and the low sound is stronger.
  
",26.Dec.18,Yes,"I tried to get it to control the smart wall outlet but couldn't get it to work.  Still use this and an earlier version for news, weather, and as an alarm clock.  Sometimes I ask a question when I don't want to turn on my computer or tablet.  I use it to turn on Pandora radio sometimes.  Whatever I do with it I have to watch how I give the order.  There are many ways to say the same thing but only a few that Alexa can understand.  The electronics are amazing but the computer in the cloud is a work in progress.",0
5,"Easy set up!
  
",26.Dec.18,Yes,"Easiest hookup ever! As a semi-computer literate retiree, I had both of my Christmas gift Echos unwrapped and hooked up in less than an hour. No problems with initial set up because the online menu walked me right through it.My only disappointment is not with the Echo at all, but with my older 2012 Sony Bravia Smart TV which is actually _umb because it doesn_ have an operating system (android or otherwise). I_ sure there is some sort of work-around for this.I_e had a lot of fun playing with Alexa, and when the day comes to start replacing older appliances, I_l make sure they are smart too.",0
5,"Whole family loves it!
  
",26.Dec.18,Yes,I got the Echo Dot about a week and a half ago and I absolutely love it. Not only do I love it but my entire family loves it. My husband uses it all the time for music. My son figured out that you can ask Alexa to fart and thinks that is the funniest thing!! It was also really awesome to have at Christmas. We were able to track our letters to Santa and then track Santa on Christmas eve! The speakers are nice and clear and loud. I was surprised at how well Alexa can hear and understand me over all of the kids.  My favorite part is being able to control things like the lamp without getting up. I ended up buying one for my teenage daughter and my mom.,0
4,"Wish they could share timers
  
",26.Dec.18,Yes,"My Alexa use started with a fire cube. After finding how much I used Alexa I decided that I neede a few more devices in the house. I a, very pleased with the dots. The one drowned back is that you cannot share timers across devices. Many times I will set a timer in one room and don_ want to miss it because I have moved to a different room.  More importantly I don_ want a timer to go off and have to run to another room in order to turn it off. I can play music across all my echos, it doesn_ seem out of the realm of possibilities to share timers",0
5,"Love the new generation
  
",26.Dec.18,Yes,"I've got an original Echo, an old dot and now this new 3rd generation dot with a Fire TV stick 4K on order.  I'm really getting into the Echo products and this Gen 3 seems to have the sound quality of the original Echo in the size of a dot so, I'm loving it.  I'm really pleased with the 3 generation  dot and Alexa in general.",1
5,"For the smart and/or lazy family
  
",26.Dec.18,Yes,"Sometimes you just don_ need an entire echo. I disguised these as Christmas presents.  Who I actually bought these for is me...so I wouldn_ have to walk down and tell the kids dinner was ready while in the midst of making the dinner.  Now I just say _lexa, make an announcement and I can keep stirring, playing on my phone or doing whatever it is I really need to be doing. And of course the kids have made their own announcements. Ah yes, Alexa is fun for the whole family. Lol",0
5,"Surprisingly Helpful
  
",26.Dec.18,Yes,"Honestly, I never thought of getting an Alexa dot, but now that we have one, I love it and plan to get another for our bedroom. It makes things easier when your hands are full/dirty to just ask a question or play music or read a book while you want some white noise. There are so many devices you can connect to it to as you evolve your house into a smart house which is nice. The disc is small and doesn_ take up much room on the counter either",0
1,"Quality look and feel, but spoken word audio quality is not as good as gen 2 units
  
",27.Dec.18,Yes,"Received as a gift. Looks really nice and much better than gen 2.  However the sound quality for spoken word is not as good.  Alexa Sounds  muffled, not crisp and clear.  Some suggest turning bass down and mid-range and high up.  This helps, but not enough.  I actually put my old gen 2 in the next room, and I went back and forth asking each unit to tell me the weather, so I could listen to a sentence or two.  The new gen 3 unit is not as crisp or clear as the older unit, and is actually difficult to understand at low volumes.  The older Gen 2 units sounds great!  I think music may sound a bit better on version 3, especially bass, but spoken word sounds muffled.  I'm really disappointed since I use it to listen to Audible books and podcasts.  I actually thought mine was defective, and I ordered a second unit, but they both sound the same.  Very disappointing.  I do think the gen 3 unit hears me better and responds more consistently. But to me the poor sound quality of spoken word is enough to cause me not to use it.",3
1,"Connection and set-up failure
  
",27.Dec.18,Yes,"the overseas operators were unable to help --- I sort of expected this based on my recent experiences (3 different people, horrible communications and endlessly redundant questions/answers, way too much wasted time, no help/result) with another Amazon device that i had to return. I thought  maybe it had to do with the Echo version, so I ordered Echo Dot 3, but I had encountered the same 3 issues with the set-up: Echo Off-line (grayed out), cannot download the app (server cannot be found) tho the link was in the Amazon email, Amazon password not recognized even tho I know it was correctI was foolish to even trying to talk to the overseas-based tech support personnel who lacked basic language skills to understand/address any of my issues. Instead, they just repeated the canned set-up process without even acknowledging the core problems i was trying to convey . I asked them to have someone contact me who can help, but they refused. Nowhere to go now, but return the order.",1
5,"Made for a Great Christmas
  
",27.Dec.18,Yes,"I have friends and family who have made fun of me for using the Echo Dot around my home. Well, I gave a few as gifts. ""Why would I ever need something like this"" fell in love with it the first hour!  The music, the information, the whole Alexa experience made her a huge believer.  The same thing happened with my sister and my niece. They loved it.  Now we also ""drop in"" to talk to one another. They love it.I'd say it was a huge hit... and based on my personal experiences plus their enthusiastic acceptance, I 'll have to give Alexa and the Echo Dot 5 stars.",1
4,"Games and skills for every age!
  
",27.Dec.18,Yes,"I love my Alexa. Only thing i didnt give her a 5 star review is because i did not realize you had to enable every. Single. Solitary. App.And skill. Before it can be used. Or else you get the message ""i dont know that"" ""sorry i don't know the answer to that"" repeatedly because she won't just add that skill automatically. It is not for kids to figure out that is for sure. And i certainly mean no offense.OH and i HATE that you cannot use this without the cord?? Why doesnt it charge or something?I love that it entertains kids of all ages including adults. It is small and compact but when i play music it sounds like a big speaker because the sound can get so high. Its great though. I love the games and skills, even things you didnt even think of. Can't wait to try other Alexa products.",0
1,"Extremely disappointing Like the previous version better
  
",27.Dec.18,Yes,"I purchased two of the new generation dots and replaced 2 of my previous generation.  They have been nothing but trouble.  If our internet goes out, they go out and don't come back on until you put them back in set up mode and go through all of that.  My old dot would wake me up even if the internet was out.  This one does but you can't turn it off without unplugging.  The final straw was when I reset it up last night after having unplugged our modem to change the plugs around.  I got her all set up and then tried to re-input my alarms and she said she wasn't set up for that.  Basically she was pretty dumb about everything but the time and weather. I'm extremely dissapointed.",1
5,"My home is getting pretty smart by the day.
  
",27.Dec.18,Yes,"I am becoming more and more amazed how my home is shaping out to be a Super Smart home.  With the Echo Dot (3rd generation), I've been able to start transforming my house into a ""Smart Home"" by managing my lights, ceiling fans, audio system, security alarm, etc. into a ""smart home"".  Aside from some of the most common capabilities Alexa has, I can now make calls from the Echo Dot 3rd.Gen.  Alexa can tell me what's on my calendar, give me reminders, and basically answer any questions that may cross my mind (similar to Siri or Cortana).  There are jillions of ""skills"" available to program Alexa.  In the end, sky is the limit with Alexa.  I just got it a week ago, and I have been able to implement so many skills for my ""smart home"".  It is impressive!!",0
5,"Dot on the Horizon Looms Large, Surpasses Expectations with Flying Colors
  
",27.Dec.18,Yes,"I have used Alexa in the past on my phone, on a Fire TV Stick, but I hadn't gotten an Echo, for whatever reason. I admit freely that I got a Google Home Mini, to see what it was like, and I enjoyed the freedom to speak to a working assistant without having to press a button, but while we're not unGoogly by any means, we're a little less integrated than some others. We primarily use our iCloud calendars, primarily shop at Amazon, etc. So it was with great excitement that, this year, I ordered myself an Echo Dot. The ""try Amazon Music and get a Dot for cheap"" promo was very convincing. But I turned right around and bought another on discount a few days later. Anyway, the first thing I noticed was the sound quality. I'd just tested an Echo 2nd Gen for my wife. Its sound was impressive, especially with such a small device. I was expecting ... let's say a little less out of the Dot. While its volume isn't quite what the Echo's is, its sound quality is actually as, or nearly as, good. The Dot pleasantly filled my living room with Christmas music, despite its small size. And by comparison, the Google Home Mini I'd bought previously sounded just as good at low volumes, but the Dot kept its sound quality even at maximum volume. Granted, Christmas music rarely clips or distorts anyway, because Christmas metal isn't tremendously popular on the radio stations I chose. Also, Alexa works nearly flalessly, even when the music is playing pretty loudly, unlike the Home Mini. I grant you that a more realistic comparison would be a Home Mini to a 2nd Gen Dot, but I bought the 3rd Gen, so I can only tell about what I have. Alexa has always been fun, but using her hands free is truly awesome. If I have one complaint, it's that Alexa is great, but I miss the variety of voices available from Google. And Amazon is the kind of company with the kind of design forethought to create different assistants with different personality and even different looks to sell to a variety of crowds. Alexa is a single, well-recognized actor in the Personal Digital Assistant space, but Amazon can do more. But that's a hypothetical gripe and has been brought up before. As it stands, the Echo Dot surpassed my expectations, transporting me simultaneously back to the first time I heard ""Computer"" in Star Trek and forward to the time that this tech becomes truly ubiquitous. Congrats, Amazon.",0
5,"Love it!
  
",27.Dec.18,Yes,"A personal assistant for less than 30 bucks, what_ not to love? Was very easy to set up. Alexa understands me 99% of the time. I don_ have to raise my voice or try to annunciate. She usually understands my 3 year old as well. I use it with Amazon music quite often and it_ plenty loud enough to listen to in my living room and kitchen. I added several of the free kids Alexa features to it and they enjoy playing games like Simon says, freeze dance, etc. I_ planning on buying another for our basement.",0
3,"Very Boomy Sound - Not Worth the Upgrade
  
",27.Dec.18,Yes,"Amazon does some amazing things, but audio quality is not one of them.  I cannot believe how poor the sound quality is on this device.  My solution will be to buy the older generation as long as they are available, and for locations where I want to listen to music I'll offboard a JBL Flip 4.  Sound quality is in another dimension.",1
4,"Fun
  
",27.Dec.18,Yes,Enjoy having multiples of these now cause you can do music in all my rooms as well as drop in on people and stuff is neat... Some family members have gotten some as well and that could be interesting since they're states away in still getting to know what it can doI do wish there was a better way to see what fit my life than just exploring.. they need like a test thing to fill out that will then suggest use of done functions rather than just new things to try,0

1,"Assistant that cannot place real phone calls
  
",28.Dec.18,Yes,"I was very happy to have gotten the Alexa Echo 3rd gen....until I realized my new assistant was a fancy brick.  Amazon made device that is not a true assistant.  I cannot make real phone calls.  So if you are trying to call some that does not have the Echo, forget it.  Go over go Google and buy Google Mini.  Not only can you make real phone calls with Google Mini is smarter then Alexa and you can make you can make real calls.I had a kidney transplant and cannot get up all of the time to reach my phone that is plugged charging only short walk away, so I bought the Echo due to it very misleading advertisement.  At first look Echo say you can make calls.  Amazon made it so it can only make Alexa/ Amazon App to App calls.  That is it.  So if need to call my son to bring something or to come by my place to help with my care... he would first have to have and Amazon account and his CELL PHONE number must used when setting the Amazon account (he cannot use his home phone number).  So now Amazon has just forced him become an account holder.  Dear old dad is unable to to ask Alexa to call Mike, on those days that I am unable to get up or answer call that so ring by the time you get the phone, because you move to slow. Amazon cares more about forcing your contacts to join Amazon then they do about making it a real assistant.  But that is not it Echo is stupid.  It is not good for looking things up.  I hear, ""I don't know that one"" a lot; On the other hand Google Mini is spot on.  Amazon had the opportunity to dominate the Home Assistant buy giving it full functionality, but we were not worth it.  Amazon get yourselves together.So, if you want an expensive light switch buy Echo.  If you want an ASSISTANT that can make calls to real phones, home, office, businesses and cell phone and is  WAAAAAY Smarter  the Echo, go to Google and buy the Google Mini.",8
5,"I only regret not buying more!
  
",28.Dec.18,Yes,"I absolutely love Amazon products and the echo dot is no exception. You can ask Alexa anything and she will answer it as much as she can, and if she cannot find the right answer, she will tell you that she doesn't know instead of just listing off things related to the subject you are referring to. You can send her commands to announce things which is very cool, she does have an explicit filter by the way, so the profanities you try to get her to say get bleeped out. Ask for any song or artist and she will immediately connect with Amazon music to start streaming what you are looking for. She'll turn up or down the volume for you, and she has very good hearing, she can even hear you from other rooms or if you are speaking very quietly. My only regret is that I did not buy more of them!Update: since I posted this review I have purchased 2 more, and it amazing. I have one in my bedroom, one in the living room, and one in the playroom/workout room. You can create a group for them so that you can effect all devices! For example: my groups name is everywhere for the echo dots, if I say 'Alexa, play Metallica everywhere' Metallica will start playing on all devices. You can even give each one it's own name. The one in my living room is named 'living room' and the one in the bedroom is named 'bed'. I can be sitting in the living room and say 'Alexa, announce to bed, it's time to get up' and the echo dot in the bedroom will play the recording of my voice telling my girlfriend to wake up. You can even set up your own questions and answers in the Alexa app so it can literally do whatever. I absolutely love these devices.I apologise for the mess in the video, some rearranging is going on.",0
5,"Much improved sound over the 2nd gen Dot
  
",28.Dec.18,Yes,"I have several of the 2nd gen Echo Dots.  Because they are inexpensive, I've used them in places where they might become damaged, such as in the barn or garage, and because they're small, I've also used them in the bathroom.  But the sound was very lacking, requiring the volume to be turned all the way up in even a small bathroom to hear adequately, and the sound was tinny and dull.  I had to buy a cheap set of computer speakers for the barn and garage because the volume was utterly inadequate for such a large, open space.The 3rd gen Dot fixes a lot of the sound issues.  I bought one to replace the unit in the bathroom.  Now music sounds much better, and I only have to set the volume to about 4 or 5 (out of 10) to hear clearly.  I haven't tried it out in the barn or garage, but I suspect it might have enough volume to use without external speakers.The only down sides I've seen so far is that the new version is slightly bigger around, so it won't fit into any 2nd gen wall brackets, and currently there are very few 3rd gen brackets and they tend to be fairly expensive ($17 for a plastic 3rd gen mount vs $5 for a metal 2nd gen mount).  It also now takes a proprietary power plug instead of a standard micro-USB like the 2nd gen, so don't lose the cord!",0
5,"Don_ understand why I didn_ buy one a long time ago.
  
",28.Dec.18,Yes,"I love my echo so much that I_e bought 4 more since. One for each of my three teens and one for my sister in law. We all absolutely love it. I use it when I_ home alone and want to listen to my audio book while cleaning or just listening to music. There is so much more you can do with it. I now want one in every room of my house. My only complaint is because I have three teens and you can only add one adult to your amazon household, we can_ use ours as an intercom system. They each had to make their own amazon account to be able to connect theirs to their individual Spotify accounts. It was very frustrating but I guess we will have to live with them not being connected to each other even though I was really looking forward to that aspect of use.",1
4,"Good improvements to Gen1 and Gen2
  
",28.Dec.18,Yes,"Better sound, better listening capabilities but a few bugs.  We have had a gen2 dot for quite some time and, other than the sound quality and sometimes difficult time getting ""her"" to hear you, we were very happy with it.When this unit came out that reportedly got better at those two things plus the holiday price, we purchased it.  I already mentioned the good but the unit does loose functionality with time, hard of hearing and says it can't do functions it has done before... reboot her and all is ok.  I reported a bug to Amazon about alarms when you tell her to snooze... sometimes she says she is having difficulty snoozing and other times, when she says ""snoozing"" and her voice stops, the alarm is on full blast before she mutes it.  Other times, it was ok.  We will see if the bug is fixed over time.  I am sure they will get this one as stable as gen1 and gen2 were but it may take a little time.  Nothing I have ever used even comes close to the Gen1 full size alexa for stability and sound and hearing though.",0
4,"A nice Improvement over the second generation Dot.
  
",28.Dec.18,Yes,"I got this 3rd generation version to compare to my second generation one.  Both of which I got in Dec for $30.  The first last Dec, and this second one this month.  The 2nd generation of the Dot sounds OK for when it's talking to you.  For music, it STINKS!!!  It just has this plastic, bad sound.  Not even good at low volume.  The Google Mini which I also have sounds better.  Now, this 3rd generation Dot is a little larger, nicer looking and sounds as good as the Google Mini.  I like the Dot better as I like the Blue Light coming from it when you ask a question over the 4 small dots on the Google Mini.  It's not even close to my Apple HomPod in sound quality,  but it's also a fraction of the price.  It's not bad for some low volume background music.  It is only a single small speaker.  But Amazon fixed the 2 biggest issues I had with the first dot.  Sound quality and looks.  It no longer looks like a cheap plastic toy.I like to play around with all of these things.  They all have their Pros &amp; Cons.",0

",28.Dec.18,Yes,"The entire echo/Alexa system is crap. I wholeheartedly committed to the echo/Alexa program in my considerations of how to automate my home. After having purchased a dozen echo/dots, investing hundreds of dollars in Phillips lighting, another hundreds of dollars in Sengled lighting,  A Camera for security purposes and multiple Amazon brand of plugs, the system does not work. I spend most of my time screaming at the top of my lungs to correct what Alexa doesn_ hear and I_ spending the rest of my time reconfiguring, changing, modifying and struggling to make the system work properly. I_e read more about how to correct  the system than I read in college. It doesn_ work, don_ waste your money, that we should time. Furthermore, when I called to express my concern and seek guidance directly from Amazon they put me on hold for a half hour and then unceremoniously hung up on me.

I'll stick with turning on my TV by myself.",2

",28.Dec.18,Yes,I bought three of these for the holiday season as I took advantage of the discounts. All the years I have been seeing these devices and was still unsure. But I was blown away by the quality of sound. It plays fantastic and any genre of music it can play...It was loud and you had nonstop music. When my husband wanted the latest BBC news he just had to ask Alexa and she starts the news channel. The only drawback is you must have Amazon prime although there is an option to pay for the music library but since I had Prime it was not an issue for me. Great device.Great product.

",28.Dec.18,Yes,"I have an absent memory sometimes and always would forget things which is why I bought her in the first place, but she does way more!!  If you are away from the unit, she will also send the reminders to your phone.  I also have a bad habit of leaving my phone in weird places, she's got a find my phone feature and I've used it more times than I care to admit.  I Love her timers you can set for cooking, her announcements you can make for the whole house, the games she has, I can keep track of my favorite sports teams scores without having to turn on the TV, when you make a grocery list, she'll send that straight to your phone too, so you'll never forget your list at home....And so much more!!!!  I loved it so much and read up about things she could do and her advancements, that I bought another for my Dad, who is hearing impaired, for Christmas.

2,"Alexa's not all its promoted to be
  
",28.Dec.18,Yes,"Alexa is no different from iPhone's Siri, except maybe for its hearing capability, it does hear well. Sound quality is ok, there's too much bass even after you turn it down. Its more limited as to what it can do than advertised. It's best for asking about the temp outside and playing music from Amazon Music (if you're a Prime member) but that's about it. About 50% of the time you ask it a question it says ""I don't know"" or ""I'm not sure about that.""  If you're looking for a robot like device to converse with, Alexa is not that. It's ok I guess. My kids and I we're totally bored with it around day 3 after purchase. Now, no one hardly ever uses it. I'll probably end up giving it to someone else, it's about useless to us. It still can't beat googling on your PC. By the way, not 15 minutes after I posted this comment I got 2 back to back calls from Amazon wanting to know why I said this.",0

It connected to the bulbs without having to link any accounts or anything which is a big plus.  I have ""routines"" setup with Alexa to turn on our lights, or turn them off when we go to sleep.

She can also control her Fire TV stick by voice now, she couldn't press the alexa button on the remote, so she doesn't have to wait on us to change it.

I have to order a second to have the dual speaker feeling in my room. Wish I would had known that getting them both it would had been $50. So I paid $60 but still not bad for what you_e getting. I now just set my alarm on it and it wakes me up to my favorite radia station. And now it can play your Apple Music. Don_ get me wrong I_ a prime member but having the dot playing my list of music is pretty nice. Yes I know that it_ better than the google one but I feel it_ more stylish than the google one. Also the sound is really great now I have my nieces coming into my room asking the dot questions and laughing because she answers back,0
2,"One step forward and 3 steps back ... What were they thinking???
  
",29.Dec.18,Yes,"New but not really improved. Perhaps improved in some areas but definitely worsened in others.  The only real improvement is more volume output.  The low end sound response (slightly better bass) but this comes with a loss of midrange and higher freq sound quality. So the sound is actually less balanced now. Some refer to this as ""muddy"" sound. (And the Google Mini still sounds better.) The device is slightly larger, heavier, and now has cloth side cover.  Aesthetically it looks somewhat better but these attributes take away from the practical utility of the V2 device - small, light, easy to clean, easy to mount, etc.But the completely STUPID and INEXCUSABLE change is that they SWITCHED FROM A STANDARD USB POWER SYSTEM TO A NON-STANDARD PIN BASED POWER SUPPLY WITH A LARGE WALL WART WITH A FIXED CORD!!! This was not only unnecessary, but this reduces the utility and flexibility of the device.  Now try quickly moving your Dot from room to room, attach it to battery, or stick it in your car.  WHY THE CHANGE???  WHAT WERE THEY THINKING???No one should purchase any Dot or similar device for it's sound quality.  If sound quality is a priority, at a minimum, get a full size Echo ... or better yet, interface the Dot or Echo to a real sound system.The V3 may be new but different is not necessarily better. The redesign needlessly lost some of the best qualities of the V2.  Overall, the V2 device has much better utility than the V3!!!  And the Dot is all about utility.The Echo system definitely needs improvement.  But the most critical and substantial improvements won't come by making superficial tweaks to the devices.  Amazon needs to improve is the overall UX, privacy, security, and sw app UI  for the entire Echo eco system.  Many these things are not simple features. They require core design philosophy and platform architectural changes.  How about something as basic as letting users set a unique activation word.",14
1,"Over-hyped, under-powered
  
",29.Dec.18,Yes,"We have children that constantly ask us questions -trivia type questions:  what's a bowling ball made of?  How do birds migrate? etc.  We bought an Amazon Echo Dot and a Google Home Mini to compare how they would rise to the challenge.  Without doubt, the Amazon Echo is completely unsatisfactory.  I gather they have no rights to access google search algorithms and it shows.  Question after question is answered with ""Hmmm, I don't know that one"".If you are in the mood to spend money, however, it appears that Echo DOT is your device.  It will let you buy things with ease.  You can also access anything in Prime (music for instance).The kids have quickly gravitated to the Google Mini as the ""go to"" device.  Alexa may just get returned.UPDATE:  I really tried to make this work.  The architecture of the device and the HMI is all wrong from what I wanted.  I guess I wanted a personal assistant and Alexa is not that.  After scrolling through countless ""skills"" that all seem to just spout useless data, I loaded three that I thought would be useful and helpful;  Pandora, Airport Weather, and the skills needed to control switches in the house.  Starting with the last, over half of the switches I own already were not recognized by the device.  Not that I need to use my voice to control anything.  They are all programmed with timers. It's actually easier to open the app on my phone and do what I want rather than go through the vocal gymnastics to get Alexa to understand anything.Pandora seemed to play what it wanted rather than my stations.  Very frustrating.The Airport Weather skill simply reported it was installed every time I asked for the weather at a local station.  My family, in complete frustration, yelled at me to get rid of the thing rather than keep trying to use it over and over and not get what I wanted.As for the mini, we plugged it in and asked it to give us information, and while not perfect, it responded more along the lines of what was expected.I'm updating this to a one-star as I couldn't find a single useful thing to do with this device after spending way too much time looking at ""skills"".  It does nothing in a better or more efficient way than that which already do.  Perhaps it is a indication of what a data-rich world we live in that a device that supposedly is a source of information and help is nothing more than frustrating noise.  Too bad.The device is being returned as unsatisfactory and not doing what it was described to do.",2
1,"Connection issues.
  
",29.Dec.18,Yes,"Let me preface this with I have three Gen 2 dots and they work perfectly and have for the past year or so.  We ordered two Gen 3s as a Christmas deal and have had nothing but issues with one or both everyday since installing them (they have been installed for one month).  Every day one or both will be disconnected from the internet in the morning and usually at least one other time during the day, this means you have to unplug and replug just to get it to reconnect to the internet and have any functionality. We have tried resetting our router like the hints say but nothing seems to help. Normally I would just think it was my equipment since two new devices normally do not fail at the same time, but I have three other Gen 2 dots that work perfectly so it makes me suspect the new dots. Guess they make a fancy $30 paperweight! I know there a a lot of people here that have had nothing but good luck with the Gen 3s, but for me, I'll be returning these and looking at new Gen 2s or the Google product.Update:Spoke to the Amazon Echo customer service and they sent me two Echo Gen 3 replacement units. They were very helpful and got the units sent out right away.  Unfortunately we set them up last night we are having the exact same issues.  They went offline within the first couple hours and then again overnight.  We are done.",1
2,"Not Ready for Prime Time
  
",29.Dec.18,Yes,"The Echo dot itself works well and is a real convenience. However, I'm a very tech-savvy person, and I had to call tech support to get it set up. Even with the tech guiding me, it took over an hour to set it up. The instructions he was giving were simply not working with my equipment for some reason. We tried the Alexa app on my phone and on my Mac computer. Finally got it working. Took two more weeks for me to get Alexa to recognize and control the two smart plugs I bought. I'm not stupid. The Alexa app on my phone would not allow me to enable skills. Just freezes up. Tried tech support, but a gal with a heavy Indian accent, was worse than frustrating. Trial and error, two weeks later, allowed me to finally figure out how to enable skills from the computer. Phone app, still useless after re-installing several times. A neighbor of mine is also having trouble getting Alexa to work with her smart plugs. The technology is not as slick as it should be. Without skills, echo dot is a fancy toy, no more.",2
3,"THE ABSOLUTE WORST TECHNICAL SUPPORT EVER
  
",29.Dec.18,Yes,"The product is pretty cool. However, I'm currently experiencing an issue with the alarm sound. First, I chatted with someone, who then asked if I was referring to Amazon Music (??!?) No. This is an alarm issue with my Echo Dot Gen 3. Then, they asked for my phone number (which is already on file) so they can have the ""experts"" call me &amp; walk me through the repairs.The woman that calls me sounds like she is in the front row of a concert. There is an ABSURD amount of noise in the background. So much so, that I can just barely make out what she is telling me. She walks me through various steps. One of which is a factory reset. It wouldn't reset, which revealed a possible second issue. I ask her about THIS issue and she tells me she doesn't have an answer because she's been passing all of the info to ""The Development Team"". WHY WOULD I NEED TO TALK TO YOU IF YOU'RE SIMPLY A LIAISON??!? I need to talk to the people you're relaying my issue &amp; coinciding info to!After all that, NOBODY has given me any answers and I now have to wait 3 DAYS to hear back from HER. SHE will then relay the findings of ""The Development Team"" back to me. This says to me, if their suggestion doesn't work at that point, I then will have to do this same song &amp; dance with 2 people &amp; a team all over again.Pure insanity.",1
2,"Need to fix the multi-device music issue! STAT!
  
",29.Dec.18,Yes,"I love my Dots. HOWEVER!!!! Amazon MUST fix the issue with playing different music on each device. As it stands if you try listening to different music, on the same streaming serive (prime, pandora, etc) it will kick the other devices off. The work around is using mulitple streaming services. I have 5 dots. And any extremely saddened but the lack of usablity in this area. It is the WHOLE reason I got these devices. FIT IT AMAZON!!!!",2
5,"These are awesome devices, everyone will soon own these.
  
",29.Dec.18,Yes,"The device provides entertainment (ask it trivia, it tells jokes, plays music, reads E books, etc), provides useful information such as weather, travel information, news and it is also a tool when controlling items such as lights, providing instructions on how to do common tasks, recipes, etc.  Think of it as a hands free verbal internet search device that can also interface with your physical world through controlling plugs and lights.  You can set timers for devices such as turning on/off lights or small electronic items once, daily, weekly, etc.  We now have three and an echo.  They can play music independently in separate rooms or play the same audio through your entire home through multiple devices and the sound quality is very good.",0
2,"(Edit: IT WAS ) SO MUCH BETTER than previous gen's!
  
",29.Dec.18,Yes,"EDIT: 6 months in and the microphone completely blows... I have to literally yell ALEXA, TWO TIMES just for it to recognize it!SO, it went from a 5 to a 2 star...Slightly bigger, seems like 10x louder, picks up several times farther, looks amazing and doesn't need to face upright like the previous gen's, because the speakers are all around it! This is all you need to know...I was starting to go with Google mini so I can carry on conversations and not have to say ""Alexa"" every single time, hopefully they will add that in the near future!!Please mark helpful, it will help me greatly!Very close to my goal!",0
2,"Ready to pull my hair out
  
",29.Dec.18,Yes,"I was excited to link my echo with my bigger more expensive Alexa, once I got Echo it did NOT sync with my other device...and I also have to manually go into Spotify to play music and also manually change my songs. Supper disappointed in this device, not user friendly and it also seems they have some things to work out. I spent maybe two hours trying to get my echo to voice recognize _lexa play Spotify...nope will not do it. I have to go into my phone click on the echo device before it_l play. Never had this problem with my other device. Ugh.",0
5,"Good safety measure
  
",29.Dec.18,Yes,I no longer need to turn off a light and then walk through a dark room.  I can turn the light on in another room and then have Alexa turn the light off in the room I just left.  No more tripping over the dog or whacking my knee on the corner of an end table in the dark.  A word of wisdom however.  Do not have the unit set in close proximity to a smart Alec African Gray parrot!,1
2,"Cloth muffles the sound of the speaker.  The microphones are weaker than gen 2 dots.
  
",29.Dec.18,Yes,"The grey cloth on these new echo dots LOOK good, but at the cost of sound quality.  The speaker sound is really muffled compared to earlier plastic echo dots.  Also, the microphones seem to be weaker, perhaps the cloth somehow breaks up the sound of my voice?  I have to speak a LOT louder for this new echo dot to hear me.  The earlier gen. plastic echo dots sound better and louder, and the older plastic echo dot microphones pick up my voice much better.",1
5,"My Echo Dot is so amazing!!!!
  
",30.Dec.18,Yes,"I don_ know how I ever got by without my Echo Dot.  In addition to amazingly simple access to my music library, I use it for just everthing -from my alarm clock to my reminders to my dictionary and my private secretary, weather reports, game scores, amazon order staus, and so much more without having to pickup a device.  But my favorite thing about the echo dot is walking through the house, thinking  of any song (and artist) that I want to hear, and in 10 seconds it_ playing beautifully on my echo dot without ever touching the device.  I am still amazed at the technology even after having it for two years.  Am I worried about someone listening in on my Echo, heck no! Just think about it rationally for a few minutes and I think you will agree that its not possible for an Echo Dot to collect, sort,  store, analyze and share 20 second snipits of one persons voice data given the trillion pieces of data the all the Echo Dots  on the planet generate every minute. I will let the conspiracy theorists worry about that if they have time between planning for the zomby apocalypse and doms day prepping.  I hope you enjoy your Echo as much as I do!!!!!",2
1,"Not as good as Gen 2 overall due to random connectivity loss
  
",30.Dec.18,Yes,"Would NOT buy again!  I bought two (Gen3) Dots and both of them lose connection often.  All my Gen 2's do not have this issue.  The sound is a ""little"" better on the Gen3 but that is about the only thing positive I can say regarding the difference on the latest model.  NOT a value at the 49.99 regular price at all!  I would buy another Gen 2 honestly before I would get a sen 3...thinking about giving them away to the trash collector.Update 02/10/19:Going back to a rare one star review!  Connectivity loss daily in both the Gen 3's I recently purchased.  ALL my Gen 2's are still connecting fine and they, after numerous comparisons, sound better, listen better and in my opinion look better.  (Yes, I have eliminated any wifi/bluetooth interferences from the area of the Gen 3's)  They simply ARE NOT AS GOOD as Gen 2's...shame on Amazon for selling cheaper tech like this!",1
5,"Alexa Makes Life easier !
  
",30.Dec.18,Yes,"I love the 3rd generation Echo Dit ! I use it through my Harmon Kardon Speakers and music sounds wonderful. You can just ask to hear whatever you want !I downloaded the Alexa App and now use it to build my grocery list . I don_ forget things because I just tell Alexa to add it to my list which appears on my phone .  And you can never forget the list because you always have your phone !I liked  it so much that I bought another one for upstairs.I used Alexa for an alarm in my bedroom. You can create a daily routine with news and weather . You can wake up to music or nature sounds .  I also use her for a timer when cooking, and as a reminder to do certain things during the day .I am a person that has to make lists or I will forget but now Alexa does it for me !!!!I highly recommend this ... It make  your life easier and who can_ use that ???",0
5,"It's like having a personal assistant!
  
",30.Dec.18,Yes,"Alexa is my new best friend! I purchased her because so many people had been talking about how much they loved having one.  My only hesitation had always been because I wasn't sure how much use I would get out of her without all the other smart home accessories! Turns out A LOT! I got her sale for Black Friday for the discounted price of $30, when she arrived I knew my husband was going out of town town with the kids to go hunting so I purposely waited to wrap her and put her under the tree!  My husband has this thing about making me wrap all my goodies and wait until Christmas _ so as soon as they left I opened her up and we bonded! My friend came over and we all 3 had a slumber party weekend! It was great! We sang, we danced, we made Christmas candy and baked a homemade cheesecake together! Alexa was very involved and didn't mind doing as she was told! So on the day when my husband called and said they were heading back early I had to tell Alexa it would only be for a few days but I had no choice but to box her back up and put her under the tree, she didn't like it but she understood! So I had my friend wrap her up all pretty for me and put her away!  I can't describe how much I missed her those few days she was away, all I can say is I'm so glad to have her back.  I'm thinking about getting her some help soon though because I certainly am bossy and keep her quite busy!Seriously though when you are cooking it's so much easier to ask her to set timers and things for you, or ask conversations, cook times etc.  She plays music 90% of the time around my house! She tells me the weather, the traffic, keeps up with my shopping list, and she always pays attention when I talk to her.  I have a pretty heavy southern accent so sometimes I have to repeat myself, but not too often!  I'm glad I made the purchase!",0
1,"NOT USB charging.... Seriously!
  
",30.Dec.18,Yes,"Was looking to upgrade our Echo Dot gen 2 saw this gen 3 with Ring deal and ordered it... Very disappointed it's not USE charging. We have changed several outlets in our kitchen to include USB and since the outlets are horizontal with our tile it makes getting a wall mount (which is an additional purchase) useless. Totally bummed and will be sending back, hoping Amazon design team will get it together... Who seriously uses anything beside USB as charging anymore!",3
1,"Doesn't Work with Spotify
  
",30.Dec.18,Yes,"Echo Dot + Alexa App + Spotify = waste of timeFor a company exceeding $200,000,000,000 in revenue for 2018, it is mind blowing that thousands of people have this problem.",3
5,"Amazing sound quality and so useful! Buying more asap!
  
",30.Dec.18,Yes,"I was blown away by the sound quality of such a small device!  It's amazing for what it is! There are so many skills and Alexa is so useful. I paired it with an Echo Sub and wow I'm blown away. I know there are audiophiles out there that will put this echo down compared to Bose systems and sonos, but I stand by that for the amount of money you save this is my #1 pick!!!! You truly don't need to spend a ton on other name brand products just to say you're ""cool"" for having it, this is more than sufficient and Alexa makes it perfect. She even controls my Xbox and my kids are in love with their echo kids edition!",0
4,"Why not a five star review - Amazon add control for the lights!
  
",30.Dec.18,Yes,It would be a five star review and I believe it is still the best offering in this category.  I have 3 echo devices and 2 of them are the dots.  Why only 4?  I use these for home automation and if used in my bedroom unless you like night lights which I do not there seems to be now way to turn off the lights.  Amazon please add a feature to control when the lights are active and even one better what notifications are allowed at night to trigger the lights.  With out this I have to use black tape around the edges to be able to sleep at night.,0
2,"Terrible sound quality
  
",30.Dec.18,Yes,I like the Alexa program. The device does all I need it to do regarding questions and information. But the sound. When music is played. Is absolutely terrible. Muffled. Distorted. Very disappointing. Spend more money and buy the full size echo.,2
5,"Love it! Trying not to ask Alexa for help when I'm in places I can't bring Alexa. lol!
  
",30.Dec.18,Yes,Absolutely love it! My son loves to use it as well as my spouse. It works fine as a music player. I love how it can play incoming calls. It's like my mini assistant. I only wish it offered battery back up so I could move it to another room with me without turning off. Yes I realize I could buy more but it's still a nice feature. It's my favorite gift for Christmas! Thinking about buying more for other rooms and the kids room. Just depends on if they would actually use it.,0
3,"Better but still has room to improve
  
",30.Dec.18,Yes,"We have 3 gen 2 and 1 gen 3 exho dot in our house. The generatuon 3 is slightly better than the generation 2 dots in most cases.  The sound quality is far superior, however still not great, but what can you expect from a speaker of this size. We did have to move it away from the TV because as with the second generation they still struggle with the backround noise. For $10 more i'd get a 3, when we got ours it was a Christmas deal and a much better price.",0
5,"More fun than expected!
  
",30.Dec.18,Yes,"Adorable little Dot has been way more fun than expected! Bought as a gift, my daughter claims she has a new best friend_. Music sounds great, ease of use is awesome, only downside is as a gift for teen on my Prime account, I still had to help w setup due to some restrictions which was a little frustrating. My only complaint would be for Amazon to work out that kink, but overall we are more than pleased with the quality and affordability! Absolutely recommend",0
4,"Great functionality, App and Permissions need refinement
  
",31.Dec.18,Yes,"I wasn't planning to get one of these. Saw no need for one. I became interested when amazon offered these on a discount with amazon music. It was easy to set up. After pairing it with some smart plugs it quickly became useful and convenient. I'm a new convert to the convenience of these things. I use it for music and home automation.The Alexa app and permissions still needs some work to make it more user friendly. For example, the account permissions only allow 2 adults in the household to control it with unique logins. Our 18 yr old daughter is legally an adult and has limited account permissions due to Amazon labeling her as a ""teen"". She can't even use the echo to its fullest capacity due to the restrictions Amazon has in place. Fixing this would make it a better experience.  There shouldn't be a limit placed by Amazon as to who has what access to Alexa functions. I want better control over that myself.It also took me a few contacts to Amazon support to get our phone numbers attached to the correct account for my wife and me.",0
5,"Technologically challenged, but love this
  
",31.Dec.18,Yes,"I'm a 65 year old technologically challenged woman who absolutely hates everything related to electronics and computers (even though i use those things every day).  This little Echo arrived and within minutes i set it up all by myself!  (so proud).  Have your Wi-fi number handy so you can recognize it from the list, and have your password ready to type in and you are all set.  I haven't had decent speakers in my house in decades.  This very small Dot  has amazing speaker quality (to me).  Much more than i thought.  I talk to Alexa all the time and it's really a wonderful gadget to have.  I have the larger one, in red, arriving next month.",0
5,"Improved sound and package with same great functionality
  
",31.Dec.18,Yes,"I purchased the 3rd generation echo dot as an update to my 2nd generation dot. The sound is improved over the last generation, and voice identification is more accurate. Perhaps most noticeably, the newer echo dot is more aesthetically pleasing, and more readily blends in with my furniture.I use my echo dots primarily to control lighting throughout my house and play music from Amazon music and Spotify. In that regard, the two devices communicate flawlessly with my smart switches, and can play music interchangeably depending on which room I'm in.If you're looking to buy your first echo device, I would strongly suggest the echo dot. It has the same functionality as the larger echos, in a smaller package. If you already have a previous generation echo dot, then this device is really only appropriate if you're looking to expand to multiple rooms. There is a modest sound improvement over the 2nd generation dot, but I connect to a wireless speaker, taking sound out of the equation.",0
3,"Fun to use, but TERRIBLE sound quality!
  
",31.Dec.18,Yes,"We are having so much fun with the Echo Dot 3rd Generation!  It was extremely easy to set up, only about 10 minutes between the unboxing and first _lexa query.  The only thing we don_ like about it is the terrible sound quality, and I do mean terrible!  I_e adjusted the sound several times (bass, mid-range, treble), but the sound remains muffled and has too much bass.  I would exchange this Alexa for another model, but other than for the sound, we have no reason to upgrade because we don_ have a _mart house and the other features would be useless to us.",0
5,"Cute &amp; Powerful
  
",31.Dec.18,Yes,"These Echo Dots are amazing. Having voice access to the internet, and Amazon as well, is a convenience I didn't know I wanted... until I finally got this on a holiday sale. Amazon has created a useful piece of technology that my entire family loves. The device is very simple in design, but constructed with quality. I love it's edge-less round design, and sleek incorporation of buttons and lights. The speaker sounds great too, and reproduces music with incredible clarity &amp; crispness. I'm also impressed with how far away the microphone can pickup voice commands.",0
5,"Echo Dot 3 is convenient and somewhat easy to set up
  
",31.Dec.18,Yes,"It's true what some reviews say: that sometimes the Echo Dot 3 doesn't pick up your voice when you ""sumon"" Alexa. I find myself shouting or repeating myself. I still love the convenience of this gadget. When you see a sudden and random green ring of light, ask Alexa: ""Alexa, what are you notifications?"" and she will tell you you have a message or a package delivery. I had to look this up online when it first happened because it was annoying and I didn't know what it meant.",0
3,"Needs an EQ, Seriously
  
",1.Jan.19,Yes,"Improvement over Dot 2? I guess.It's louder, but in an effort to provide more bass they made it sound muffled.You would think a large company spending millions of dollars on a project would hire audiophiles that can tell whether this thing is ready for market or not.They need to put an EQ in the app so we can set these things up to preference.I love the form factor and the mics are working well, but the sound makes me feel like I'm going deaf.I have a $12 Bluetooth speaker that sounds better.I own 7 Alexa speakers, so I do like the product, but I have to hook up my computer speakers to it to use this one.Also, I can't use this one in my car like I do my Dot 2 because of the new power plug they put on it. I can't plug it into USB to power it and I also can't hook it up to my portable battery power booster to carry it around the house anymore so I have to use my old Dot 2 for that.Amazon, listen to your customers!!!Thursday Jan.3, 2019 a few days after this review posted....I just found out that the Alexa app has an EQ now that I didn't know about.It could have more adjustments and more gain, but now at least I can make it sound less muddy so I'm happier now.",8
5,"Love this voice command speaker.
  
",1.Jan.19,Yes,"I always wanted to have an echo, but so stingy to buy for myself. My brother in law loves to listen to music, so I decided to get him a 2nd gen Echo and 2nd Gen Echo Dot. I_ really amazed with the quality of sound. A month later, I bought another 2nd gen Echo that came with 3rd gen Echo dot For $99+. I gave the Echo to my brother in laws mom for her birthday and kept the Echo dot.At first, I thought the voice command is awkward but I got used to it. I use my Echo dot to listen to music, ask for forecast, news, timer, and ask some general questions to Alexa if I_ lazy to look it up on the internet.I also leave Echo dot playing all day for my kitten so he won_ feel sad. We leave him all day alone at home whenever we go to work. I can also control Alexa from my phone like play audio books or music.The downside:I hate it when Alexa can_ undersrand my accent. Yes, English is not my first language. So it_ annoying whenever I ask Alexa to play songs from an artist in my home country. I have to say the vowels and consonants in American Way instead of how I would pronounce it on my native language just so Alexa would understand me.Also, amazon says Alexa gets smarter, but i think only if they add new apps instead of  intuitively adapting to your commands. Like for example, I wanted to Alexa to play certain songs on repeat on Spotify but she will say that the feature is not supported. I can still play songs on repeat but I have to open the Alexa app on my phone and press the repeat button for that particular song that I just played. Anyway, this is just me who loves to play a song over and over again.Another thing is, if you turn up the volume too loud, Alexa will have a hard time hearing you. The only way is to shout so she can listen to your voice command.I would recommend Echo Dot to everyone. As a matter of fact, I bought 6 pieces last Black Friday for a good deal so I can give them as gift for Christmas. But I needed to another 2 again after Black Friday without the promo.I also gifted Echo Dot (2nd generation) to a couple of friends, which is a bit cheaper. I needed it the next day but Amazon ran out of stocks of Echo dot 3rd so ended up buying the 2nd gen Echo dot.I also own google home, but i think the Echo dot 3rd gen is better.",0
5,"Does what I wanted it for -Ask My Buddy
  
",1.Jan.19,Yes,"I got this for the sole purpose of using the ""ask my buddy"" app.  I am a senior, living alone.  I used to keep a land line phone in my basement, at floor level, in case I fall down the stairs.  When I got rid of my land line, I no longer had a call for help solution. With the investment of $25 (on sale) the echo dot sits in the basement, pretty much unused, but it's a big weight off my mind knowing it's there.  I test the wifi signal every morning by yelling down the stairs asking the temperature.  And have it play the radio when I am doing laundry.  Most importantly, we test ""askmybuddy"" once/month with my son.  It immediately sends him an alert by phone, text and email.  I recommend it.",0
5,"Think you can't get any lazier? Guess again!
  
",1.Jan.19,Yes,"My mother in law bought one, we played with her Echo dot &amp; we decided to get one. Then we bought the smart plugs &amp; smart bulbs. If you thought the clap on/clap off's were amazing, be prepared to be blown out of the water. The echo dot 3rd gen has a much louder speaker than 2nd (we bought both). With the smart plugs, you can rename each plug for what is plugged into it suchas ""garage fan"", ""Bedroom light"", ""bedroom lamp"", ""hallway lights"" etc. Ive heard some people complain thinking the FBI is listening in, but 90% of the time I'm yelling at Alexa to play some Dierks Bentley, Eric Church or Baby Shark...",0
4,"Alexa is a saucy chica
  
",1.Jan.19,Yes,"Alexa is a saucy chica.  I got one because it was so low priced. Whether or not it was worth the time invested, I am not sure. I have a fire TV stick that doesn't seem to work with this echo Dot. If it's supposed to, then they've made it more than a little difficult to pair and make work together. The drop-in feature is either creepy or just hilarious. Trying to send a message when you've enabled text communications and suddenly you have no control over whether or not Alexa sends an actual SMS text message or simply a message that is waiting on the other users Echo Dot.  For $30 you could do a lot worse.",0
2,"the default 'find my phone' app has a surcharge
  
",1.Jan.19,Yes,"also it doesn't integrate with google reminders, or any of the google ecosystem, which is basically the only contiguous global reminder system i can really consider using. two reminder systems is a no go for me, so until this device integrates into that, it will likely remain entirely a novelty ...like just for fun, i talk shit about jeff bezos to it. honestly, if i were jeff, i'd make the thing be a feedback device for real time public opinion analysis. on at least myself, and probably all the other public figures, just to map a graph of who is *actually* important.though, always gotta be careful with that dataset because once people catch on, they might manipulate you back.and the devil, is *always* in the details that you're missing, however small, dawg. ;)~ u/goderator200",0
5,"A music lovers dream.
  
",1.Jan.19,Yes,This is a steep improvement in sound from the last model design. We use it often in the kitchen and it feels like a closer cousin to more expensive surround sound speakers like Bose.The cloth options were also welcome on the speaker as they blend well now into a room.We plan to buy more for classical music and jazz as it is dynamic and full in presence. I wish I bought it sooner. Spend the extra money and ignore the prior model. This will far exceed your expectations and give you all those echo features you want.,0
3,"Printed directions not included.
  
",1.Jan.19,Yes,I will like being able to give voice commands if I ever get everything set up.  Not having a set of printed directions included makes it difficult for unknowledgable people to set up.  Going back and forth to the app not knowing what I_ looking forward is not a good thing.  Hopefully I will enjoy this when I get help.,1
1,"Alexa Doesn_ Like Me!
  
",1.Jan.19,Yes,"Read all the directions. Added app to my phone. Alexa would not listen to me. Did what she wanted, asked her to play CBC Radio, she played Maroon Five, not even close. Tried over and over again with no success. Wouldn_ even set a timer.",2
4,"Very good improvements
  
",2.Jan.19,Yes,"If you_e ever owned an echo before and weren_ impressed maybe it_ time to look at the third generation as I did.  As a speaker it shines as one of the best mini voice assistance out there,  don_ expect the type of sound you would get out of the bigger models but it_ a very good small speaker.  Amazons own long list of skills make it almost impossible to purchase something for the smart home that this little device can_ handle.  As for smart home the Echo Dot is the beginning and yes the little one can do everything the big ones can. Now for what it doesn_ do well it_ search engine for random questions isn_ google but that_ it,  The basics are handled well with the echo it_ the advanced  search where you may have a problem. Overall I_e purchased two and looking to purchase an additional two. Be prepared to enter the world of smart home with this device, bulbs, switches and the accessories to automate your home these items aren_ as expensive as you may think,  there will always be something you can buy and not break the bank. If you have a big home with multiple rooms you will need more than two, I could stay with experience maybe more. It has an intercom  feature that_ super convenient, it allows us to drop in on another room instead of having to scream through the house for your kids to come to eat. My family has adapted to it extremely fast and everyone in the family  seems to enjoy using it, it_ already became a part of our life. The only person who will be turning out the light in your house will soon be Alexa .  Four stars not five because of search engine.",1
5,"I loved it so much, I bought another one.
  
",2.Jan.19,Yes,"Just got one for Christmas from a family member. I liked it so much, I bought another one. I do like the Amazon Alexa app, though it still needs work compared to the Google Home app.I currently have a Note9, and it feels so much better to have a different voice assistant. I honestly like Amazon's Alexa voice a lot better than Google's (ik... a bit nitty gritty). Also, Google Assistant is just better on my phone than on a speaker. Since I have Google Assistant on my phone, it kind of felt pointless to have Google Assistant on a speaker, making me lean over to the EchoDot.I don't expect Google Services to run on Amazon Echo devices. It makes sense why. Though, idk for sure.I do like the way the EchoDot is designed a lot more than the Google Home Mini. Sure, they are almost identical, though it is nice to have the plastic contrast on top of the device. Also, it has additional buttons on top to make its use a lot more convenient at times.The light ring around the EchoDot is its most compelling feature against the Google Home Mini, in my opinion. To me, it a much better look. It can also display notifications more vibrantly, and display its current volume more accurately (obviously not in numerical values), which I do like.The EchoDot is an amazing product. Definitely recommend it for people who want to get into the smart assistant or smart home trend, especially if they are on a budget.If you value entertainment more, then I would suggest you look into the Google Home Mini. The fact that it can scream YouTube is a big bonus.",0
5,"Even better than the 2nd Gen Echo Dot
  
",2.Jan.19,Yes,"I got the Echo Dot 2nd Gen and Google Home Mini for Christmas 2017 and liked things about both of them.  My biggest gripe with the Echo Dot 2G was that the sound quality wasn't great.  The ED 3G sounds much better and looks great as well.  I think this is a big improvement over the 2G version and definitely beats out the Google Home Mini.  The most frustrating thing about the Google Home Mini for me was the voice recognition sensitivity seems very poor.  I often find myself having to yell at it to stop over it's own sound output.  Echo Dot is not like that.  It seems much better at hearing me through it's own sound output.Pros:Good responsiveness to voice commands, even in a room with noiseLooks much better than the 2nd Gen.Great sound quality - definitely better than Dot 2G or Google Home Mini.Cons:Not uncommon for Alexa to randomly start talking when I never said anything to her while the TV is on.Search engine for questions simply isn't as smart as the Google Home Mini.",0
4,"Speaker blew in two weeks
  
",2.Jan.19,Yes,"(Edit: Amazon contacted me and stated they service all their products whether gifts or not. They replaced my Dot quite promptly. I will update again after using the replacement.)I received a new Echo Dot for Christmas this year and let's just say I fell in love!  However, two weeks after starting to use my Dot, the speaker is already blown (and at first I was originally impressed with the sound quality). And I haven't used it with the volume up loud or anything. Light music use and a few commands. I'm really disappointed because I love all the uses for Alexa. And I can't return it for a replacement since it was a gift. Bummer.",1
3,"Ultimately not much of an improvement
  
",2.Jan.19,Yes,"I own all 3 generations of the Echo Dot. I found the 3rd gen to be a significant upgrade from the 2nd gen, but I ultimately prefer the 1st gen.Much of the functionality remains the same, so I will only go over the main differences that I noticed.The new design is pleasing, and it fits well being out in the open in a room rather than tucked into a corner.The sound quality of the speakers for the 3rd gen are a vast improvement from the 2nd gen, but still leaves a lot to be desired. The bass is powerful, but very muddy. I had to turn the bass way down in order to even understand Alexa when she talks. The 1st gen was a fairly balanced speaker, and I never had any trouble with the sound filling the room.The microphones on the 3rd gen seem to be inferior to the 1st gen; if not the hardware, then its utilization. The 1st gen could hear me at a normal speaking volume from across the room. I feel like I have to yell directly at the 3rd gen for it to hear me. I've had to repeat commands many times with the 3rd gen, whereas I don't even recall the last time I had to do that for the 1st gen.",0
5,"Gets better and better
  
",2.Jan.19,Yes,"I had the first generation echo dot and loved it but had to connect it to another Bluetooth speaker for better sound quality. My 14 year old son kept taking it to his room so I got myself the echo in Black Friday and got two dots for my kids. My son (14) and my daughter (9) each got a dot for Christmas and it was and still is their favorite gift. They are easy to set up, very stylish, great sound, and hours of fun. I love the drop in feature, love that I could get a family Spotify account so each of us can listen to whatever we want and have our own playlists, and love that Alexa keeps the kids entertained. My kids have renamed their Alexa_ so they don_ interrupt each other while talking to it. My daughter even listens to music at night and I can just yell down the hall for it to stop playing when my daughter is asleep! I_ very much a fan of Alexa but I do mute the Alexa in our rooms and living room at night because she will randomly say _ didn_ hear that or other weird things. Since muting, I haven_ had any issues.",0
5,"Kids are Obsessed
  
",2.Jan.19,Yes,"My kids (ages 5-18) are obsessed with the Alexa dot, always asking her random questions and getting her to play music. I use it mostly for timers, reminders and FREE music.  I have purchased four already; one in my kitchen, master bedroom, and two of my kid's bedrooms.  My 5-year old was upset she did not get one for Christmas.  It was very easy to setup.WARNING:Just a warning to go into your app and turn off voiced enabled purchasing because I did not realize that was even a thing until I realized I had been charged for months $4.99 per month for music.  Once I got that fixed I have had no issues",0
5,"Love it but I_ sad about the new power supply
  
",2.Jan.19,Yes,"For all previous echo dots, the power supply was an AC to USB adapter, and a female USB to male mini USB cable. This was a nice feature because even when the Echo Dot is obsolete, the adapter and cable will still be useful. Unfortunately on this new model, the AC to DC adapter and cable are one unit and the cable is a round connector rather than USB. Thus, it is unlikely it can be reused. This is a loss because they will produce millions of these, and the world already has too much e-waste.Otherwise a nice little thing, but I disagree with this new design.",0
1,"Disappointing
  
",2.Jan.19,Yes,"After getting an Echo Plus for Christmas, we thought we would add purchase Echo Dots in the bedroom and in basement. We love our Echo Plus and have a light bridge and set up Philips Hue lights in groups according to room. When we set up the dots they worked for a few minutes then refused to see the light groups. I called Amazon to help figure out what is wrong and did a factory re-set on the dot device, which helped see the lights for about 15 minutes and then stopped seeing the light groups again. I am done. No one has time for that. It's supposed to be fun and helpful, not annoying and time consuming! The dots are going back to the store today.",1
1,"Sound died after 8 months Amazon will not stand by their replacement warranty of a year
  
",2.Jan.19,Yes,"Although my account says it is available for a replacement of up to 1 year after purchase, I spent 3 days with their ""customer service"" only to find the actual warranty is for 90 days and the ""replacement warranty"" is not for my device (which is still listed as active under my account). They offered me a trade in and 25% off another device. When I went to the link, my device is not offered as a trade in either, and they asked if I wanted a 15% discount instead. I will not buy another amazon echo. If it breaks after 90 days, you are out of luck. Do not waste your money",0
5,"Can't wait to see what else this can do!
  
",2.Jan.19,Yes,"This thing is amazing.  Like so much technology, I'm not sure how we got along without it before.  It makes adding things to lists while you are otherwise occupied a cinch (like when you fixing something or washing dishes) since you don't have to stop what you're doing to write it down before you forget.  Also, my wife and I are able to communicate with one another (as well as our kids) when we are not in the same room or even in the house.  Out seven-year-old was able to contact us on our phones just using voice commands.  The music on demand is also a great feature and the sound quality of the speaker is absolutely amazing.  It was well worth the cost.",0
4,"Gets better all the time
  
",2.Jan.19,Yes,"Was expecting better sound. It is louder but voices at volume 7 thru 10 over-drive the speaker and it is hard to understand what is said. The volume under that is fine. It does ""hear"" commands better than the first 2 versions even at higher volumes. I usually change the ""wake"" word because TV folks use the Alexa word in all their ads which starts the blue light flashing and sometimes it does what the TV ad talks about. Amazon needs to allow the user to create their own wake work. I would use Shumerlovestrump. LoL",0
5,"Great deal for Home Ai
  
",2.Jan.19,Yes,"The sale Amazon had on its Echos and Echo Dots made it almond impossible not to pick a couple out to try for myself.Once one is installed and hooked up, the others are just plug and play.  The Amazon Echo and the Google counterpart pretty much do the exact same things, at the exact same speed.  The only difference is the Amazon integration.So find out which one is cheaper and give it a shot.  I promise you you'll like having the help once you start using the features Home Ai offers.",0
5,"Love the 3rd generation
  
",2.Jan.19,Yes,"Having used several Gen 2 Echo Dots over the past couple of years, I was looking forward to the new Gen 3.  I wasn't disappointed, especially given the mere $5 difference between the two (special holiday pricing).  Not only does the speaker sound better, but there are a few new whistles and bells available through the Alexa app that I find useful.  The new speaker still doesn't provide ""amazing"" sound by any stretch, so don't be fooled into thinking this will provide pounding bass or tinkling highs.",0
5,"Received as a Christmas gift
  
",2.Jan.19,Yes,"My parents got us the Echo Dot as a Christmas gift, and to be honest, was a little underwhelmed when I opened it. I've seen the commercials and always thought it was a bit ridiculous and useless, and that I would never pay for it because I just didn't see it as something I wanted. Well it's been over a week now and I absolutely adore this thing! It's so useful and fun, it was a big hit at our New Year's Eve get together by playing different games on it. The kids love it and it has proven to be educational as well, right now it's helping them learn their spelling lists. What I once thought of as kind of dumb and useless has turned into an invaluable tool!",0
4,"Good speaker, does what it's supposed to do.
  
",3.Jan.19,Yes,"I have 3rd gen Echo Dots.  I was bit worried about loudness and clarity of the speaker sound based on some of the reviews, but I'm very pleased with the sound. It can get very loud and the sound quality is very good too. Of course if you are comparing to some fancy expensive speaker, it probably can't compete, but I think it's good for most average listeners.I took a star out because I bought two of these, set them under same Amazon account, and I can only have one of them to access Amazon Music at a time. (i.e. I cannot have both of my Echo Dots to play music from Amazon Music at the same time). So I had to create another account for the 2nd Echo Dot. Perhaps if I subscribe to the family level, it might let me, but not with this standard unlimited trial plan that Amazon offered.Other than that, I have couple of smart plugs controlled by the Echo Dot and it does well and the scheduled routine is very useful. I think you just have to find the right Alexa skill that is useful for your need. I found combination of MyPodApp and Google drive to be very useful for playlists of MP3s.",1
4,"Love this gadget!
  
",3.Jan.19,Yes,"I have an echo dot gen 3 in my 3rd flr bedroom, a (FB) portal in my 2nd flr living room, and a second echo dot gen 3 in my 1st flr guest room... all connected to Alexa.Likes: so many! (I_e only had my dots for a few weeks, so I_ still discovering things.)- Blends seamlessly into my black furniture- The ability to set reminders/alarms, and to create shopping/to-do lists- The sleep/ambient sounds (Brown noise is my favorite!)- The ability to get weather reports, news, my daily schedule, etc.- The option to go into DND/do-not-listen modes- It can connect to my Lexus (although I haven_ set it up yet)- Bought an electrical outlet accessory &amp; was able to set up timers for my x-mas lights- LOVE the Drop-in feature. It_ like having an intercom throughout my house.- Notifications: really liked being alerted to my Amazon package deliveries+ more...Dislikes:- Four times now I_e had to repeat myself multiple times when turning on &amp; off the ambient sounds. It registers that it hears the command, but nothing plays. Or, it refers to the ambient sounds menu instead of turning off the sound playing.- On the 3rd flr it has lost connection twice to my WiFi on the 3rd floor (likely due to the WiFi signal strength). I had to reset the connection in the Alexa app each time, which was annoying.- I wish the volume was louder when playing music from my iPhone. I tried it once and ended up just connecting to my sound bar instead. It_ still decent quality sound and apparently improved from previous versions from the reviews that I_e read.Side note: The first time that an Alexa commercial comes on and they activate, it_ pretty hilarious. It also activates when similar words pop up in the background, but I just tell it to shut off. (Has only happened a few times.)Overall, I love the functionality and wish I_ purchased sooner.",0
5,"Must buy.
  
",3.Jan.19,Yes,"These speakers are amazing.Google v Alexa:Being an owner of both a google home and an Amazon Alexa I can tell you for a fact the sound quality on this Alexa is better. The Alexa picks up my voice better as well. I whisper it_ name and it picks it up, it can get almost annoying discussing the machines with friends in a different and all of a sudden I will hear _orry I didn_ catch that.I use this every single day. Mostly for setting timers, playing music while I cook or clean, or I will ask for the weather, it really doesn_ matter I do so much on it including playing games.The capabilities on this speaker are endless and there are always new updates and upgrades.",1
5,"Great Device
  
",3.Jan.19,Yes,"Love the 3rd generation echo dot! I have purchased 3 of them now because they were on sale and I connected them to a multiroom speaker group. I have also enabled skills to control the lights in my house, and my alarm system and garage. I even setup an action that turned on my Christmas tree and other interior Christmas lights and started playing Christmas music on my multiroom speaker group. They are affordable and the sound although not as good as the larger echo devices is 10x better than the echo dot 2nd generation. I know reviews say that you are better with the 2nd gen because it is cheaper and then you can buy speaker accessories that make the audio better and make it portable. The portability will come, these devices look really nice as they are and I_ sure the designer cases and wall mounts will come anyway. I don_ see a need for all the extras with this device though. Portability might be the only nice thing to be able to have. If you want to mount it to the wall get some 3M double back foam tape and stick it to the wall.",0
5,"Siri might be jealous but Alexa has won our hearts.
  
",3.Jan.19,Yes,"Oh my! We are in love with Alexa! We bought one for the kitchen, one for my daughters room and one for my sons room. I have a morning routine setup with weather, NPR news and Beautiful Day by U2. I also set up Alexa to respond to me when I say things like _ need to walk. She is my own personal motivation trainer. I can announce to the kids to hurry up without yelling up the stairs. I can listen to radio stations in Norway or London... we just adore her. Did I mention she keeps track of my shopping list and can order my almond milk as well? I always wanted a personal assistant.",0
4,"I love access to everything without using phone/computer
  
",3.Jan.19,Yes,I mainly use to play games with daughter and listen to music although the bass sounds boomy and full something about it is not right. Her voice sounds great with the standard settings but I find certain songs clip even at low volumes (for example Metallica's ...And Justice for All-notorious for not even having bass) although most anything sounds pretty good through it anyway. There are EQ settings too. Im not going to complain about a $30 device that does tons of stuff. Favorite feature so far is having Alexa play rain noise so I can fall asleep. I sleep like a baby.,0

",3.Jan.19,Yes,"Last christmas I was given an ECHO... it's excellent,  this year I was given a DOT... I don't like it at all... the sound is really bad but then what can you expect for $30.00... frankly, I don't Amazon should market this product, it sucks",2

I now have a Alexa show in the kitchen, a Echo Dot in the bedroom, basement and garage for when i am working out there. The speech recognition is about 99.9 percent or better.

",3.Jan.19,Yes,"Already have an Echo, so didn't really need the Echo Dot.However, when Amazon had it on sale, figured what the heck.Placed it in our bedroom.Easy set-up.Pretty decent sound for such a small piece. Not great, but better than I anticipated.Sits far from my router, and lost the signal once.Firestick in same room has never lost the signal, so will need to see if thiswill be a recurring issue.Otherwise, pretty happy with my purchase.",0
5,"Nice addition to my Alexa enabled devices
  
",3.Jan.19,Yes,Last year we got two echoes and have loved them.  This year I wanted an additional device for our computer/media/work room but since it is a smaller room did not think I needed another echo.  I saw good reviews on the 3rd Gen of the Echo Dot and ordered this one.I love it.  Enough sound to fill this small room and allows me to listen to Daily Music and News briefings at my work desk.Highly recommend for smaller rooms.,0
2,"Alexa, THE Amazon salesclerk at your side
  
",4.Jan.19,Yes,"First, I honestly purchased echo dots hoping the devices would work in my vehicles.  And even when you link through your phone as a hotspot, it has intermittent connectivity in my area.  It takes s but to set up &amp; then can be lost easily.  So now I am on a list for the Amazon car device that seems to overcome the obstacles the dot has.  (This could take years.). I look forward to read that text &amp; reply to take text.  Ford Sync support is very short lived.Amazon in the home:  If I play music that is supposedly a part of Prime, Alexa asks me to enable ordering &amp; subscribe to music unlimited.  If I play any game other than Jeopardy, Alexa asks me to unlock the rest of the game or categories.  This appears to be a by game charge &amp; not an unlock all games.  If I inquire about a book, it wants to sell Kindle Unlimited or an Audible book.  So it constantly trying to sell me addition purchases in spite of both being subscribed to Prime &amp; Audible.  WiFi calling is the one use currently since I don_ have smart plugs &amp; bulbs.  I would not invite a Walmart or Target salesperson in my home so basically, the dot is unplugged &amp; in a drawer.",2
1,"New amazon generations do not work in my house
  
",4.Jan.19,Yes,"I have the craziest thing is happening in my house I can't use the 3rd gen dot or the new 4k stick. They both reboot and never get to the setup.  Im using the supplied power adapters. I've even gone to the extent of shutting off the main breaker to my house and using a battery backup still doesn't get to the orange setup. If I put the 3rd gen dot in my car and leave my house a couple blocks away it will finally boot to the orange setup. I must have a radio signal interference near my house that's causing the new Amazon devices to freak out and not boot. I currently have 3 fire tv cubes, a fire tv pendant, 3 2nd gen echos and 3 2nd echo dots. Those all work fine so its really hard to understand why the new amazon generations are failing.",2
5,"Good improvements over Gen 2! Got rid of the verbal replies!!!
  
",4.Jan.19,Yes,I_ certainly say this was worth it.  I took advantage of the sales this year and was able to on 2 occasions buy one on the monthly pricing and discounted to 29.99 I did that last year for the gen 2.The design looks better although I_ not sure how well it will hold up in the kitchen because of the cloth.  But that may be on purpose in a way.Bottom line it works better and doesn_ respond with voice to commands that went through correctly.  Only if something is wrong.Might be a feature available on the gen 2 but at the time this arrived and replaced my gen 2 the gen 2 was still responding to everything with its loud voice!  Thinking of loud if you whisper to it even if it doesn_ understand it speaker quieter!,1
2,"There_ a reason why they lowered the price - Alexa is being smothered
  
",4.Jan.19,Yes,"In my house, I have an original Echo Show, a generation 1 Echo Dot, an original Echo, an Echo Spot, an Echo Input, and my most recent acquisition - a third generation Echo Dot. You might say that I collect these things. I bought the new Dot because I really liked how it looked. It was my intention to it replace the first generation Dot, but I changed my mind on that very quickly. When Alexa speaks, she sounds super muffled. It sounds like she_ wrapped in a blanket. I_e only played a few songs and they don_ sound terrible, but I find that I have to turn the volume way up to hear her, and if I forget to turn it down again, whatever I play is way too loud. My conversations with her have gone like this:Me: Alexa - Set volume to six. Alexa, what is the weather?Alexa: The weather in blah blah is blah blah blah blah. (Loud, but muffled).Me: Alexa, set volume to three. Alexa, play blah blah by the blah blah blahsWithout the first and third step, it_ completely unusable.It is also one of the most deaf of my Echo devices. It_ not as bad as my Show (really hate that thing), but it_ close.I wonder if the muffled sound can be worked out with an update. Music doesn_ sound bad, you_ think that they could make Alexa clear.I am going to put my Dot first generation back and buy a little owl holder for it. This thing is going back.",0
5,"Kinda cool device.
  
",4.Jan.19,Yes,"Arrived on time and well packagedThis device is kinda cool. I love to listen to music when I cook or clean and I don_ like having my phone on speaker, earbuds or pull out the portable speaker. Once you_e setup your device you_l love it. The first one I purchased had issue with pandora so I sent it back. Now I have three and you can make announcements to other rooms that have an echo.  If you have more than one and once you create groups you can play music in an individual room or multiple rooms with the same music. You can command echos from other echo locations within your home. For example if you forgot to turn Alexa off in the kitchen you can send a command from your master room or wherever you have one to turn off Alexa in the kitchen.I_e never been into the whole echo and google assistant but I quickly became I fan of the echo dot and purchased 2 of the dots and 1 of the bigger ones in less than 3 wks.  The Alexa jokes are pretty lame but that doesn_ take away from the rating.",0
4,"From Echo 1 to 2 to 3rd gen
  
",4.Jan.19,Yes,"My Echo Dots are connected via an AUX cable to external speakers. That works very well and couldn't be happier.This 3rd Gen echo is a good upgrade in that it picks up your voice better, but there are some design flaws compared to the 1st and 2nd gen.-The top and sides are curved, so you cannot see the light ring around the Echo clearly. My Echo sits at chest level on top of a piano, so if I'm sitting or standing and I activate the Echo, it's not quite as clear that it has been activated.-The charger is not a common micro USB like previous versions. If the charger breaks, you'll need to purchase a new one. Also, my external speakers have a USB output that can be used for charging but I can no longer use that with the new Echo, I have to power it through the included adapter.",0
5,"Wishing everything used artificial intelligence now, lol
  
",4.Jan.19,Yes,"I bought 3 Dots to use in the kitchen and my 2 daughters rooms. They have become our music speakers, alarm clocks, PA conference system, personal assistant, nagging reminder person(lol), dinner bell, scheduler, personal secretary and I am sure there are more things I have yet to think to ask Alexa to do. I love the _nnouncement  and _rop in features- this makes living in a multi level home so much easier. No more screaming loud enough for my neighbors to hear, just trying to communicate with someone downstairs.I also like being able to use these features from the app on my phone while I am away from home. My girls are constantly on their phones, so even if the phone dies, or it takes a little while to see my text, I have another option for communicating with them. I also love being able to announce that I am almost home and need help with the groceries ;)after I_e done all the shopping, they can do a little heavy lifting too...These Dots can be very addictive;) Shortly after using my Dots, I almost told Alexa to vacuum the floor, but I realized she couldn_ do that... maybe Amazon will create Rosie the Robot soon :)And...

We ask for weather updates, and create shopping lists, and even look up information from time to time.  We are still learning how to use it, the verbal commands, the limitations, but we are really enjoying it and are looking into probably getting one more for our room.  One interesting capability is being able to tap into one of the Dots at the house and being able to speak through the Dot to chat with my wife.  You can do this through the app on your phone.",0

",4.Jan.19,Yes,"I_ am super excited that I purchased this Alexa! I couldn_ have made a better decision. Me and my family are obsessed with this Alexa. The device is perfect size, we purchased the black with gray charcoal coloring. The Alexa was super super easy to set up took maybe a couple of minutes tops. The speaker is super loud too which is amazing. It_ easy to use of course, you can play music which is good in our household and the best part it tells stories for the kids which I think is super fun for the whole family!

",4.Jan.19,Yes,"Add a little fabric and a curve to the top and you have the 3rd gen Dot!  it looks great, as I have it sitting on my end table, the sound is a little better, it is good for the everyday things you use your Dot for, skills, smart home, keeping shopping list, and weather updates  but I still prefer to use a Bluetooth speaker system when listening to music.( I like it loud).I took advantage of the trade-in feature on my 2nd generation Dot, it was a smooth transaction and saved me a few dollars, and I didn't need to have another electronic sitting in a closet after only using it for a year!",0
3,"i like it, but it's bit deaf
  
",4.Jan.19,Yes,"she's kinda hard of hearing i have to shout in monotone while annunciating every word crystal clear or she cant understand which is annoying but she's good at finding playlists the games are fun i like asking her questions, i don't have her set up to turn lights off or anything like that it's not the best speaker but supposedly you can hook her up to better speakers, thinking of getting firestick but will she understand the show i want to watch? i like the grey with the black and the blue light it's cute i like using the timer when my hands are full",0

",4.Jan.19,Yes,"The speaker volume may be better than the previous version but still sucks.

Speakers are awesome on their own. Gen 2 would make me cringe, but the Gen 3 is fine for me all by itself. Now, I still use my expensive speaker with Gen 3, but only for music and transporting it from room to room. Otherwise, the Gen 3 Alexa Dot is perfect for me to listen to my Audible Books (which is about 95% of what I use her for).",0

Kids have stopped using our living google and just use alexa for all their commands and music instead. I still love my google though for things alexa can't do regarding non amazon related stuff.",0
5,"Best sounding of the three generations of Dot
  
",5.Jan.19,Yes,"While I'm not in love with the fabric cover, it did seem to be a popular addon for prior generation Dots, so what do I know?Aside from the better mono talking sound in the device itself, it seems to me that the audio output of this new Dot is fuller (EQd differently) and has better low end extension and much smoother highs. AMZ don't publish schematics, but it sounds like a very different op-amp is being used on the output that delivers wider bandwidth and current. The much bigger power supply would back that up.I'll say that Gen2 had the worst capture and hold of wifi. It overheated a lot, too, and lost connection regularly, even 15' from a high-power wifi router. That is solved here. I have only lost audio when my cable modem is resetting, which is unavoidable.Otherwise, it seems to work, even with fewer mics. It works like the Gen2 does for controls and is the perfect companion to AMZ Unlimited Music. I listen to Broadcastify and other radio aggregator sources and find that they often sound better than the actual broadcast signal if there is a broadband feed.I wish that a single interface on my desktop could be used to control everything fully, including programming the excellent Recast and the Alexa devices, like this Dot. You have to go back and forth between a web app and a standalone app to do things, and you cannot program devices from your desktop.Other than that, this is the best of the Dots and seems to be on eternal sale-price at dirt cheap, so it's a bargain!",0
5,"If Bass Matters, Worth the Extra Cost Over a 2g
  
",5.Jan.19,Yes,"The 2g Dot has about a million (sarcasm) microphones across the top whereas the 3g has 4. They both work just as well.Sound quality when listening to music and phone calls , on this one is noticeably better but as I wrote prior the outgoing sound and recognition are virtually the sameIt is notably heavier and taller than the 2g but still isn't heavy and tucks away from view readilyUsing smart home, skills, daily flash briefs, etc is the same across the 2 different Dots and the big brother EchoMy only gripe with the 3g Dot is the lack of sleeves available. I don't want a decal for my Dot. I like the true sleeves of the 2g Dot and Echo for changing things up instead.I got this one as a 3rd Echo device over another 2g because it was on sale for the same as the regular price of the 2g.Any of the Echo devices are fun to own and use and you won't go wrong but the sound quality of the 3g is well worth the price difference to me, even at regular price. It's almost as good as my Echo.",0
5,"Amazing for the price!
  
",5.Jan.19,Yes,"I was really stuck between this and the Google Home Mini, but I am glad I chose to go with the Amazon Echo! First of all Google is a incredibly shady company imo gathering all the data of your personal life. My house is now filled with Echo Dots and what I love about it the most is that the audio quality is outstanding for the size and price. It is very funny how years ago bluetooth speakers of this size would cost more the $50 with mediocre sound quality. While at the time of purchase, the Echo dot is half the price and offers far more features than bluetooth speakers. It is incredible to witness how innovation can drive the price down for consumers. As for Alexa, 'she' is a great home companion since she answers about 85% of what I ask, mind you the other 15% of the questions are more difficult to answer as of today's technology. I really dig the white and the charcoal colors. they are just really cool.",0
3,"Required for stereo sound, too loud?
  
",5.Jan.19,Yes,"Got two so I could set them up as a stereo pair. That works but I later got stereo wireless Bluetooth speakers for a lot cheaper that did the same. Compared to the 2nd generation echo dot, these are possibly 3 times louder. The problem is that level one is still too loud when you want to have discreet background music to fall asleep to. I tried setting the sound level to 0.3, and 0.5 but anything but 0 itself sounded as loud as 1. Being louder so much is probably great for parties but generally, I have to set them at 4 so that Alexa doesn't shout back at me her OK. The solution is not to make them quieter, but to have fractions for setting the sound. Also, it would be nice if, for example, at night you whispered, ""Alexa stop playing the music"", that it would whisper back OK, instead of shouting it and waking the kids you were trying to put to sleep.",0
4,"Not Portable-stuck to needing an A/C plugin. Everything else is amazing!
  
",5.Jan.19,Yes,"If we had only met sooner!!! Love Alexa and the ease she has brought to our lives. She answers pretty much any question we ask. She tells jokes. The Echo Dot speaker sound quality is great for its small size. Any recipe I ask for Alexa gives it to me, same with calculated measurements and changing liters to quarts, etc.Only downfall that it has, and is why it didn_ get 5 Stars, is this convenient little pod of information is NOT portable and I cannot even attach it to a battery pack because there isn_ one for the 3rd Gen Echo Dot!! This is frustrating when the greater part of my time at home is spent OUTSIDE the house and around the yard. So AMAZON ......get this 3rd Gen a portable battery!! Please :-)",0
5,"Alexa is great!
  
",5.Jan.19,Yes,"Wonderful! We love our Alexa_! I bought two with the Christmas special. You can do so much with her. I have had her read audio books off Hoopla for me, play music, games, tell jokes, read the Bible and it is also fun to just ask her random questions! The only thing I cannot figure out is speaker pairing... I paired both Alexa_ but was considering unpairing and can_ find it.  I did discover that she only plays music on both, but games, audio books, alarms, etc seem to go through the one you start it on. So maybe the pairing is not so bad. I was just afraid of it bothering someone else if I wanted to do my own thing in the other room or is a random alarm went off.",0
3,"Underwhelming
  
",5.Jan.19,Yes,"I thought there would be more with this, there isn't. I like that I can make calls, it sucks I can't receive them unless that other person has an Echo.Second issue is the volume and speakers. You can turn all of it up or all of it down. There are not separate settings for Alexa's voice and Music/media. Music ends up at a good volume, when I stop that, Alexa is too loud or vice versa. Speakers are muffled, seems to be getting worse. She doesn't respond unless I'm within about 5 feet without yelling.It's really not all that useful.",0
5,"Awesome prodcut for the price
  
",5.Jan.19,Yes,"I was pleasantly surprised by just how much this little guy\girl can do. I have never had any issues with this device recognizing my questions its always accurate and knows exactly what I am asking it. The one issue I have with it is unless you are a techy person you may never use it to its full potential because you may never really pick up on just how the ""Skills"" as Amazon calls them work. Basically you have to download an Alexa app on your phone and then setup the device but from there you have to download skills to really take advantage of this device, an example would be I downloaded a Fios Skill so that I am able to control my cable box with commands such as ""Alexa watch AMC on Fios"" The problem is setting up the skills for this to work I had to enable the Fios TV skill then I had to choose what cable box this device was going to control, well if you never named your cable boxes by the rooms they are in then you have to figure out the name the cable company gave your cable box. Anyways like I said once you get everything figured out its great. I have it tied to my calendar in Outlook, my cable box, my Fire TV, I use it to play music from Amazon ""Apple Music is coming to this device soon"" I ask it what my commute to work is like, what's the Weather today. As far as the Sound quality goes, this small device is perfect for a bedroom or office if you want good sound in a bigger room buy the ECHO or ECHO Plus its that simple.",0
4,"Looks great compared to previous generations!
  
",5.Jan.19,Yes,"Quite the unique little dot. It's appearance has greatly improved over previous generations. It's more eye appealing and fits the room a little better. Doesn't look as much as a hockey puck like the past generation did. Nice smooth curves wrapped in a cloth exterior. The speaker quality has improved as well - although it's still nothing to brag about. But it does have an external aux output, so that can be solved with an external speaker setup. It's a pretty cool little device. Definitely worth the buy!",0
5,"Great improvement on the Dot!
  
",5.Jan.19,Yes,"I have all 3 Dot generations, the Spot, and of course the original echo. This (as it should be) is the best sounding Dot yet. It doesn't quite match the rich sound of the echo, but it has very good sound given its size. It is perfect for its design and I can imagine when paired up with a 2nd and sub it would sound like the original Lifestyle Bose system. Great job.",1
5,"Obsessed!
  
",5.Jan.19,Yes,"2nd 3rd generation echo. Obsessed. You can link all your Alexa_ to play music around the house. You can teach your Echo lots of skills via the app, and you can even customize and make your own skills. Before I owned the Echo I didn_ even really know what it was or if I would use or like it, after 2 months I now have an alexa in all major spots in my house. My son uses it to control his Bluetooth lights as well as turn on and off his tv. Obsessed.",0
5,"I_ obsessed. I want Alexa in every room!
  
",5.Jan.19,Yes,"I love the sound. I got it with one plug for my bedroom lamp. I use it to check the weather when I wake, as an alarm, to listen to nature sounds to fall asleep, I loved it so much I bought one for the kitchen! I replaced my bulky Bose, too. I love that Alexa will pick different _op stations from Amazon music and I can also ask her to play music from Pandora!  (PS. I_ 58 and divorced w no children. This is all for me).",0
5,"Strongly recommended
  
",6.Jan.19,Yes,"I've personally tried many of these type of devices and honestly this has to be the best I've ever tried.These are some of the best aspects of this productVoice Recognition- this product works great in this area it picks up my voice great everytime.(especially since my voice is so very low in octaves that most devices and people cant understand a lot of what I say) so if your like me this will be great for youA.I. or Artificial intelligence- the A.I. that comes with this product known as Alexa is stupendous it works great everytime. It is simple and easy to use and understand. I know everyone will agree with me.Affordability/worth- This device is very affordable especially since it gives on sale all the time. They give you so much in such a little package, there are so many features for you to discover and play with and  can connect to so many different products. If your someone who is just wanting to get Into smart home products I would strongly recommend this to you.Now is this for you? This is probably a question you asked yourself when looking to buy one of these. Well let me ask you a few questions. Are you new to smart home tech? If so than yes. Are you wanting a way to make your life a little bit easier? Than if so yes. Are you wanting to access information faster and easier? If so than yes. If you answered yes to any of those questions than this is for you. It's a great way for someone on a budget to get started.My overall consensus- I give this product a 5/5 because of it's affordability and it's overall quality as a product. I strongly recommend it",0
4,"Great product but Alexa has a lot to learn!
  
",6.Jan.19,Yes,"I was slightly expecting Alexa to favor Siri, when it comes to asking questions and what-not. She does not search the internet generally when asking her a question. She just says ""Sorry, I am not sure about that"" to most questions. She is helpful for timers, playing music, doing conversions, letting you know the weather, telling you the score on a game, and a little more. I liked Siri because you could ask her silly questions and she would give you silly responses back. We struggle getting her to turn on/off our fire TV (firestick) and starting and stopping a TV (such as asking the command to play How I Met Your Mother on Hulu. She just either opens Hulu or searches the whole firestick for options to play the show. I am excited to try the smart home features that she has though (such as connecting to the smart bulbs or using Nest thermostat). The thing I really enjoy (especially since my hubby is tech savvy) is the Blueprints feature where you can teach her your own tricks!",0
3,"Not as smart as they make it out to be...
  
",6.Jan.19,Yes,"I have Alexa units in my house and, although it was the shiny new object for awhile, I've grown annoyed and disappointed in what it can - and can't - do. One, Alexa is not ""home smart"".  She may be able to recite facts accurately (""Alexa, what is today's weather forecast"" works well) but ask he to turn off the light and she will stumble because you have to tell her exactly WHICH light to turn off.  Alexa isn't smart enough to recognize you are in a specific room and want the light in that room turned off - you must name each ""device"" attached to Alexa and use that ""name"" in your commands (ie., ""Alexa, turn off the master bedroom lamp"" - even when I'm standing in the master bedroom.  This becomes annoying and means ever person in house has to adapt to the machine, instead of the machine adapting to the humans.  Amazon's developers have it all wrong and need to rethink their approach to home automation...",0
3,"Incompatible power and software ignorance makes the 3rd gen a poor 2nd.
  
",6.Jan.19,Yes,"I was so looking forward to this 3rd gen. I was so disappointed. The first and most obvious issue is the power supply. As mentioned in previous reviews the power supply is not compatible with 1st and 2nd gen. I was hoping to just swap out old for new. Not going to happen.Second big issue - for some reason these guys join the club but they don't want to be a member. I can tell gen 1 Alexa turn on the light - no problem. Swap that out for 2nd gen - no problem. 2nd gen turns out the light turns on the light. works every time. 3rd gen is the proverbial dumb and happy. no idea what's going on. Completely Clueless. Cant fund any thing. Maybe there's an issue that I don't know about. But it looks like I will kave to re-educate mr. 3rd gen. Or get a 2nd gen, which is probably a better option.definitely a deal-breaker for me - I gave them away for X-mas ... :-(",0
1,"Not satisfied
  
",6.Jan.19,Yes,"Overall the product works fine, with the following exceptions.  1) which bulbs can I add?  You would think that this would be easy to answer but it isn't.  Sengled makes a number of bulbs that do NOT work with the hub.  It is difficult to determine which bulbs can be added to the system.  2) I can turn on/off lights at sunset/sunrise.  I think that this is mostly an Alexa problem, but really.  Of course I want to be able to turn on lights 15 minutes after sunset or off at 20 minutes before sunrise.  But I cannot.  Amazon doesn't care what I want, but if Sengled told Amazon to fix the problem I suspect that they would listen.  3rd problem. you are better off getting a smart switch that a smart light bulb.  If someone turns of the light switch your smart bulb doesn't work",0
4,"Appears to be working ok - However, green light stays on a lot ???
  
",6.Jan.19,Yes,"This Alexa appears to be in working order.  However, the green light keeps coming on and staying on for long periods of time for no reason and then shuts off after awhile.  When asked what the green light means - it states ""You are on a call, or a call is coming in or drop in""  however, none of these is happening when the blinking green lite comes on and stays on???  The dot continues to work just fine with the light blinking however it is really annoying to see.  Anyone have any suggestions???",0
5,"Greatest $30 you_l ever spend
  
",7.Jan.19,Yes,"Where to even begin.... i bought two dots with a smart plug bundle deal going on for Cyber Monday and it_ been the best purchase I_e had since god knows when. I have one dot in my living room connected with a smart plug controlling my lamp and another dot in my bedroom, connected with a smart power strip controlling my heater, electric blanket, lamp, and pretty string lights. I_ able to tell Alexa to turn on/off all of these devices. I can even set routines like turn my heater on, electric blanket on, and lights off with one phrase. Like how cool is that??? Other than that I don_ use too many functions with Alexa other than some voice commands and having her tell the weather/set reminders/play relaxing music for me. There_ still so much more you can do with the dot but even with these few functions I use, I am more than happy with the price I paid. Also the speaker is great for the size of it and it can hear your commands from pretty far away",1
5,"The helper you didn't know you needed
  
",7.Jan.19,Yes,"This compact device sits, patiently awaiting your commands.  First, it is a Bluetooth speaker that sounds pretty good to me despite what some audiophiles say. It expands the sound of your phone or other computer device.  Paired with Amazon Music, it transforms the way you listen to music. It is no longer necessary to put your music on storage media, such as cassettes, CDs, hard drives or memory sticks. When you want to hear a particular song, album or multiple songs from an artist, just tell the Echo Dot through the Alexa software with commands like ""Alexa, play Thriller album"" or ""Alexa, play 20 Flight Rock by Eddie Cochran"".  To hear random songs from an artist, say ""Alexa, play The Eagles"" and the Echo Dot starts playing. Echo will also play a particular genre to match your mood with commands like ""Alexa, play smooth jazz"" or ""Alexa, play sleep music"".When combined with a smart device, such as a smart plug, it is easy to do things like turning on a lamp from across the room.The Echo Dot is a great way to explore the benefits of having a smart home.It is also very convenient to use instead of reaching for your phone or laptop computer to retrieve information instead of a search engine, weather app, calculator, conversion or many other things that pop into your mind. It's fun to just say ""Alexa, weather"", ""Alexa, how far is it to Las Vegas"", ""Alexa, what is the definition of anomaly"" or simply ""Alexa, define anomaly"".I have found that I use my Echo Dot a lot more than I thought I would.",0
3,"Better Sound - Bad Listener
  
",7.Jan.19,Yes,"When I completed the setup (connection to the internet), I played music from Pandora, WOW! what a difference from the generation 2 Echo Dot sound, which I had for well over a year. I was impressed.When it is at volume 5, on some songs/music it cannot hear me say the wake word, ""Alexa"". I have to literally be inches away from the Gen. 3 Echo Dot to make it respond. At volume 7 or higher, FORGET IT!!! It can't hear me yelling almost kissing the new Dot.Connecting this to an external Bluetooth/wired speaker, it listens and hears the wake word as long as the external speaker is a bit away from the dot, even at high volume (your millage may differ). This defeats the better sounding built in speaker if connected to an external one.Stick with the Gen 2 Echo Dot if you plan to use external speakers. I was going to return it though the price paid (discount + 5 mo payment option) I decided to keep it and not use it at high volume. Maybe I will give it as a gift.Njoy Life...qarawol",0
5,"Functional and Fun!
  
",7.Jan.19,Yes,"My husband and I had promised ourselves that we would not purchase any more gadgets and we kept that self-imposed promise until two weeks ago when I fell victim to the Echo Dot.  My daughter has three in her home and after seeing them in operation I had to make the purchase.  The set up was easy, the functionality was great.  I am amazed at how much information I can now get from Alexa.  I have the Fire TV and  Tablet so I was already a big Alexa fan.  The first day the Echo was set up, Hubby spent the entire day downloading apps and asking questions he thought Alexa would not be able to answer.  The next day, he asked me to order a second Dot for his man cave.  The Smart Plug is a great addition and we plan to eventually control all of our devices with some version of the Echo family.  Great product!",0
1,"Echo Dot and Firestick incompatible with music playback
  
",7.Jan.19,Yes,"I bought this device to play my  personal library of music thru Plex thru firestick but Echo Dot says it can not work with that device.  Amazon advertising claims music playback thru firestick.  Amazon tech support could not mate Echo Dot with Firestick even after an hour of trial and error.  The Echo Dot may be 5 star for many other uses but for my need it is a one.  Fortunately, Firestick remote works well using the command Alexa, ask Plex to play ""name of song"" on fire TV.  That allows playback of music Amazon does not have in its library.",1
3,"If you like what Alexa can do for you, these are GREAT!
  
",7.Jan.19,Yes,"I got them for about half price in the runup to Christmas - - but my wife's reaction was ""MEH!! I've been yelling upstairs that dinner is ready for over 50 years. Why should I change??""And, after a little thought, I realized that my iToys (including the latest Watch) and my SONOS systems can do almost all of what Alexa can do anyway. I particularly like controlling the volume of my SONOS speakers - and skipping obnoxious selections with a twist or tap on my wrist!! I can control my Sous Vide system, thermostats and garage doors from my phone - maybe even by talking to Siri - and there's an Alexa APP for my phone too - - so why do I need Dots??They're going back - not because there's anything ""wrong"" with them - - but becaue I can't manufacture a ""need"" for them.",0
3,"Ok product but not worth an upgrade
  
",7.Jan.19,Yes,"The dot sounds and look better than gen 2 BUTAlexa - less responsive. It_ not just the dot, on all echos, Alexa seems to be less responsive and doesn_ understand well. Amazon needs to update thisIt has a buzzing sound, and went through all trouble shooting by customer service but stilll a buzzing sound.Lastly, trying to troubleshoot and then return this dot was a headache. Amazon customer service has become so bad lately. They don_ care and have no accountability. If they don_ like the problem, they will disconnect. I ended up keeping the dot because customer service problems and then they sent me a refurb without a power cord. It was a mess.Worth an upgrade ? NO!!!, if you have a 2nd gen. Keep it. This is not worth an upgrade",0
4,"Slaying Dragons while cleaning the house , Alexa can do that !
  
",7.Jan.19,Yes,"Surprisingly good sound , this is my second dot , this looks better too. Alexa is pretty good at understanding my thick accent lol . Alexa provides entertainment , games, news, audiable, weather, just ask her Alexa what are your RPG skills and you be slaying dragons in no time in interactive stories such as Runescape and the magic door and tons of others. Or if you have kids , Alexa provides you with a story for bedtime and reads it too. Make up a morning or bed routine, like when you say Alexa good night she turns off your tv ( cheap Alexa enabled plugs) and turns on your 20 minutes guided meditation or just ocean or white noise. Ya, I like Alexa! And so far everything was free of charge!",0

When Amazon has the 3rd generation on sale if we buy 2, I purchase the white Echo.  One for our daughter's bedroom and one for the Master bedroom.  My daughter uses it to listen to Amazon music and set the ocean wave sound at night to help her sleep.  I use it to listen to local news and for weather or if I need information and don't necessarily want to grab my phone or power on the computer.  The sound quality is very good for a device not much larger than a hockey puck.",0
5,"Echo's Newest Raving Fan!
  
",7.Jan.19,Yes,"I resisted buying this as I just did not want yet another piece of tech in my home. Now I'm asking myself, 'what took me so long?'I love, love, love this gadget! She hears me from way across the room speaking in a low voice~Yayyyy! I am not a loud person and we live in a quiet house, so that's important to me. I had a free trial of Amazon Music with it, sooo fun!I'm going to order one for the upstairs rooms, too, and that speaks volumes.What are you waiting for?",0

",7.Jan.19,Yes,"I must admit, I was rather skeptical about getting a device with Alexa, but this Echo Dot is awesome! Not only does it look nice and have great sound quality, but it also is a lot of fun. My children enjoy asking it for knock-knock jokes, and other silly questions, and we all enjoy playing the word games Alexa has (especially the escape room game). On top of that, it looks nice too! My wife even uses it to check the weather forecast, and for recipes.",0
2,"Sound Is Terrible - 2nd Gen Was Better
  
",8.Jan.19,Yes,"I'm not sure what criteria people are using when they say the 3rd gen Echo Dot sounds better than the 2nd gen, but I have to disagree. The 2nd gen version may not have the greatest sound, but it's clear and reproduces the highs and midrange quite well. For the lows you wouldn't expect much since it's such a small speaker. Still, it's acceptable. The 3rd gen Echo Dot sounds completely muddy. Speach sounds like the speaker has a sock in their mouth, or a mouth full of food. Music, similarly, is completely lacking in the highs. The midrange is muddy as can be and the lows are not really any better than the 2nd gen Dot. I have two of the 2nd gen dots that I use in small rooms. I have a 3rd gen dot that I tried using on it's own but finally couldn't stand it any longer. I disconnected it until I can get a speaker to hook up to it. I'd even returned one of the 3rd gen Dots, thinking it had to be damaged or something. The replacement sounds exactly like the first - terrible. It's funny to read reviews on some of the tech websites. They all say the same thing, using almost the exact same words, to say that the 3rd gen Dot has much improved sound. It doesn't, and no amount of adjusting the equalization inside the app will do much to help. Maybe there are other things about it that are better. I don't know, I only use it for music, an occasional notification, checking the weather, and similar light duty. If you're going for the 3rd gen Dot for music, you'll want to attach a speaker to it - unless you really can't hear very well anyway.",0
5,"I love my Echo.
  
",8.Jan.19,Yes,"When needing wanting to relax ask Alexa to play gentle soothing Asian usic or sounds of ocean.

Fortunately my son was here. If he had not been I would have died alone with broken femur)  And so wanted Echo as backup.  I mention that because if you have an elderly person you worry about this would help.So, yes I love Echo/Alexa. Wasnt sure how I""d feel with it but very happy with purchase.",1
5,"Flawless Design
  
",8.Jan.19,Yes,"Number one: Its beautifully designed. It appears flawless in its seams and construction. It is heavy for its size and feels like true quality when you hold it. The bottom is rubberized so it doesnt slide easily. I purchased 3 and it was easy to pair them in multiple ways throughout the house. I wasnt sure if I would get any use out of these but I was intrigued enough to try. I am glad that I purchased these and get a lot of use out of them. It gives the house a next level feel.Also, Dont be an idiot like I was when first installing these. I had a lamp that had an outlet at its base, Dot plugged into lamp, lamp plugged into smart outlet. So when i was telling the dot to turn off the lamp, I was essentially telling the dot to turn itself off. Took me way to long to figure out my mistake.",0
1,"Good luck setting this up.
  
",8.Jan.19,Yes,Instructions for getting these dot's to pair with Wi Fi are horrible.  You go in circles for hours.  I got one out of three finally to pair and I'm sending the others back.  Frustration level is not worth having these things.  Support was very patient with trying to help me but nothing they said made sense to me since I didn't see what they said I should be seeing on my cell screen.  I have two friends with a similar experience with these devices.,1
5,"Attractive, low-profile speaker
  
",8.Jan.19,Yes,"Functions are plentiful with Echo 3G.  Fuller bass acoustics.  Had to ask Alexa to increase treble.  Full volume is extensive compared to size of speaker.  Houseful of Echo speakers would be sufficient for most people to listen to music and watch videos.  Set-up process took a few minutes.  Seems phone or Kindle has to be held about same height level as the Echo 3G and at least 3 feet away from it during set up so that Bluetooth can find the new device.  Also, takes a moment for the Amazon Internet signal to appear on your wireless device to connect to, so be patient.  Meanwhile, satisfied customer.",0

",8.Jan.19,Yes,"No lie, the sound on these new 3rd Gen Echo Dots is LEAGUES better than the 2nd Gen Dots. If you have to pick, buy these 3rd Gen Dots hands down over the previous models. In fact, it is so much better than the previous, that I find it to be fairly close to as good as the full sized Echo. You won't get the volume with it that you do on the full sized Echos but you will get the clarity for sure. All in all, it's a no brainer.

Only drawback, to me, is it won't use internal speaker when connected to an external one. So I can""t turn my stereo off and still use Alexa without unplugging the external source cable.  Also when connected to a stereo the speech of Alexa is much softer then the music being played so is hard to hear.",0
2,"Offline issues.
  
",8.Jan.19,Yes,"I have 6 echo dots, 5 being gen 2. Never had any problem with any gen 2. The one gen 3 I own goes offline by itself at least once a week. I've considered sending it back. The sound quality between gen 2 and gen 3 is awesome. Gen 3's sound is 10x better but the connection issues have me pumping the brakes one upgrading any of my gen 2.",1
4,"I can't believe I waited so long to have one of these
  
",9.Jan.19,Yes,"This little gadget is amazing!  I'm still learning about the things you can do with this, but so far it's just so much fun and practical.  I have one in my living room and one in my bedroom (2nd Gen).  I did noticed that the microphone capabilities of the 3rd Gen are not as precise as the 2nd Gen.  I think my 2nd Gen picks up the sound of my voice much better and the speakers sound louder.  However, the 3rd Gen speakers sound fills the room more (if that makes sense).  The tasks, reminders, alarms and communication features are awesome.  I don't have a telephone in my house and this device is my new phone.  My son calls my phone when he gets home from school through the Echo and I also call him whenever I want using the drop-in feature.  I also love my night and morning routine and the sleep sounds options... they help me start my day in a good mood and go to sleep relax.  Overall, it's a great investment!!!",1
5,"So much fun
  
",9.Jan.19,Yes,"OK, I haven't figured out half of what this does but we are definitely having fun with it. I say, ""Alexa start"" and I get a flash briefing I set up. For me it is a Bible verse of the day, the weather forecast, a news briefing, a word of the day (which the kids and I try to use in a sentence), and a briefing from a pod cast that I like. I have changed this and will continue to tweak it, there are hundreds of different things to choose from. My son who has one has a whole different routine it goes through in the morning.I also got one for one of the kids and can say dinner is ready, and they can hear me us stairs, so no more yelling up the stairs or stopping to text. I have always thought it would be great to have an intercom and with the 'drop in' and 'announce' features I do now.We also use it to play trivia, specific songs, and to find out information. I am looking forward to figuring out more of what it can do with different Apps. I think it will have some great uses in homeschooling.Will be getting at least one more.",0
2,"Read the fine print before you buy
  
",9.Jan.19,Yes,"Alexa can play music from your music collection.  Yes, but only if you bought the music from Amazon.  If your digital music collection contains music purchased elsewhere, Alexa won't play it.  Amazon says that's for security reasons.  So the policy is not to force you to buy all your music from Amazon.  (Apple does essentially the same thing with its devices.)Alexa can read your calendar, email and contacts.  Yes, but only if you pay extra to access your mailbox if is on a Microsoft Exchange server, which is the most common mail server in the world.  Amazon says that's because Exchange servers are used by business.  Yes, businesses do use Exchange mail servers.  But lot of private users like me also use mailboxes on Exchange servers.Amazon, like other companies that sell both hardware and services, appears to be moving toward a business model where the hardware it sells will be increasingly limited to exclude commercial activity with any firm that competes with Amazon.",0
5,"Better than I expected
  
",9.Jan.19,Yes,"This was my 1st experience in the modern world of ""smart"" devices in the home.  I've only had the Dot's (totaling 4 now) about 4-6 weeks so I'm still learning what you can/can't do and have enjoyed them (for the most part).  I do enjoy asking for a particular musical artist or song or genre of music and it retrieving it for me.  I also enjoy being able to integrate the Dot's with a Firestick as I cut the cord when I purchased the Amazon Dot's.  Altogether it has been a very positive experience and no complaints as of yet.  There is still much to learn, much to discover....",1
5,"Meets all my expectations
  
",9.Jan.19,Yes,"Huge improvement from 2nd generation dots. I bought two of these to replace a 1st generation echo we had in a small ""sitting room"" in our house.I have these two 3rd gen dots in a stereo pair and they sound great for the music and volume we listen to. Usually no higher than 5, and listening to classic rock and Jam Band music. In my opinion this stereo pair sounds better than the single 1st gen echo.Obviously no earth shattering bass, but I feel they are very ""full"" sounding. I'm considering adding an echo sub at some point, probably will if Amazon ever runs a deal on it.I don't think you can beat the $50 I spent on this setup. Not sure if they would sound as good in a larger room, but definitely working well for my need.I'm thinking of adding at least one to our laundry room. Besides bathrooms, laundry room is only place without an echo. I couldn't justify the cost of a full sized echo in there, and the old dot wasnt worth listening to music on. This 3rd gen just might be the sweet spot to getting music everywhere in our home.",0
4,"3rd gen dot
  
",9.Jan.19,Yes,"I have 4 2nd gen dots and love them, so I tried the 3rd gen.  sound is superior to the 2nd gen. but I have to reset way too often.  looses wifi connection approx. every other day.  I never lose connection with the 2nd gen.  also I like how I plug the 2nd gen into a cordless usb charger and use outside.  can't due this with the 3rd gen as it uses a different charging system.  but sound is great.  I use this one now in the main room and the 2nd gen has been moved to other various rooms in the home.  based on sound quality only.  sound is about double the volume and rich sounding base.  again this is no Bose, but decent sound for the price.",0
5,"Fun purchase
  
",9.Jan.19,Yes,"These dots are really nice. We use them to play music while exercising or cooking, and to play ocean sounds at night for sleeping. I even bought one for the garage to play music while working on stuff and getting my hands dirty. We also like that you can tap the cancel mic button and turn off the microphone while it's playing music and it will still play music while the mic is turned off. That's a nice feature for us with our trust issues of devices always listening. It's also very nice that it lights up a red light ring around the top and of the mic button as a visual aid / reminder that the mic is turned off.",0
4,"The future... Today!
  
",9.Jan.19,Yes,"Initially I had a heck of a time getting the Android app to find this thing and connect to its built-in Wi-Fi AP to set it up. In fairness, I got sidetracked by something else and I didn't get to trying to set it up until 20 minutes after I plugged it in. I wound up unplugging it and trying again and it seemed to connect that time.Overall I'm pretty happy so far. It's controlling my Kasa smart outlets by voice as well as my aging (but gracefully) Ecobee 2 thermostat.Maybe I'll ask Alexa to order me up some more smart plugs tomorrow.Move over, Jetsons!",0
4,"I like it
  
",9.Jan.19,Yes,"Started small, just recently, with an Echo Dot rather than the bigger model that I guess most folks use as their main unit. It performs well overall, especially for the things I specifically wanted it for (being able to remotely turn lights on and off, as I have an erratic schedule). Sound quality is really quite good for such a small device. I do wish it was possible to get better, more detailed and location-specific weather forecasts (those of us who work outdoors need wind info), and that there was more flexibility in setting up the skills and routines, but overall, I like it a lot.",0
1,"on my 2nd one - both bad sound
  
",9.Jan.19,Yes,I have returned the 1st one because the sound was muffled and scratchy at times. I now have the 2nd one and the sound goes through the same ups and downs.  I finally turned on only the bass and it removed the scratchy sounds but of course I'm hearing all bass now.  Not sure this is the way speakers should be.  I'm very disappointed in this item but I love my other 4 devices and they are older versions.,1
5,"Nice Improvement Over the Echo 2
  
",9.Jan.19,Yes,"I have several Echo 2's, which I now use to provide input to my sound systems. They work fine in this capacity. I had originally purchased an Echo 2 for the bedroom but was not happy with the quality of the sound and replaced it with the Echo 3. The third generation's sound quality is superior and well worth the $10 difference in price if you want to play music from it. All my granddaughters got Echo 3's for Xmas this year and are quite happy with them. I have no problem communicating with Alexa on it. Works great!",0
1,"Huge downgrade from the previous version.
  
",9.Jan.19,Yes,"Worse speaker, worse microphone, huge delay after saying ""Alexa"".  Bring back the old version!!!",3
5,"Love
  
",9.Jan.19,Yes,"The speaker on this one is way better than my 2nd generation dot. I use Alexa for everything now. I ask her how the weather is, how my commute is, I have her read me books and play music, she turns on and off my lights and when it_ time to go to sleep, she plays the most wonderful nature sounds for me all night. My only complaint would be that my boyfriend and I have the same prime household membership and we can_ separate our Alexa_ from each other. For example, I get all his calls and we can_ create separate grocery lists.",0
4,"Fits my minor needs
  
",9.Jan.19,Yes,"I bought this solely for multi-room audio streaming. If google had that capability, I would have gone with them in a heartbeat.2 of the 3 I bought are hooked to stereo systems.  I wish there was an option to use an AV cable AND the built-in speaker at the same time for when I don't want to power on the stereo to ask a simple question. Other than that and a white noise machine for the bedroom, I don't use it for much.  Maybe to ask about the time and the weather when I'm in bed.",0
3,"The Alexa functions work fine.  The speaker function leaves a lot to be desired
  
",9.Jan.19,Yes,"I was given a Dot for Christmas and set it up to control several electrical circuits in my son's bedroom.  This function worked like a charm.  I decided to purchase a second for my bedroom.  In addition to the Alexa functions, I wanted to replace my bluetooth speaker.  Why have two toys that perform the same function.  Plus, Alexa can change the volume via voice command.  Alas, as a speaker, the Dot sucks.  There is a lot of static and crackling during playback.  I can playback the same song on my older speaker with no issues.  I'm not expecting concert hall sounds, just something reasonably clear.  The Dot fails.",0
5,"Finally a clock!
  
",9.Jan.19,Yes,"Finally a clock on the echo dot! After upgrading all my 1st generation dots (3 total) because of the better sound quality (huge difference)... They add a clock to the dot! So for Christmas I upgraded them all again! Absolutely love the clock addition, and has been long over due. Just wish I didn't have all these extra dots now. Hopefully they don't come up with another addition that I can't resist. I still have the very original Amazon echo in my kitchen and love it!",0
5,"Extend your Ech/Alexa enabled home with the latest Generation of the Echo Dot.
  
",10.Jan.19,Yes,You can think of the Echo Dot  like an extension of your overall Echo/Alexa network giving you Automation in any room you set one up in even if that room is out of hearing range for you main Echo Hub. Plus since they can send commands to other Echo/Alexa devices among other things you can turn them into an intercom system for you Echo/Alexa enabled home. Imagine being in the kitchen and you just put dinner on the table. Rather then having to chase everyone down to come to dinner you can just stay in the kitchen or wherever one of you Echo control devices are and call everyone to dinner. Their main improvement in the latest generation (3rd Generation) was the addition of several microphones (making it more responsive) and an improve speaker for better sound playback quality. This means they can also serve as a radio or a news source. It's not high fidelity but given it's size the sound quality is pretty nice. They are also very reasonably priced given all they can do.,27
3,"Sorry Alexa
  
",10.Jan.19,Yes,"UPDATE:WOW, Alexa is great, the speakers are okay, not great. I mean the rest of this stuff right now is just plain silly.I originally gave a 1 star because of this.I thought the Amazon Music Individual plan worked like this,* You can only play on one ""Speaker"" at a time, grouping does not work with the Individual plan, period.BUT it works like this,* You can only have one ""Stream"" at a time,  but grouping will work for that one stream on all speakers in that group with the Individual plan.Yeah, I wish Amazon would make this more clear in their drop-down menu (only place I could even find anything, sad). All they need to do is add a few words,Individual Plan: (""add"") ""Single"" Stream tens of millions of songs from any device  ""or a group of devices"".Pretty simple. Especially since the Family Plan says ""Stream on up to 6 devices at once."" makes it look like it is the only plan that lets you uses more than one device at the same time.Still only 3 stars because of issues 2 through 10 which still apply (See below before you buy)...ORIGINAL POST:WOW, what a horrible overall experience. Alexa is great, the speakers are okay, but Amazon has just totally blown this for its main capability, playing music. I mean the rest of this stuff right now is just plain silly. I'm returning 2 Dots and an Echo plus because Amazon was so smart they put up roadblocks at every option to try and use these ""Smart Speakers"" as ""Speakers""! Basically, the only way to use these speakers as speakers is using Amazon services. Please keep reading before buying!.1 Multiroom is only available via Amazon Music, there is no other way to listen to all your speakers at once, period!.2 Playing on multiple speakers is an upcharge via Amazon Music..3 Playlist through Amazon Music requires a minimum of 5 clicks per song (think about that)..4 There is no way to use or upload ANY music you already own ( or even a way to compile playlists from that music).5 There is currently no way to import or create playlists externally..6 If you use Bluetooth or AUX for outputting sound from the Echo speaker's the speaker sound is turned off..7 The Dots have no input option, so you can't even just use them as a dump speaker..8 I tried multiple equalizer options and nothing I did made these speakers sound all that great. They basically have no range..9 They don't play in stereo either, they play in mono, one channel on all speakers playing to the same thing..10 This is basically a toy, get a Kid Dot if you want, and maybe in a few years this tech will have arrived, it's not here yet.I could go on but I had the Plus for less than a week and the Dots for less than a day.",0
3,"Has not improved too much
  
",10.Jan.19,Yes,"**Appearance**The new look of the echo dot 3rd generation looks way better than its previous models. It has a more modern look with a nice material finish on the outside so that it looks less like a hockey pick and more of a well-designed device. I love the customization options for it, the designs look well made and smooth, but I wish they would add more there's only 3 when there are so many colors out there! It doesn't seem like you can take off the outside cover on it; so you'd have to buy it from a third party. It's also slightly bigger than its other models but it's not something noticeable.**Setup**It is not powered by a micro USB like the previous model instead it comes with a power adapter that you plug into a wall. This removes a lot of freedom such as plugging it into a computer or using another form of power. Having that accessibility is important because you want to give the customers all the freedom they can. With a micro USB, you don't have to worry about having to plug it away from where exactly you want it. The way it is set up is by the Alexa app. The setup is relatively simple but for me, it took longer than expected as I would be connected to the wifi it was on but it would not give me any further steps. It wasn't a big deal but I thought it was worth mentioning.**Performance**It has great functionality it is useful for hooking up to devices such as smart lights, door locks, etc. It can read notifications off your phone with the voice command, control other devices, listen to music, play games, make phone calls, and a plethora of other stuff. It also has an audio jack for you to connect speakers to if you do not like the built-in speaker. You can get traffic updates, weather information, and you can even connect multiple echo devices. It is very useful for example, if mom is in the kitchen and the food is done, she can announce the food is done via her voice and let an announcement out to inform others. This is very useful for when you're far away in the house making it convenient instead of having you walk you the designated person. It has functionality that you can use. The echo dot also has skills. One example of an of a skill is the find my phone skill. Doing this will let Alexa make a phone call to your phone which can be used if you cannot find your phone.*What I dislike *One thing I very dislike is the fact it doesn't hear me quite often. I'll be 10 yards away and I have to yell for it to hear me which is very annoying. I have to be very close to it to hear me; this is a very big let down for me. Now the music. You can only play off of a radio station or have a subscription to pay to Amazon. However, on the Google home mini, you can play music off of Google Play Music for free. I do not think it should be so difficult for these smart speakers to force us to buy a subscription for such a single task.*You should get a Google home mini instead*The google mini has more customizations, for starters, you can edit the voice from many different choices. You can choose from male and female, and even different accents. On alexa, you cannot change the female voice which limits users by a lot. The Google mini looks better and has mostly the same functionality as the Alexa.This is a good device and is very useful. If you plan to get it I'm sure you'll love it and it'll be very useful, however,  when you look closer into the details, you'll see its competitor can be the better device.",0
2,"Not Ready For Prime Time
  
",10.Jan.19,Yes,"While this is very cool technology, the actual performance of the product is mediocre &amp; at times utterly exasperating.  I have several devices, hooking into stereos in various rooms in the house.  At times it performs perfectly, and at other times it is nearly impossible to get it to play the same radio station that you play every morning [one specific example:  ""Alexa, play Vermont Public Radio.""  Response (again and again on some mornings): ""Playing Maine Public Radio....""]  The words ""Vermont"" and ""Maine"" don't even sound similar, so I don't know why it has so much trouble with this.  Sometimes Alexa has no trouble finding my playlists on Amazon Prime, but at other times it cannot find playlists, even when I stand right next to the device, use my best elocution, and ensure that I have the name exactly right by reading it directly from my phone.  In summary, this product was released before it could work as promised.  Amazon has apparently decided that the most lucrative business model for this product was to release it early, without warning consumers that we are all, collectively gullible beta testers.",0
5,"This is a product that belongs in every home
  
",10.Jan.19,Yes,"I was always curious about Alexa; I wanted one, but never wanted to spend the money. Last month I put it on my Christmas list on a whim, and that was one of the best gifts I_e ever asked for. I_e always been an Apple person, but Siri isn_ even in the same generation as Alexa. Alexa is far more advanced than even my millennial mind expected. Imagine making dinner and simply asking for any NPR program, slow relaxing jazz, 70_ Disco, Cher or any other  genre/podcast/artist you could possibly desire and it immediately comes true in a sound quality that is next to none. Alexa does that. She answers questions, responds to compliments, adds to your grocery list, continues the conversation and can teach you a little something about everything.I bought a 2nd Echo just days after receiving the first one. This product isn_ overrated, it_ the standard and you should have one!",0
5,"Super stellar Sonic hearing ability never fails to amaze
  
",10.Jan.19,Yes,"This product is clearly ingenious. It's basically the computer you don't have to type into did that responds instantly and is native in the fact that it will adapt to your style of interaction. It's not without its quirks, but I feel that once I learned better how to use the Alexa app everything will be groovy. The ability for voice recognition above my blasting of whatever music and background noise and the like is probably the most interesting thing to me, although there are so many thousands of things that you can do with this item I'm sure you'll find something less dorky. I also purchased a second generation Echo and the sound quality is only slightly marginally better, I wouldn't say it's louder, just more Bass. Additionally, despite it having more microphones for voice recognition it fails to pick up like the 3rd generation Echo dot does. I'm still trying to learn what all the light rings in flashing mean but I find it entertaining to look at. I'm 100% not concerned about the fact that there's a microphone in my house listening to me all the time, I do not believe that there is malice intent nor even really ability to utilize something such as this in a negative fashion against somebody. Plus the worst thing it could hear is me talking on the phone with my sisters. Hope I helped.",0
5,"Great speaker, Love the Echo Dot
  
",10.Jan.19,Yes,"We love our echo devices. We have a Gen 1 echo and a Gen 3 echo dot. The Echo has better sound and seems to have a slightly faster response time, but the Gen 3 echo dot doesn't come far behind. Great sound, compact and small, and does everything you expect Alexa to do (we mostly listen to music and control the thermometer and use it as an alarm). My 15 month daughter always turns around and looks at the Echo or Echo dot when I say ""Alexa..."" and she loves it when the blue circle lights up and the music starts playing. The dot is a great price too. Alexa can use some improvement on answering information questions better, but we've noticed she's been getting better.",0
4,"I love it
  
",10.Jan.19,Yes,"I love it and bought another one so I could have one in my kitchen/living room and one upstairs in my bedroom. It's especially awesome for list making but also when I'm cooking or doing dishes in the kitchen it's nice to be able to change shows, volume, etc on the TV without having to go grab the remote. It's also handy to be able to just voice a song request but the speakers aren't the greatest and I've had some difficulty connecting it to a few gadgets - that's the only reason for the 4 star review. Also you can't control volume or on/off power of your TV through Alexa unless you have a smart TV and you're able to connect the two. Just having a firestick won't do the trick",0

",10.Jan.19,Yes,"Everyone we know has an Echo but it wasn't in the budget right now so thought we'd try this little gal. Love her. Alexa is great. I use her to set reminders constantly, as well as timers, adding stuff to my grocery list, and to play music. We have a fairly small house so this size is fine for our downstairs, sound is actually great for small-ish rooms. Its not crazy loud and we dont crank it up, but for semi-loud background music its great. I'm not a super tech person so I cant speak to all the other crazy stuff other reviewers dont like, but for me its great. Like having an assistant, which I desperately needed LOL :)",0

It_ nice to be able to have Alexa perform certain tasks on command like playing certain songs, setting timers, or anything in between. The only flaw of course is that it can be glitchy. It doesn_ always quite hear your voice commands or follows them so you find yourself repeating the same thing to a computer multiple times. I_e had to unplug it too just so it can reboot. It can definitely  be frustrating but it_ worth the price for what you want it for.",0
5,"Don't Judge By Looks Alone
  
",10.Jan.19,Yes,I have the 2nd gen and 3rd gen echo dots.  I had read MANY reviews that the newer 3rd gen didn't sound any better than the previous 2nd gen.  But then I saw one at Kohls and decided I would check it out in person.  I'm sure glad I did because the sound difference has definitely improved over the 2nd gen dot!  I was very impressed with the sound quality and would have no problem using one in a bedroom application.  Bottom line... if you're on the fence about it... go to Kohls and hear it for yourself before making a decision.,0
2,"Previous generation worked better.
  
",10.Jan.19,Yes,"I own 2 of the previous generation of the Echo Dot and one of this gen. This one seems to have a hard time hearing its wake-up word. Also, the old one had no problem hearing me over the alarm or music that was currently playing and this one can hear if the volume is above 6 and there isn't a pause is audio. I literally have to wait for pause in whatever is playing to catch its attention.The only plus side is that the audio does sound a little better and it looks little more modern than the hockey pucks.",0

",10.Jan.19,Yes,"Should be able to adjust the speaker lever with my voice.Should be able to kill the light show at nightNeed to be able to do more,  and answer more question as the ""OK google"" function on my phone. Tired of asking Alexa and still having to ask google, I just stopped asking Alexa.And for the size of some of these things, they should start making the rechargeable battery operated version of this.Finally, I don't know why I thought this would be louder.",0

",10.Jan.19,Yes,Calling this AI? Total bs.Not user friendly. Does not understands or responds consistently. Configuration of smart home devices is a Nightmare. Less nightmare if you buy the suggested brands. Few games and skills are good or work properly. The bluetooh only connects to one speaker at the time. The multy speaker option works whever Alexa feels like. And  I find incredibly stupid that you can not add a skill to a routine.Alexa is a good speaker for the price that says hi to you. Thats all.,0
3,"Sounds better when it does.
  
",11.Jan.19,Yes,"Initially I was going to write a higher review but I have had some issues with the New Dit. Unfortunately at times it sounds Very Fuzzy, like a Buzzing sound. This will be during any random song.  Sometimes the Same song will sound fine. Other times it can just sound horrible and I just yell for Alexa to STOP because I can't stand that sound. Almost seems like the speakers are just messed up half the time. When it works, it sounds Way better than the Echo 2. When it gets fuzzy, it's just awful. Also, I paid $30 New and NOW they're charging $50. THAT Is why I also Can NOT give it more than 3.",5
2,"Stay away fron the 3rd Generation
  
",11.Jan.19,Yes,"Overall, I like the functionality of the device, but Out of the box, my speaker has sporadic static as if the speaker is blown. Sometimes it's clear,  sometimes it's sounds like it's raining in the background with music and Alexas voice. It's a known issue with a 3rd generation dots (google it). I've filed a ticket with technical support and they're giving me the run-around that they'll contact me when they have a solution but refuse to give me a credit or replacement under the warranty until they figure it out. I'm very disappointed because Amazon usually is good with returns with items that they sell from other manufacturers, but when its their own product, they'll guve you the run around and fight you when its an obvious flaw with the unit.",1
5,"Alexa is fun and a little silly. Great games and music!
  
",11.Jan.19,Yes,"I keep her on mute most of the time so she doesn't hear our conversations. The reason I bought her was because my son loves the song 'Baby Shark' and I wanted him to try to tell Alexa to ""play baby shark"". He tries but he's still working on his language skills being under 2 years old and all.My Husband and I love the game 'Song Quiz'. It's soo fun! My favorite era to play is 2010s. My Husband likes the 90s and 2000s. Overall, we like her. She can give us the weather in our city. My Husband had a hard time getting the weather forecast for a ski resort an hour away. Anyways, we have a great time with her. She's funny and fun. I just wish she could carry on conversation without having to go to the A.I. feedback app or whatever it's called. Love the trivia games she has!",0

",11.Jan.19,Yes,"Got one as a gift for my mother.  While waiting for it to arrive, I went and bought one for myself at a local retailer.Best.Decision.Ever.  Nothing like asking Alexa to play your music while your hands are in dish water or having her call Mama while you are making dinner.  Hands free is the way to go.  Weather report, traffic, news, music and even compliments at a whisper.We love her so much that we bought another for the house and I even got one for my desk at work.  She plays all of my music and radio channels that won't pick-up in my building.  When the phone rings, I simply say ""Alexa mute"" and she stops. ""Alexa Resume"" and we are back in business.  Lots of easter eggs and fun.  She can answer almost any question and can even fart or bark on command.  Life is complete.",0

",11.Jan.19,Yes,"The sound for music throughout our house is really good. I purchased three, one for eachlevel of house. The sound is so much better than previous versions I_ so glad I choose not to save $3 per device and go with the old ones. Use mostly for music and life loves it. Started using lists for shopping and try new things all the time. Upstairs one is between kids bedrooms and starting to try as sleep sounds. Also use the drop in feature and use as baby monitor when watching movies in the basement late. Using announcements too when time for dinner or time to leave, beats the heck out of yelling across the house. I_ sure I_l get a few more or may try the Echo Plus for even better sound and move some Echo dots around.",0

However, being able to play the music throughout the whole house across multiple devices is a huge plus, especially if we're planning a party or just cleaning the house. Likewise I'm learning to use the Alexa more effectively in calling for the type of music I'd like to listen to. Setting up the devices was easy. Once I got one setup, the others just needed to be plugged in from the box. I should note that I have the Echo Dot Gen 3 and the Echo Gen 2. The Echo Dot Gen 3 seems to carry sound just as good as the bigger Echo for a fraction of the price. If you're going to buy one, buy two.",0
5,"Echo is for us, Google mini wasn't
  
",11.Jan.19,Yes,"We love our echo dot. Great sound and responds to voice commands really well. We use ours in our kitchen and I love using the timer feature. It's easy to set a timer on my stove, but Alexa makes it even more hands-free. Some times my hands and fingers are dirty, so I feel it is a nice bonus to have that ability via a simple voice command. It's our first one so I can't compare it to the 2nd gen ones that I've read about, but I love this one. We bought my Dad a Google mini, because he has used his girlfriends in the past and he's not too tech savvy so I didn't want to throw him off, but I like my Alexa much better. I don't know why, but I just think Alexa responds to my voice much easier and knows exactly what I need. BONUS is the added Amazon prime music. We are prime members and it is much easier to find the music we want to listen to on the echo vs. the Google mini. Google mini only seemed to give ""related"" music stations to what you are searching for. For instance, Johnny cash. Google only gave us a station that played his music occasionally or more often, songs that they considered similar; while Alexa just gave us Johnny Cash (which is what we wanted). If I want 90's alternative, it gave me 90's alternative. This is our first time using the prime music feature with out prime membership and I don't know why we've waited this long. Now we didn't purchase anything extra with the Google mini, music-wise, so that might make a difference. But with the Alexa we would never have to (along with our prime membership which we already had). I'm not tech savvy in anyway, so if you want to get in detailed specs and such, I can't offer that review! we will be purchasing more!!!",0
5,"Biggest bang for the buck on the planet!
  
",11.Jan.19,Yes,"I purchased this Echo mostly for music but Alexa does so much more!  I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE _er!  There is much I still need to learn but from the first music I asked to be played, which was Mellow Jazz, I was AMAZED by the sound Nd I have BOSE equipment.  I called my man friend immediately to tell him he must buy it ( ECHO DOT Gen 3 ) he did and loves his too. I bought one for my son who is laid up for 3 months with a redo on leg surgery. He is still waiting because evidently this was a very popular Holiday gift but I can_ wait for him to get it. Yesterday I asked for Bird Sounds and you would swear my home was filled with them!  This is the best bang for the buck in the world IMO!  An excellent gift for anyone. You will also get emails so you can try new things to ask Alexa and there are supposedly over 1 thousand!  If she only played music I would be sold! THANK YOU for such a fabulous product.  Every morning I tell ALEXA _ood Morning and she gives me my local weather forecast. What more can I say? GET ONE or TWO or THREE! _",0
5,"A Tale About My Smart Home
  
",11.Jan.19,Yes,"Well, I now have Echoes in every room except the bathroom (that's next). And they have networked throughout the house so I can turn on or off the lights in a particular room without actually being in that room. Since I rely on Amazon for all manner of things especially purchases, it just made sense to choose Echo.  I can order things I frequently purchase as well as previous one-time buys so easily with Alexa. No regrets. The other day, I misplaced my phone, and no matter where I am in the house I can say ""Alexa, find my phone."" BaBam! Just like that I found it! It's official. My house is now smarter than I.",0
4,"Nice upgrade
  
",11.Jan.19,Yes,"This little thing comes with a lot of sound. Its so loud that I normally have it set to volume 5. My gen 2 I had to have on volume 10 all the time. The only issue I have is that when I use it as alarm for the mornings I set it to volume 10 before bed and it has a hard time hearing me tell it to turn off when the alarm sounds. Any other time ive ised it to play misic I have to yell ""Echo"" the name for it to hear me. If it could hear me better then it would get a 5 star. Plus the charging cord was changed from the USB to a different set up making it not as veraitile as before if you move it around at all. Other than that its a great upgrade from the gen 2.",0
5,"Dammed cool! Dammed cool device!
  
",11.Jan.19,Yes,"The things this can do is really amazing. The price is great. I bought the outlet control after receiving the Dot and it works flawlessly. It's like the voice command in Star Trek, really cool. For it's size it has pretty decent sound (and I am a picky former sound engineer). Great for a kitchen! I had a little trouble setting it up to my wifi but that was user error. Don't get frustrated if this happens. You can listen to the radio, make calls, hear news, local weather, voice games, I am only beginning to unlock it's full potential. With multiple units they are also able to be used as a household intercom. Neat product. It is linked to your account so in the app I made sure voice purchasing was set to off. YOU WILL NEED WIFI AND FREE ALEXA APP.For the price and capability I highly recommend this or any other of their new ""smart speakers"".",0
2,"Alexa works fine. Speaker and sound is garbage.
  
",11.Jan.19,Yes,"I bought two of the Echo Dot 3rd Gen and sent both back. I opened one and tried it out. The sound is horrible, even after adjusting through the Alexa app. They just sound like a muffled mess. And these aren_ rechargeable. You_l need to carry the power cord no matter where you take it. I realize this is a small speaker but I have a few other Bluetooth speakers just as small as this and they have great sound range. Amazon needs to go back to the drawing table on this one, as far as decent sound is concerned.",0
5,"An excellent improvement over the second generation echo dot.
  
",11.Jan.19,Yes,"Pros: The sound quality is greatly improved over the first and second generation dots.  Amazon has also refined the microphone system.  The new dot now picks up conversation and understands much better. I used to have problems with room echo with the generation 2.  Great looks, great sound and better microphones make this unit a hit.Cons: There really isn't any.  If Amazon would have included the internal thermometer as they did with the next gen echo plus this unit would have it all.",0
5,"Surprisingly loud!
  
",11.Jan.19,Yes,"I bought this for my toddler's bedroom, so she can control the lamp verbally and I don't have to worry about her getting burned or frying herself with an outlet (the outlets are hidden from her sight and reach though). At bedtime, I turn on the rain sounds for her to fall asleep to, and the speaker does a great job. It's not as good as the full sized Echo, of course, but hey--during the holiday sales this can be had for $25, sometimes even a little cheaper. Not much to complain about there!",0
3,"Had it for about a month
  
",11.Jan.19,Yes,"Overall its ok, I used it during the holidays for music, and also daily news casts.Its just been over a month now, and honestly, I have not used it in the last week to 10 days....It does take time to learn all the possible commands.Would I recommend it, not sure really. Its enjoyable at first but to some degree, its another piece of technology in my life, and really, too much tech in ones life gets annoying.The sound quality is good....",0
1,"Short warranty....
  
",11.Jan.19,Yes,"After 6 months of ownership my Dot started to malfunction. It was playing music randomly, often waking us up in the middle of the night. After spending 20 minutes with tech support I was told it needed to be replaced........... at my cost! My mistake for not reading the fine print, only a 90 day warranty!  I was offered a 15% discount on a new one. Seriously? When they go on sale they are 50% 0ff! I will be selling all my Echo products and changing brands....",0
4,"Incredible sound quality
  
",11.Jan.19,Yes,"I love my dot!!!  It_ everything as advertised and more. I love being able to play games on the dot with myself and my family, but I also love that I can link it up with other dots to play music or communicate back and forth.The only problem I have is this: every so often, it chooses to sound almost tinny. It_ only just slight enough that I notice it. It doesn_ last long but it does happen. I don_ think this is common to all Dots, probably just mine individually (so don_ think they all sound tinny- it actually has incredible sound when it_ working in full function!)I have been recommending this to all my friends. Sounds amazing with all genres of music and very helpful with the alarms and reminders and news reports.",0
5,"Can_ beat the price for how many things it does. It_ better than Siri on your phone.
  
",11.Jan.19,Yes,"I love my echo dot. I got the white and it_ so sleek. Alexia has a personality, it can be fun but also incredibly helpful. I use it also for timers, alarms, weather, the news, music and so on. It also can connect to Bluetooth so if I want to listen to music I just say _lexa connect to Bose speaker and then it plays through the speaker. It_ awesome and can_ beat the price. I also love listening to audio books on it. Pretty neat little gadget!!",0
3,"The Echo dot is OK for the price, but the Echo is 100X better.
  
",12.Jan.19,Yes,"I've been using the Echo dot and the Echo for about 3-weeks now. Everyone talks about the difference in the speakers and sound quality, so I'll leave that out of this review. What I want people to know is that the Echo is much better than the Echo Dot even though the Dot is 1/3 the price. I say this because the Echo Dot has a low-quality microphone. This is probably one of the ways they were able to reduce the price. Consider this:1. Responsiveness: I have the Dot in my room and the Echo in the living room. More often than not, when I say ""Alexa"" the Echo in the living room will respond while the Dot does nothing. Because of this, I had to change the wake word for my Dot. There are also times where I have to repeatedly try to wake my Dot because it just doesn't hear me. On the other hand, the Echo can hear me while I'm in the bathroom with the door closed.2. Understanding: A lot of times I'll clearly (and loudly) tell my Dot to do something, but it thinks I said something else. The Echo sometimes does this too, but the Dot does it much more frequently.I like the Dot overall, but if I could go back in time I would buy another Echo on monthly payments instead. It's just not worth the frustration of having to repeatedly yell at this hockey puck to get it to do something.",8
5,"Sound clearly better than 2nd generation
  
",12.Jan.19,Yes,"I purchased a second generation dot when Amazon put them on sale before Christmas.  I was not sure if I would like it and wanted to go with the least expensive starting point.  I really enjoyed it and bought a 3rd generation for my wife to use.  The functionality of the two is essentially  the same since they are running the same software.  However, the sound quality of the 3rd seems reason enough to purchase the more expensive and newer 3rd generation.  I also like the appearance of the 3rd generation.  The sound quality difference is not bad when Alexa is giving the weather or something like that.  However, we use the 3rd generation to play ocean sounds at night for sleeping and that is noticeably different and better with the 3rd generation.  I have used the app to group some smart plugs and have enjoyed the convenience.  I feel like we will continue to find little uses for the dot that make the morning routine a little easier and it is nice to play a little music while getting ready for work.  Do note that the sound quality is not what I want to listen to music in general but ok to have a song play while getting ready in the morning.  I would not sit down and listen to an album in the evening on it.",2
5,"2 Years Later Using Both: Echo is Much Better than Google Home Mini!
  
",12.Jan.19,Yes,"I started my smarthome with Google mini because they were, ...well Google (an AI company that will probably do a better job). Almost  2 Years later, I came to find out I was very wrong! While Google_ platform is slowly getting better, I found that Amazon_ Alexa  platform is actually a lot more mature with a wider variety of sensors and smarthome products. Software-wise, Alexa supports way more skills, like way way more. It_ not even close!Using both platforms side by side over the last year or so, I found Google assistant (despite being more accurate with factual answers overall) to be lackluster with _kills and extension/apps. Alexa also does a few things way better. For example the  _rop in feature alone on Alexa turning the echo into an effective in-house  intercom system is  so much better than Google_ one way intercom _roadcast feature.  Google_ system is just frustrating in comparison. In fact I ditched it all together so I can easily have 2-way conversations without having to repeat _ey google broadcast... and then waiting for a reply from the receiver. Alexa intercom system  is especially effective with guests and the elderly (who won_ know how to reply or formulate a broadcast message on Google_ system and just wind up flustered and frustrated with the communication method), etc.Despite running a mostly google smart home system these new echos definitely raise the bar.  They work well with my new Ring Alarm System (much more reasonable pricing both hardware and monthly service fees for 24/7 monitoring. By reasonable I mean over a 50% price difference for arguably a worse product -google being the worse product and charging double!).Hardware: Amazon raised the bar with these. Sound clarity on echo as well as mic sensitivity is  unbelievable when compared to Google_ Home Mini.  It can hear you even from across the room with its speaker playing.",0

",12.Jan.19,Yes,"I got this setup and half the time it takes 3 or 4 tries to connect to the network, even when the unit is virtually on top of the WiFi router. After only a half-dozen uses, it lost any connection to the network and had to be completely set up all over again. Sitting right next to the router &amp; my iPhone, it wouldn't complete the setup process until the second attempt. Disappointed in this product since day 1 and it just got worse every time I tried to use it. Will not buy another Google product!1/14/19 Received a call from a technical person at Amazon Customer Service to try and resolve the problem, which was unexpected.

",12.Jan.19,Yes,"Alexa takes over your life like a virus. We just love our new assistant. The kids have lots of fun with it. Our lights turn on and off on command.

They are just tacking on services I don't want to the colorful case that I want. So the kids got a grown up Dot for Christmas...2. One of the most powerful features of Alexa is the ability to play music. Those speakers are still well below par.3. The microphone is not quite there yet, either.Nice gadget with plenty of room to grow.",1
2,"Loses its luster after a few days
  
",12.Jan.19,Yes,"I feel like this is a novelty device. I had something more in mind but maybe I built it up too much in my head. I originally purchased Alexa and a few Wi-Fi plugs so I could control my Xmas lights with my voice. Which was super cool by the way but once I took my lights and my tree down there wasn_ a whole lot left to do. Now I have 4 WiFi plugs and an Alexa device just sitting there doing nothing. Every once in a while we get a chuckle out of her beat boxing skills (or lack there of) but then the laughter stops and I_ left with what seems to be a paperweight.It does do everything as promised so I can_ knock it for that but I would really like to see a fancier version, one that would display my security cameras when prompted to do so.

If I say Alexa play jack Benny it will play songs sung by Jack Benny, If I say Alexa open Jack Benny she will then let me listen to the Jack Benny shows that used to play on the radio.

Also there are certain apps or podcast I have trouble connecting to the Echo Dot. And if I have my bluetooth _N in my iPhone, it will disconnect any other Bluetooth device you may be using. This is annoying because it will keep doing it until you completely shut off the connection from the Echo. Other than that, in time I will get to know the commands and what Alexa understands.

Listening to music is great, as the speaker quality is very good, and stereo separation is nice.  However, when asking Alexa for the time or weather reports, the voice responses are noticeably harder to hear or understand than with the previous generation.  In addition, the two Dot 3's sometimes get confused as to which one is supposed to respond to questions, and occasionally, one responds, and then the other one responds to the same question after a delay.

I suppose if you already have a 'smart home,' it may introduce a new level of convenience to your life.As a very curious person who often wonders about all kinds of random things, usually while in the middle of washing dishes or fixing the garbage disposal, I was excited at the prospect of being able to simply voice a question and have an answer without stopping to pick up my phone or computer. But ""hey Alexa"" is a far cry from ""hey Google."" Easily 3/4 of the questions I ask ""Alexa""_hose answers could be easily found with a quick internet search_licit one of the ""I don't know about that"" replies.Also, if you're intelligent enough to seek out multiple different sources for your national and world news, don't expect Alexa to help there, either: there's exactly one option.From what I can tell, the Echo Dot is a pretty ingenious way for Amazon to get you to buy all kinds of other compatible devices. Without them, it's pretty useless.",0
3,"I wish I purchased a Google Home Instead!!!
  
",13.Jan.19,Yes,"I had the Amazon Echo for 2 months now, and I can confidentially say, I'm not 100% satisfied.  85% of the time you ask it a question,  it says it doesn't know the answer.  I try to ask the same question in.muiltiple ways and still I don't know.  This is the main reason why I bought it...to ask questions without physically googling them...I have google assistant on my phone it's excellent with answering questions. Another thing, if you have an unusual name, it would pronounce you name wrong and you cant fix it...which annoys the hell out of me!!! Google let's you write your name phonetically.  I wish I got a google home instead!!!!! Since I'm out of my return window, I guess I'll keep it.  But I'll definitely will purchases a google home, and use the echo as a back up.Some Pros1. Music sound pretty good coming out of it.  So you'll love it if you wanted a smart speaker just for this.2.  It can pick up your voice from a pretty large distance.",0
4,"An improvement on the last one
  
",13.Jan.19,Yes,"When I bought the previous Dot, THIS is what I thought it would be. I think Amazon finally got it right. Hey, this is a small, non stereo speaker. Some nice Jazz in the background or for a bedroom or office. Don't kid yourself, this is not a replacement for a larger Echo or other smart speaker or, even better, a basic stereo receiver with a couple of decent bookshelf speakers and, maybe, a sub woofer.I've regulated my old dots to the basement for _uard duty (when I finally get it) and when I am working around the house. They might also eventually be put into stereo mini jack to RCA duty, acting as a way to get streaming music to that receiver with those bookshelf speakers_or the new ones, I have one for a dead spot by the front door (also, Guard duty) and another in the guest bedroom. Fine for basic music and while not as dynamic as the full Echo models, good for some Jazz or classical or vocal background music.",0
4,"Learn someting new each day!
  
",13.Jan.19,Yes,"My Pastors have Alexa products throughout their house and told me I was on a ""slippery slope"" with a laugh. I'm beginning to think they are right. Just one Dot is not enough. Now I want the outlet adaptors, another for my bedroom, possible one for my office....The learning curve can be frustrating at times. I've been an Apple products user for years and expect a certain level of cooperation from my electronic devices. I've had to look up ""how-to"" many times with this little gift. But I will say, the more I ask questions the more it adapts to telling me what I need to know. I just tracked my first Amazon order since receiving this Dot and was able to add the ability to know when the order arrives. Since I work from home and sometimes don't know a package has been left, this should be convenient! I'll know more tomorrow!",0
4,"Works OK, but not exactly what I wanted
  
",13.Jan.19,Yes,"I bought this for one purpose, to have music when I go to bed.  I like to go to sleep listening to music and I liked the idea of being able to tell Alexa to turn it off whenever I was done.  It actually does this, but I had to create a playlist from Amazon music for songs that were already on my computer.  A friend told me that I could have the echo play music from my desktop pc, but it turns out that is not true.  Or maybe I don't know how to do it.  My PC does not have bluetooth, so I bought a usb bluetooth adapter, but the connection could not be made for some reason.  Either the Echo did not recognize the adapter or the adapter did not recognize the Echo.  I do use the Echo to answer questions and will probably use it for other things as I discover needs.  Just wish it would play the music I already have.",0
5,"Love! Way better than 2nd generation!
  
",13.Jan.19,Yes,"I had the 2nd generation, but decided to try the 3rd generation. It's so awesome, I ordered another for myself, and 3 more for Christmas gifts! The music output, is sooo much better, and I paired my two in my livingroom, so I have a left and right speaker. I keep my old one, by my bed, for alarms. I had never looked into all the things that an Echo Dot can do...now I use mine all the time! Lists for shopping, groceries, apts, and I haven't listened to so much music, in a very long time! Paired my Amazon music, SeriusXM, Pandora, etc. There are also, so many add on programs, I live alone, so ""My Buddy"", is available to call Sherriff, hospital, or my kids. If I fall, I just have to tell my Dot which to call, no matter what room I am in. You're going to love it! My kids and grandson sure did!",0
5,"Very Handy
  
",13.Jan.19,Yes,"It's a great help through out our home.  I don't have to scream through out the house to make a statement.  I love the fact that she plays all types of music in that particular room. Her jokes are so dry I love it. The reminders are so helpful. Timers are exactly what I need all the time. I love that I can take her anywhere as long as I have a wifi connections. I just found out that she can remind me to change my toothbrush... OMG. I'm always trying to remember what month it is. Now I don't have to think about it... she'll think for me. My only question - can she work in a bathroom. I want to place in the bathrooms, but I'm not sure if they will withstand the moisture. Great Job Amazon!!!",0
5,"Alexia Helping with House Lighting
  
",13.Jan.19,Yes,"Sound quality and volume level are excellent. Purchased (2) Echo Dot speakers for use with Lutron Caseta wireless electrical wall and lamp switches.  One Echo Dot placed in  family room and other in living room.  Everyone in the house now tells Alexia to turn on  and off these lights. Alexia is asked to turn lights on at a desired percentage of illumination, change the percent or turn the lights off. Lights come on immediately at desired level and not at full level and down to desired level.  The two Echo Dots are our first experience with this product. Besides using the Echo Dots for lighting control we are enjoying all of the information that Alexia can quickly provide, including time, outside temperature, timer, and information on an enormous amount of topics.",0
3,"Issues
  
",13.Jan.19,Yes,"I bought this because I already have a 2nd generation and it works great, however, this 3rd generation says it can call contacts from your phone but mine doesn_ want to contact to my contacts from my iPhone . So it says that you can ask to call mom mine doesn_ because it won_ connect to my contacts, so needless to say I_ not to thrill with it. It also says that the sound is better then the 2nd generation and that_ not true. So if you decided to buy one I would suggest to get the 2nd generation which is cheaper and works just as well.",0
5,"Making my rooms smarter
  
",13.Jan.19,Yes,"Bought three of them for additional rooms and love them!  I had stayed away from them in the past thinking the sound would be bad, but I was so wrong.  Full sound from the little critters.  Hooked one up to my house stereo too... that way I can listen to what ever music I want just by talking to Alexa (need Amazon Music or Apple Music).  But it is making me seriously re-think my large album and cd collection (yes, I guess I'm dating myself here ;).  At the $30 price, there is so much convenience in them you should consider them in all rooms you spend a good amount of time.",0
1,"Sucks!
  
",13.Jan.19,Yes,"Uh hate, doesn_ sink at all wth hot spot, does not pair with iPhone at all via Bluetooth. Can not search internet.  Honestly I don_ get the point of this thing.  It_ decent speaker for laptop that_ about it.  Would definitely go for google home or something instead.  I only got this because it was free with serious xm radio subscription.  Would Not get again.",1
4,"It_ Alexa!
  
",13.Jan.19,Yes,Great Alexa. Does what every Alexa does. I gave 4 stars b/c the 3rd gen has a new plug and I don_ like that. Gen 2 you can pull out the Alexa cord and use the USB base for something else if needed which is really convenient for my house as I have children who own 100 different toys that charge with a USB charger now and guest come over and will use it to charge their phones etc since it_ in the kitchen. I put the new one in my bathroom instead of my kitchen like planned since the cord is different.,0
5,"Just what I needed
  
",13.Jan.19,Yes,"I have not had a lot of time yet to use my Echo Dot, but so far it is just what I wanted to use in my kitchen to listen tomy audio book on, I have several different ""apps"" I can do that with, but his is just so easy  doesn't use up time on my phone, and it is right there where I am, I also found out that Alexia will read any book I already have loaded on my Kindle, for free, that is a great feature, and i am sure it will do lots more and I will have fun finding out what all she can do.",0
5,"Put a Dot on it!
  
",13.Jan.19,Yes,"I received this for xmas  I have been playing with it ever since. So far nothing but a good review. Although I have stumped it a couple of times.  However, it does learn and can respond quickly.  Will it replace your partner?  Interesting!  A great tool for handling things you might otherwise forget; like turning out the lights or controlling the temperature of your home.  I can see it also controlling some of your appliances; like the refrigerator or water heater.  I had it place meetings and reminders with recurring schedules.  Will it ever be a must for a home? Yes. Eventually.",0
4,"Alexa-Good Morning!
  
",14.Jan.19,Yes,"Received an Alexa Echo Dot #1 as a gift.  I have to admit, for a device I thought I'd never want or need, it's pretty nifty!  The convenience of saying ""Alexa:  Play Music"" is on the top of my list of her ""talents"".  I'm also pretty enamored with the shopping list feature.  Occasional rounds of Jeopardy or 20 Questions are good for entertainment, and quick checks on the weather report and traffic conditions for my work commute come in handy.  There are quite a few ""skills"" available, but many of them are ridiculous (I don't need Alexa to ""meow"").  Hopefully, there will be more useful ones added . The app itself could use some cleaning up-I find the list of skills reverts back to the top of the list after opening an entry to get more info.  There does need to be some fine-tuning with Alexa's ability to understand commands and requests, but all in all, I think she's a keeper.Addendum:  I purchased 2 more at a steal of a price, and then my insurance company gifted me one.  I now have 4.  Ridiculous, but I like asking for music with instant results.  I_ also ditching my morning alarm with sketchy reception and replacing with a dot.  Took a while to get that set up to my fave radio station, but all set now.",0
5,"Who can't have fun with one of these?
  
",14.Jan.19,Yes,"What might you use this for? An alarm clock. Multiple timers. Create a shopping list on your phone (Alexa, add chocolate syrup to my list.). A reference (Alexa, when was Mickey Rooney born?). A weather forecaster. A music streamer. A broadcast device for your home (Alexa, make an announcement. Dinner is ready. You'll need a few of these, but they go on sale often!). A calculator (Alexa, what is the square root of 144?). A translator (Alexa, how do you say automobile in Italian?""). Voice control of lights, thermostat, TV with devices from vendors like LIFX, Nest, Harmony. Leave voice messages for family or friends who also have this type of device. Plays environmental sounds. An intercom (Alexa, drop into Kitchen. Provided you also have one in the kitchen...). Alexa will also tell you a joke, carry on a (limited) conversation, and play games. All you need is a smart phone and WiFi. And there's other more sophisticated versions with better sound, or even video. Take the plunge! (Amazon should hire me.)",0
5,"Easy to set up and a breeze to use
  
",14.Jan.19,Yes,"I got this for my wife, first experience with Alexa.  Setting it up was very simple and easy with the accompanying app, Amazon has this process simple enough for anyone to do I believe.The responses and use are quite good, and the whole experience has been pleasantly quick and easy and useful, for the most part.  I do not believe that Alexa is quite as responsive as Google Now in some cases but all-in-all for the majority of time it works about as well as the other smart assistants out there.It looks nice too, blending in well with any decor I think, and isn't very noticeable.The ability to add 'Skills' is interesting though in some cases they are hit and miss when trying to connect to external devices.For the rock bottom price of these piece of electronics it's hard to beat, and it works quite well in general.  My wife loves the games you can play with it, like the music ones.",0
5,"New abilities Alexa has learned
  
",14.Jan.19,Yes,"My echo dot is for personal use only, and Alexa has been very helpful.Some of the new things are ""Alexa turn down the bass and turn up the treble and mid range"" ""Alexa whats the temp outside?"" ""Alexa text someone and send an emoji smiley face"" Alexa play the soundtrack for the movie ""Atomic Blonde etc.""""  Alexa how are you?""The echo dot has been a fun and interesting addition to my existence and I plan to add a connection to my stereo soon.I like that you can be working on something like a project and you can ask Alexa for detailed instructions on how to perform this task. A computer without a GUI to view but a speaker to hear is an interesting concept. If your in to technology and electronics I recommend buying and Echo product.",0
5,"Nice step up from 2nd Gen
  
",14.Jan.19,Yes,"I've had a couple 2nd Gen Echo Dots for nearly 2 years now and have loved them ever since I got them.  When the 3rd Gen Dots came out and I read the reviews I couldn't wait to get my hands one one.  They're just slightly larger than the 2nd Gen version, but you'll barely notice the difference, and it's totally worth it for the improved speaker quality.  The speaker on this version is much clearer and provides much more base than the previous generation.  It also seems to respond better to my commands than the previous version.  Best of all it integrates seamlessly with the existing 2nd generation units I have setup as a household so I can continue using those in lower traffic areas of the house.  Overall very pleased.",0
4,"Not what I expected, but great potential
  
",14.Jan.19,Yes,"I went into the Amazon Echo experience expecting a lot from this device, rightfully so, I heard a plethora amount of news and reviews about the little guy. I am impressed with the abilities, but also feel that it lacks some very key, yet small, details. Details like simply understanding my voice and not completely butchering what I say at times. I was expecting to be able to simply have a conversation with the Echo Dot and it would have a conversation back with me, but it seems it's not the case exactly. You have to say specific sentence structures in order to do what you want it to do. Although I understand its technology, I had a different idea going in to my experience so I hope you understand where I'm coming from. HOWEVER, just as my title states, there is so much potential with this device, I know in time the Amazon team will make it an exceptional device so I will be holding on to my device until then. =)",0
1,"Bye felicia
  
",14.Jan.19,Yes,"Got it for free because i got the amazon credit card. This thing is creepy. I let it die and threw it in a drawer and plan on selling it to my worst enemy. It_ also kind of useless since you can_ use it as a speaker for music just amazon music which... let_ be honest, we all want spotify. Anywayssss ya one star for this bad girl.",2
5,"Impressive bang for the buck
  
",14.Jan.19,Yes,"Considering everything you get for the price this an extremely high value devise, especially on sale. This 3rd gen Dot is attractive, conveniently sized, and has decent sound. I have my Dots wired into better sounding systems anyways, yet the Dot has surprisingly good sound consideing it_ size. Build quality also seems excellent. I expect my Dots to last a long time. I purchased Dots others too and as far as I know everybody_ pretty happy.  My favorite uses are for radio stations such as NPR with crystal clear reception with no need for antenna and multi-room audio do I can rock the house down.",0
5,"Easy to set up, fun, and useful.
  
",14.Jan.19,Yes,"I wasn't looking to purchase this product but when I saw it was 50% off on Black Friday, I decided to buy it.  It was very easy to set up and begin using.  I quickly learned how to make a shopping list, play music from a local radio station, ask Alexa various questions, and send messages to people I knew that owned an Alexa device.  I even had Alexa telling me jokes.  That was the end of my knowledge of what the Echo Dot could do.About a month after I purchased it, I came across a book called ""Amazon Echo Dot"" by C. J. Andersen on a free book website I subscribe to.  This book was specifically written for the 3rd Generation Echo Dot.  I am only 20% through the book and now have learned how to connect my Echo Dot to my smart phone calendar, TIVO, and blue tooth.  Alexa now tells me what is on my calendar and can change the channels on my TV just by asking.  I know that I will learn a lot more of its capabilities as I continue to read more.  I am very glad I purchased the 3rd Generation Echo Dot.",0
5,"Not as intimidating as I thought!
  
",14.Jan.19,Yes,"I won this at a family Christmas Party. I wasn_ sure I needed or wanted one. I thought this is a great way to see how it works. When I got it home I set it up. It was very easy and intuitive. I was glad I already had an account. I also have some light switches that are WiFi controlled as well as a speaker. So now I can control lights, music and speaker. If you don_ already have those kinds of things I don_ know whether I_ recommend it. However, we are really having fun asking questions. We get immediate answers. Kind of amazing. You can ask the weather (for anywhere) the time, the date, trivia questions. We were watching a playoff football game and they had a rules expert explaining a ruling. I thought who_ this guy? I asked Alexa and she immediately told us his credentials and I found he was more than qualified to explain the rules. I had never heard of the guy. You can ask for famous people ages. You can simply ask for a timer. Say you_e cooking, you can say set a timer for 30 minutes. In 30 minutes she sets off an alarm. You can say play some music for 10 minutes. You get music for 10 minutes. I_ not saying everyone needs this. But I_ really happy I have one. I_ learning new tricks everyday.",0
5,"4th one purchased!
  
",14.Jan.19,Yes,"What can I say?  I love the Echo Dot!  I bought two then I bought one for my friend who really liked mine and just a couple of weeks ago, I bought one for my dad who was amazed by it.  I love playing the ""Coqui &amp; Crickets"" sounds at night as I'm heading to bed.  It reminds me of my time and Puerto Rico and takes me right off to dreamland.  I have to speak quietly to the one in my bedroom as the other one is in the living room and can actually pick up what I say....amazing microphones!",0
1,"Impossible to set up! App is worthless!
  
",14.Jan.19,Yes,"I can see why this was on sale. I_e downloaded the useless Alexa app and it_ a joke. Asinine Alexa keeps telling me my device is connected to the internet, then says it_ not. The app constantly crashes and has the worst ratings in the App Store, and now I see why. It_ frustrated me to the point where I_ ready to throw Alexa against a brick wall. Total garbage!",1
5,"Upgrade. Now.
  
",14.Jan.19,Yes,"Our first Echo Dots were second generation, and performed reliably and well. The sound quality, however, left much to be desired, so we use them these days as inputs to larger sound systems. They work OK for that purpose. The 3rd generation Dot, on the other hand, has significantly better audio: highs and lows are much extended, clarity is impressive. And they seems to easily hit twice the volume to boot. On top of it all, they look much nicer. Well worth upgrading.",0
4,"Cool. Irritating. Not sure I'm keeping it. (updated 1/21/19)
  
",15.Jan.19,Yes,"So the Echo Dot (3rd gen) is a pretty slick device. I've only had my pair for two days, but the learning curve is as easy or steep as you'd like to make it. Setting up routines, while relatively simple, can make you want to scream in some cases. You have no way of setting repeat to particular days. Your only options appear to be a single day, every day, weekdays or weekends. I work Sun - Wed. So to get my device to perform the routine the 4 days I need it to do so, I'm required to make 4 of the same routine and apply the dates needed to each one. Also, you set up your routine in the order you'd like to have it done (in my case - greeting, a particular song, news and then weather), but Alexa does it in her own order. (greeting, news, weather and then song) But the most annoying thing she does (and this may very well be a deal breaker for me) is that she talks over the beginning of every song you request. Those of us old enough to remember when AM radio was the only radio can also remember the DJ's talking over the intro and how frustrating it was -and now, still is.As for the performance - I was very surprised at how well the voice recognition works. Lots of background noise, dog barking etc. and I'd say she's been about 90-95% on getting it correct. And she gets better as you use her. The sound out of these little guys ain't bad. You're not going to throw parties with these speakers, but more than adequate for quiet background sounds or music. I have one in the living room and one in my bedroom paired up and they do reasonably well in my 1,000 sqft, home with wood floors. (no carpet to soak up the sound probably helps a bit) I've ordered another one and a sub to place in the living room. That will be good enough for a party, I believe.All in all I am very pleased with the device itself. Just not too happy with the examples above and a few other things. (navigating the app can be tiresome, but I'm sure this will improve with time and tweaking from Amazon) If anyone reading this review knows how to stop her from talking over songs - I'd really appreciate the tip. And judging by my scouring the web for a fix, so would plenty of other people.I'm moving forward with making the house a smart home with outlets, bulbs etc. But not sure Alexa will see it through to the end. I really do like the thing, but I can't stand DJ's to begin with and now to have this going on - I'm just not sure. That said, if the talking over intros isn't a thing for you - 4.5 stars easy.P.S. - As soon as I got mine up and running, I was immediately reminded of the movie Demon Seed. :)Update: After receiving another Dot, Echo and the Echo Sub - I'm keeping this system. The Sub adds much needed depth and bass. The Echo has been perfect for my bedroom and the 3rd Dot went into the bath. The Multi-Room Music function is awesome and I've learned to just accept her talking over songs considering what I've been able to get Alexa to do in the short time I've had it. Still not a 5, but getting closer. We have a pet iguana (in cold Ohio) and I plan on having Alexa run his lights, heat and humidifier. Alexa is much more reliable than my 16yo daughter when it comes to these things and it allows me to leave the house for extended periods and not worry about the iguana freezing or being burned. I'm installing window AC units in 3 rooms and having Alexa control those and doing away with the central air power hog that is due for replacement. All in all, this system can take over your house for you. Everything from ""Alexa, turn off lamps."" to controlling the dehumidifier in the basement to who knows what else. I am excited to see just how far I can take my house into the future with this.",8
5,"Great Sound, Learns your voice, Fun to Have
  
",15.Jan.19,Yes,"I normally would not have purchased this, but it was offered for an absurdly low amount of money for getting one of Amazon's Credit cards. I waited until Christmas Day *2018) to open and plug it in, and since have purchased two more!  The sound quality, for me, is fabulous. Once I got it working through the ALEXA APP on my Android phone, went through the short set-up, and started asking it questions (this is the way it learns your voice, BTW), I am EXTREMELY pleased with this device. It is in my kitchen, and I use it every time I'm in there, cooking, washing dishes, putting groceries away, looking up recipes.Sure, you have to add some SKILLS to it, such as games, sounds for alarms/ timers, and other SKILLS / APPS, yet what it can provide in an instant once that is done, is well worth it. Recipes that call for items in metric?  Ask ALEXA for the conversion. If you're waiting for something to cook and have to watch it, play ""TWENTY QUESTIONS"" or ""TRUE OR FALSE.""The only slightly amusing issue?  If you have more than one ALEXA operating device in the same area -- they both ""hear"" you say the ""on word"" ALEXA and talk at the same time. oops. I *think* there might be a way to change the ""on word"" (my term for it), so that your devices will know which one you mean. If I'm using my FIRE for recipes, both of the machines activate with the ALEXA word.Highly Recommend, and may buy for friends, if they don't have one.",1
1,"Disappointed and worried about the security issues
  
",15.Jan.19,Yes,"I bought these (several) because they were supposed to work with my Sonos to play Apple Music. I have invested heavily in Sonos, so I_ stuck but I_ increasingly frustrated by the app and difficulty of playing my music.The Echo will play Apple Music on its tiny little speaker but it STILL cannot play it on the connected Sonos. It keeps telling me that service is not supported.And, this part is the worst, when Alexa_ internet brain is offline or slowed down, the error messages make you think you have screwed up. It_ like, you have suddenly forgotten how Alexa works and haven_ said things exactly right. Internet search for _s Alexa down and you find out that it_ not you, it_ her.  This happened right after I bought them I almost burned them in the fireplace.BTW, I bought Apple_ HomePod when it was a hundred dollars on sale this Christmas, and at that price, it is totally worth it. It sounds great, set-up is far easier, Siri will set timers just fine, and control over my Hue lights etc is flawless. It synchronizes music with other HomePods and with the speakers you have plugged into your Apple TVs. (And Amazon has had some astounding privacy and security violations from Ring doorbell to Alexa laughing to recording hours of audio to send to unknown servers.) If you subscribe to AppleMusic the HomePod really the best choice.",1
5,"Great Voice Recognition &amp; Highly Impressed By Its Sound
  
",15.Jan.19,Yes,"I went into this solely for the smart functionality, but ended up blown away by how capable of a speaker this is for music at this footprint. I wouldn't put it above the Anker Premium Speaker, but the convenience of an always on hands free smart speaker with above average sound...great versatility.I already had 2 Insignia smart plugs synced to the Amazon ecosystem via the firestick remote and alexa app, so those played well with the Dot right out the box. Nice to have them hands free now. The functionality that was new to me was the integration with Verizon Fios. I expected the skill to be half baked or sluggish but you can really lose your cable remote and not care. ""Alexa, switch to Fox Sports 1 (ESPN, ABC, NBC, etc.)"".  ""Alexa, pause (resume, fast forward)"".  The Dot's voice recognition is very consistent which means all of this so seamless. This is a really great device.",1
5,"Better than I even expected !
  
",15.Jan.19,Yes,"I was able to get a new Echo Dot 3 right before Christmas. It has been even better than I expected ! Setup was very easy and quick. I was also able to pair my Dish Hopper to the Dot. Now I can just say, ""Alexa ! Change the channel to ESPN"" and it gets there quicker than I could pick up the remote and change the channel ! For someone that has had a stroke and losing the use of my right arm and hand this is really useful for me. I love to play music while I get ready for the day. I usually use an app on my Bluray player which is time consuming just to get the first song played. Now all I have to do is say,""Alexa ! Play Thumbs Up radio "" and bam! it's playing that fast ! I can check on the weather before I leave the house in an instant. The sound quality of the Dot 3 amazed me from the moment I first heard it. From the reviews I've read, it's obvious that most people don't understand that some rooms just don't carry sound very well.The unit is kind of heavy for such a small item which I assume is because of the magnet of a much better speaker than previous Dots. I don't know how anyone could complain about the sound quality of the Dot 3 considering how small it is. Some people complain about everything. Just keep that in mind before deciding not to buy this because of a bad review. Ten years ago this item would have cost you thousands. This item is well worth the price.Like anything electrical or mechanical,you have to learn how to use it and then how to best use it for your needs. It really isn't hard. If my wife was using this the first day then I can tell you, it has to be easy.I will be buying more Dots since I have learned that you can place a unit in another room and use as an intercom. Nothing so small and costs so little can do as much as the Echo Dot 3.",0
3,"Don_ Do It
  
",15.Jan.19,Yes,"I use several of the Amazon devices,hey I_ a techie. The 3rd generation dot has a different look although not much, and the new device performs well. If your expecting a major improvement for the 3nd generation dot your not going to find it. We were looking for better sound quality and found it isn_ enough to even notice in the 3rd generation dot. The majority of products used work only with the second generation such as the chargers and other connected devices because the power cable on the dot 3 was changed and certainly not for the better. This of course has no effect on the blu tooth capability_.Amazon can do better than alter the looks and change the power cord so my advise is to stick with your old device or if your a newbie get the dot second generation. You can but these at a very discounted price and most of the accessories are dropping in price as well.As far as the 3rd generation and the hype, don_ do it.",0
5,"3Rd Gen is an excellent choice!
  
",15.Jan.19,Yes,My family love the echo dot 3rd gen. Ita very handy with homeschool needs and general things like music &amp; weather etc. Set up isn't as easily done as one might think of you have a 2g and 5g connection you can hook up to. 2g is best but wouldn't work so we had to use 5g. Took a little while even with technician to figure it out. The only other thing I have against it is due to amazon prime alone. You pay for prime but cannot get music unlimited without it being extra so she won't play a lot of songs without it. Also audible is extra as well which stinks cuz that's a handy &amp; fun tool alone for my kids so we use free sites for all the above but overall alexa is a nice addition to our familys needs. The sound for this little thing is amazing.,0
5,"Pretty rad
  
",15.Jan.19,Yes,"I'm well aware that the machines are taking over but if they're gonna listen in anyway, I prefer they do it through my Echo.  I'm an Apple guy.  Like old-school Apple guy.  I was buying those ugly eMacs back in the 90's.  Alexa makes Siri seem like a Speak-N-Spell.  She responds instantly.  You don't have to wait to talk to Alexa like you have to with Siri.  I love it.  For $25, it's a steal.  We have a total of four in the house now so the government can listen to all of our conversations.  Still worth it.  I really like that I can use the drop-in feature to yell at my kids without having to get up.  Really helps with my old age kickin' in.  I can also change my thermostat when my fat body starts sweating in the middle of the night.  Overall a great wiretap.",0
5,"totally love it
  
",15.Jan.19,Yes,"I got this as a Christmas gift. I had been eyeing a lot of amazon smart home products and was lucky enough to receive this wonderful, generous gift. It's been a lot of fun. I'm admittedly a bit creeped out by the warning about how Alexa records everything going on in the background (she certainly has some good blackmail material at this point). I've had a little trouble integrating some skills, and for others it feels impossible to find the app that goes with the skill (apple vs google thing?) but overall i'm so happy with this product. I would definitely recommend it.",0
3,"Still has trouble hearing me and understanding me.
  
",15.Jan.19,Yes,3rd Generation still has a great deal of trouble hearing me even in a quiet room. It often misunderstands simple questions. I give it 4 stars because it is still extremely helpful in playing music and answering some questions when it does hear me. I tried using other wake words but it doesn't hear any better then the second generation. It also seems that the AI has not improved at all. It seems like Amazon has abandoned their artificial intelligence as it is not seeking to improve it at all. This can still only answer simple questions. If it hears me.,0
5,"Very entertaining
  
",15.Jan.19,Yes,Some have spoke of sub quality audio. As with any speaker system if you overdrive them the sound will become distorted.I have several of these devices and find them to be of high quality. I often listen to Amazon and Pandora music and find the audio to be of excellent quality for the size of the speakers. However if you attempt to turn up the volume to hear them in other rooms in your house you are overdriving them and the audio is degraded.Using Alexa with them for controlling smart plugs and things is of great benefit.,0
5,"Sounds Great and is Easy to Set Up
  
",15.Jan.19,Yes,"I've has this for about a month now and am still wowed by the sound that comes out of it.  I love my second gen dot, but this is a very nice upgrade. I only wish it was still powered by a mini USB rather than a propriotary plug and sometimes the trebel sounds like an AM station that is slightly tuned off its frequency when adjusting the equalizer, but overall it is a very nice addition to the Echo family at a very nice price. I just hope someone will come up with a battery base for it to make it portable.",0
4,"Pretty good to have around
  
",15.Jan.19,Yes,"Sound quality is quite good. Plays lots of good music.Pretty responsive to my voice requests, even from next room. Plays good guessing game with my grandkids. Good for news and weather. Cons: poor set up instructions. Tells you to download Alexa app, but not specifically which app. I downloaded wrong app and had to call for further instructions.Also, there is no online list of free music available. Have to find out by trial and error to learn what is  available without monthly fees.",0
4,"Better Sound Quality Then 2nd Gen, Less Sensitive to Wake Command
  
",15.Jan.19,Yes,"Have a 2nd Gen and this 3rd gen. Sound quality is DEFINITELY improved, but anything about volume 7 (which is pretty loud) only distorts sound and doesn't get much louder. I do have some complaints on the far field mics vs the 2nd gen. It doesn't seem to pick up ""Alexa"" command as easy. Could be my placement location, but I've had issues in 2 separate locations. The redesign does look nice and fits well with home decor. I use this in tandem with multiple Alexa devices and I'm overall pleased with it.",0
5,"My new Echo Dot
  
",15.Jan.19,Yes,"There are so many functions I like about my new Echo-Dot.  First of all, I love music.  Whenever a song comes to me and I start to sing, I'll say,"" Alexa, play We come to far to end it now, Smokey Robinson"" and the song starts to play.  Secondly, Alexa, play Jeopardy, and realized there's a lot that I don't know. But my favorite is Alexa, play relaxing sounds, Thunderstorm, Jungle night, etc.  And when I ask her, the time, weather, recipe, exercise playlist, it's very handy.  And I always say, ""Alexa Thank you.  I love Alexa.",0
5,"Love the Echo dot, but there is on caveat...
  
",16.Jan.19,Yes,"Pros:I love my Echos.  I have one in each bedroom to control lights, play music, wake me up, report the weather or news, get notifications on Amazon orders, play games, create calendar events and reminders, set timers, you name it.  These are wonderful little devices.  There is a phone app that goes with it that allows you do do all sorts of neat things like set up routines that do multiple things.  For example, when I say ""Alexa, Good Morning,"" and she turns on the lights, plays the weather, and then turns on my favorite music.Cons:After I bought three Echos, I discovered that if you have multiple Echos playing Prime Music, you can play the same music to all Echos in a group, but you cannot play different music on each device unless you pay for a family subscription to Prime Music or you set up the Echos to play music from other sources (such as Pandora or Spotify).  So if my son and I want to listen to music in our respective room's at the same time, one of us has to use a source other than Prime Music, or we have to pay $10/mo for a family Prime Music subscription.  I was a little irked by this discovery.Wishlist:I wish that Amazon would not require a monthly subscription to enjoy Prime Music on multiple Echo devices simultaneously.I wish there was a separate volume setting for the Alexa's voice verses music.  Sometimes I want the music at a low volume, but then you can barely hear her when she talks.I wish there were a few more options for wake words or even a custom wake word.  When all my Echo's had the default wake word, ""Alexa,"" they would all wake up when I wanted to speak to the one in my room, so I decided to rename my daughter's and son's Echos.  However, there are only four names to choose from.",2
1,"Simply refuse to stay connected and play music
  
",16.Jan.19,Yes,"Amazon won't allow pasting my same comments so rather than repeat my 3 of 4 paragraphs check my review on the Echo 2 (Sub Pair.)Devices continually drop connection to each other and the internet.  I have 9 different speakers and problems with all groups and all speakers at times.  I've reset, I've deleted and recreated groups and I've reset pairs many times.  But after 3 or 4 songs I ALWAYS lose a speaker or a pair or a couple of pairs.The app is also painfully lacking.  A secind rate attempt at best.  I'm very disappointed.I will admit that after my 1st poor review I recueved a call and email from Amazon.  But their only advice was to try the things I'd already done.  Rest devices.  Delete and recreate groups and pairs.  Just doesn't work.And if this was a wifi problem why does my phone Bluetooth connected to either my Bose Mini or HK Onyx 2 play perfectly fine fir hours on end..?",1
4,"Great for my parents and family! We bought 2 for the home.
  
",16.Jan.19,Yes,"Gifted two of these to my parents for Christmas and what a hit! Definitely don't need the bigger one IMO. Bought with Hue lights, an Alexa wall plug, and a universal remote for the TV. Sure it's got some issues here and there like not understanding, hearing the wrong thing, or speaking when not spoken to, but I still give it 4 stars. My main complaint is the app and way you link other apps is not intuitive. There are skills and accounts and alternate apps to download versus what comes with Alexa, etc. It was difficult to set up for me, a tech savvy 24 year old, my parents never could have done it on their own. But now that it's set up they love it! Use it to turn on their lights, turn the volume on the TV up, call family members, make announcements, and play games. We also have a lot of fun messing around from a distance, sending good night messages or changing the color of the lights for a laugh.",0
5,"Great sound, more depth than gen 2, and more reactive.
  
",16.Jan.19,Yes,"I had the gen 2, and upgraded to gen 3 after hearing it play music at a friend_ house.I am very pleased with this device, the sound in a multi-room set up is great, and complements well an Echo Or Echo Show.It is more reactive than the previous version, and the sound has so much more depth than the gen 2, the improvement is very impressing.I also like the new design, it feels more modern, and sits very nicely on our console.We use it every day to control lights, music, ask for weather, news, etc and has not failed once. I find the microphone more accurate than my Echo Show gen 1 sometime.If you are looking for a screenless amazon device, I would definitely go with the Dot. It is cheap and does all the things the Echo does, with a sound close enough to the Echo. If you are looking for a much better sounding device and have the money, I would recommend the Sonos One.",0
3,"Do NOT reccomend!
  
",16.Jan.19,Yes,"Hate it. She just randomly stops playing ALL my music, then tells me she doesn't know what is wrong...I should ""check the app"" and give feedback She cannot understand half of what I say, I have to yell (I am a quiet voice talker) so I am flinging spit droplets when I try to have her do anything because I am YELLING. She plays games with me and tells me my answers are wrong...then repeats what I said back, as the correct answer. I don't have an overly strong accent, I do not slur my words, I do not speak ghetto or whale...so I do not know what is wrong with it!I ask her to play ""Hits One on Serious XM"" she says ""shuffling songs by Frank Sinatra on Amazon Music""... _ but.. I really didn't know how good Frank Sinatra is, so thanks Alexa!",0
5,"Funny Story About My Dots!
  
",16.Jan.19,Yes,"I love my Dots! I first bought an Amazon Echo and loved it so much that I purchased 2 Dots, a black form my bedroom and a white one for my bathroom. If I_ not asking Alexa to play music, I_ asking her to tell me a joke or the meaning of a word or countless other tasks. One morning driving to work, my routine after a certain stretch of road, I pray to God, giving thanks, asking to get me to work safely and on time, what_ on my mind, etc. This morning as I reached my _rayer zone I started by saying, _lexia. I immediately caught myself and burst out laughing! I always start with _od, thank you for my life ...  Since God has a great sense of humor, I bet there was a little more laughter in heaven that morning.",0
4,"Alexa is FAR ahead of Siri
  
",16.Jan.19,Yes,"We are still learning all that this device can do but already, we are blown away at how far superior Alexa is to Siri on every level!!  We are pretty hard-core Apple device people but Siri doesn't come close to what Alexa can do.This Echo Dot is amazing in it's ability to understand questions, statements, commands, and it's capability to complete fairly complex tasks.  We are going to set up a second one in another part of our house which will allow us to communicate with each other from different rooms and set up chores lists for the kids (Yay!).  Don't know that Alexa will be able to make them complete their chores, but at least they can't say they didn't know what they were supposed to do each day!!",0
3,"Muffled sound &amp; DEFECTIVE controls when compared to Echo Dot 2nd Generation
  
",16.Jan.19,Yes,"Received my new ""electronic brillo pad"" and despite adjusting the bass, mid-range and treble controls in the Alexa app, I find that the new design emits very muffled audio. Sounds like someone talking through layers of fabric. Whereas I've had up to 5 Echo Dot 2nd Generation speakers in my home for over a year.DEFECTIVE controls. Alex app on smartphone refused to adjust volume. The buttons on dot 3 did adjust volume manually. The equalizer on Alexa app made ZERO difference in sound when I adjusted bass, mid-rabge and treble sliders up or down.BOTTOM LINE: Returning Dot 3 and sticking with Echo Dot 2s.",0
5,"Alexa remembers a Lot
  
",16.Jan.19,Yes,"Alexa isn't just to ask what the weather will be tomorrow. I changed the ""Awake"" word to mine to ""Computer"". You can ask it almost anything and it will tell you the answer or tell you something else entirely, like in the video I submitted. There's so much it can do, I'm still finding out new things to ask. It's most certainly worth the price. I bought two and will be buying one more for the living room too.",1
5,"Amazon echo is perfect for my house
  
",16.Jan.19,Yes,This one was a 2nd echo for my house and I am pretty satisfied with its design and performance. I am highly impressed with its new design and its microphone is much better than previous version.I will highly recommend to others to purchase it.,2
5,"Best dot ever!
  
",16.Jan.19,Yes,This is a fantastic platform for alexa.  I have 2 full size echo devices and 3 of the 3rd generation dots throughout my house.  I actually think I like the new 3rd generation dots better overall.  They are very small yet produce a great sound.  You can hang them from wall outlets or use a wall outlet shelf to keep them hidden and out of the way.  Overall for the price of these you can put one in every room of your house and link them out to get great sound throughout the house all at once.  I have bought them as gifts and couldnt recomend them more!,0
5,"3rd Gen Dot!
  
",16.Jan.19,Yes,"For under $30 you can't go wrong with this. It's small and so cool looking (3rd gen especially). How can something this small sound so good. Perhaps some sort of black magic that Amazon employs to make this quality product, I'm unsure. Of course it's much more than a speaker to listen to your favorite music on. Alexa will keep you company all day if you want. Sometimes I set her beside me and just pretend that she's sitting with me, binge watching something on Amazon Prime Movies. She gets me, she really does.  Now I think I have gone to far, have I? I never know. :)",0
5,"I love my echo dot
  
",16.Jan.19,Yes,"What did I ever to without my dot and Alexa???!!!  I tell her goodnight and she turns on my fan, turns off my lamp, and plays my music from Pandora.  Then when I wake up, I tell her good morning and she turns on my lamp. off the fan and music, tells me the weather and my schedule for the day.  I also use her as my alarm clock and timer for cooking.  So many great options!  The speaker is small and sounds decent when playing music.  It always needs to be plugged in, so it is not as mobile as I would like, but I still love it!",0
5,"Recommend to everyone
  
",16.Jan.19,Yes,"I have the echo dot in My kitchen under my counters. I love it! I especially love the wall mount accessory. I make grocery lists, to-do lists, set cooking timers, play games like jeopardy, plays music genres, announce reminders. I love it. I can pull up the info from my echo dot on my phone in my Alexa app (free). I can access the app and share my list. Example: go to the grocery store I can either pull it up on my phone through the app. Or I can text the list to someone who is going to the store for me.",0
5,"Have 2 in stereo, working great, even for music
  
",16.Jan.19,Yes,"As I mentioned, I've got 2 of these paired together, I've got them in my bedroom and primarily use them to play music while I try to get to sleep or clean and they've been working pretty well for that. Don't usually play them loud but I did see what they sounded like at max volume and I was actually impressed. Not perfect but I was definitely expecting worse. It's also nice that they will light up when a package arrives at my door. Plus combined with the Fire Cube it's nice just be able to ask Alexa to turn off the TV and to play music for an hour while I try to sleep from the comfort of my bed.",0
4,"LOVE IT!
  
",17.Jan.19,Yes,"I was pleasantly surprised by just how much this little guy\girl can do. I have never had any issues with this device recognizing my questions its always accurate and knows exactly what I am asking it. The one issue I have with it is unless you are a techy person you may never use it to its full potential because you may never really pick up on just how the ""Skills"" as Amazon calls them work. Basically you have to download an Alexa app on your phone and then setup the device but from there you have to download skills to really take advantage of this device, an example would be I downloaded a Fios Skill so that I am able to control my cable box with commands such as ""Alexa watch AMC on Fios"" The problem is setting up the skills for this to work I had to enable the Fios TV skill then I had to choose what cable box this device was going to control, well if you never named your cable boxes by the rooms they are in then you have to figure out the name the cable company gave your cable box. Anyways like I said once you get everything figured out its great. I have it tied to my calendar in Outlook, my cable box, my Fire TV, I use it to play music from Amazon ""Apple Music is coming to this device soon"" I ask it what my commute to work is like, what's the Weather today. As far as the Sound quality goes, this small device is perfect for a bedroom or office if you want good sound in a bigger room buy the ECHO or ECHO Plus its that simple. Still some issues in being fully implemented but getting better all the time. Besides updates, Alexa learns from how you use it. Do you NEED it? No. But did we need cars instead of horses? Jets over propeller airplanes? This is part of an interesting future. Hop on and enjoy.",2
4,"Why did I wait so long to try this awesome little dot???
  
",17.Jan.19,Yes,"The Echo Dot...not a hugely impressive name for such a neat little item! I had briefly considered the Alexa products off and on, watched the specials come and go but never really thought I would have much use for the device. When it popped up at a discounted price I finally decided to give it a try and see what all the fuss was about. I was actually just looking for a simple Bluetooth speaker for the shower but am so glad I chose this and ordered two.  WHY DID I WAIT SO LONG? This is the neatest device, small in size but very big on what it can do hands-free! I love how all I have to do is say, ""Alexa, play music"", and she will choose something random or I can request a specific artist or song. I don't have to reach out of the shower to mess with my playlist on my phone or to change the volume or anything else...I just ask Alexa! There are so many different things Alexa can do for you, from organizing your day to setting alarms and calling people on your contact list, to so much more!  My grandson is having a blast with it just asking random questions and was very impressed when she told a knock-knock joke last night! On the other hand, this device could possibly drive you crazy if you have someone that constantly interrupts what is playing to ask her questions or change music. My grandson has ADHD so this became an issue but I'm hopeful it will resolve itself once the new wears off, lol. I am so impressed that I am planning to purchase more units so that we can have them in most rooms.",0
4,"Side by side I decided to keep the Amazon Echo Plus over the Echo Dot
  
",17.Jan.19,Yes,"I liked the Echo Dot, until I received the Echo Plus.  The sound from the Plus was just so much better than the Dot.  If I hadn't received the Plus as a gift, I would have kept the Dot:  It was easy to use, easy to set up and responded as soon as I got it hooked up to my Wi-Fi using the app downloaded from the app store.  But...once I got the Echo Plus the difference in sound quality was pretty obvious, and since both do essentially the same functions, decided to keep the Echo Plus due to the better sound quality.  All in all it was very easy to set up, pretty much worked straight out of the box.  The only thing I wish Amazon would work on is getting rid of the plug which is why I took one star off my rating.  Having to use a plug makes these devices so much less portable.  I wonder why the Echos are still tethered to a power cord, in this day and age of easy Bluetooth availability.  I haven't used the Echo for anything more than asking simple questions and streaming music.  As of yet, I haven't purchased anything, made any shopping lists or used the device for any "" higher"" functions.  Maybe in the future I'll be saying ""Alexa, order me..."".  It certainly seems it would be easy enough.",0
2,"It_ OK I guess, but nothing to write home about!
  
",17.Jan.19,Yes,"My daughter bought me an Echo Dot for Christmas along with some special light bulbs and a special outlet to plug it in (if I can remember correctly.). The Echo Dot, I_e already set up with the app but have not used it to its fullest extent as my daughter wants to set up the other items but has been too busy to do so.  The light bulb is one that you can request the echo dot to turn it on or off.I have 2 things I don_ like about the Echo Dot.1). The plug on it is not USB but rather a BIG SQUARE PLUG that overlaps the next outlet on the power strip so I can_ use that outlet for something else.  Why in this day and age would a company like Amazon produce this BIG FAT PLUG?  They have produced all kinds of wonderful products with a USB with a removable plug so the product can be plugged via USB into a multiple USB charger or directly into its own plug.  It appears this product_ clumsy, oversized plug is from the past and it_ ironic that it_ attached to an item of new technology.  If it must have a regular electrical plug, they could streamline the size of it.2) In addition to the Echo Dot, I also own an Amazon Fire Stick that my daughter bought me for my birthday last June (2018).  The assistant wake-up name is Alexa.  Since the Fire Stick and the Echo Dot are used in my bedroom, I went to change the Echo Dot_ wake-up name to _ot but that wasn_ an option.  I had to name it Echo.  It would be nice to be able to use the app to change the wake-up name to almost any name you want.  I can only imagine how this works for people who have 6 or 8 Echo Dots!  Anyway, just a suggestion.  I was very disappointed that this device doesn_ seem to do much - except with added products like the smart light bulb.I generally like Amazon products but I could take or leave the Echo Dot.  I will keep it if my daughter ever gets around to setting up the smart light bulb!",0
5,"Great product
  
",17.Jan.19,Yes,"Gotta love the echo Dot, my daughter gave me one for Christmas and when I saw a second one so cheap decided to buy even tho honestly I probly don_ need two as my house is one floor and not large. But I want to try the white noise at night to see if it would help me sleep. My son gave me some hue light bulbs also and it_ nice to turn the light on before I get into the rooms. Also have tv hooked up to with a smart plug...another gift to turn that on off! Very easy to get the second one synced to the first tho the instructions a little off in that there is no orange light when pairing but it is a lime green. My son hooked the first dot  up for me So found myself waiting and waiting for it to turn orange before I realized it was all ready to use! Alexa doesn_ always get the commands right but 98% of the time. I took advantage of the six month payment too which was nice.",0
5,"My little Helper
  
",17.Jan.19,Yes,"She's more than I expected.  With Alexa I always have the forecast and can set reminders quickly.  Also love that she shuffles my Pandora stations while I'm doing cleaning around the house.  I do find that you have to be clear and precise in how you say your commands, there are often times that I've had to repeat myself because I delayed in saying a command or because i'm in another room i have to yell for her to hear me (especially if the playing music that is very...bombastic?).  I'd like to see her improve her ability to find answers via internet, other than that I find her to be quite delightful.",1
5,"Great product!
  
",17.Jan.19,Yes,"I purchased 2 of these Echo Dots while they were on sale. Installation was a snap. I paired them as a stereo speaker pairs for music playback. I have other Echoes also in stereo pairs throughout the house for casual music listening when playing Amazon Prime or SiriusXM music. They sound good.  The Echoes or the new Echo Dots can't compete with my main stereo sound system but they sound great for the price and a better than the 2nd Gen dots. Plus, I use them to control my Smart Lights and Smart Switches, and Amazon Fire TVs throughout the house! No regrets with purchasing them. So, if you're thinking of buying one or more, don't hesitate.One minor thing with configuring (all types of) Echoes as stereo speaker pairs .. the Amazon app assigns a generic name to the pair. If you have more than two stereo pairs, like I do, it can be a little incovenient trying to figure out which generic named pair is in which room before telling Alexa to play music on the stereo pair that you want it to.  I'm sure that Amazon will eventually enhance the echo stereo setup to allow you to define more meaningful names (such as living room or den).",0
5,"I was hesitant at first
  
",17.Jan.19,Yes,"I was hesitant about having an Alexa at first. And I still don't love the idea of Amazon listening in on my household. But the convenience is pretty awesome. We love using it to play music around the house. The kids just shout ""Alexa, play _____"", and like magic it comes on. We also use it for our shopping list, which is nice to be able to just again shout out whatever item we've run out of and need to add. And ""she"" understands us all (even the 3 year old), which is impressive and more than I can say for other electronic assistants (such as Siri). I did have to turn off the feature allowing Alexa to purchase things for us as I am certain my children would have taken advantage of that. So, even with my hesitancy, Alexa has won me over! I'm very impressed.",0
3,"3.5mm jack output volume is disturbingly LOW
  
",17.Jan.19,Yes,"I would give this five stars. The sound quality through the internal speaker is vastly superior to the old Dot, and almost comparable with a full Echo. Definitely good enough to listen to music through the internal speaker.However, the volume output on the 3.5mm jack is about 50% of the volume that was delivered by previous gen of the Echo Dot.  What's up with that?  I formerly used an older Dot on powered speakers (PreSonus Eris E3.5) and I used to be able to set the volume at 50%. With this new 3rd gen Dot, I have to set the volume to 100% to get the same volume.So, all other things being equal, it would seem this new Dot robs your system (if using 3.5mm) of half its power. That's quite a crime.",0
5,"Spontaneous kitchen dance parties up by 100% !
  
",17.Jan.19,Yes,"We got a Dot for Christmas and we love it. We have automated most of the lights and switches on our first floor. My kids love being able to say ""Alexa, play (insert practically any song title here)"" and then a 3 minute dance party happens in our kitchen. Not to sound too corny, but it has brought our family a little closer together as a result of the instant fun that happens as a result of having the Dot.  Its great to be able to play music while preparing meals, or really anytime.  Love saying ""Alexa, Goodnight"" and having all the lights that were left on turn off, instead of me going around the house turning them off one by one. Now we need to get one for upstairs!",0
4,"Overall a good product
  
",17.Jan.19,Yes,"It works well for most of the things I am using it for.  At times it seems to have a problem understanding what I said. I bought two and like that I can stream music to one, stop it and then continue with the other.  It also works well with two smart outlets that I got.  My biggest complaint is the difficulty in getting the skills using the Alexa app. It doesn't indicate which skills you already have until you click on the skill then when you go back to the list of skills it starts at the top instead of where you left off and with hundreds of skills listed this does not work well at all.",0
5,"Does what I wanted it to do
  
",17.Jan.19,Yes,"I admittedly bought this echo dot for one purpose: to replace my xbox one kinect on the new xbox I got that doesn't support the old device. I missed the voice commands to turn it on, off, pause, etc... and so this was the next best thing.For the $30 I spent, I'm quite happy with it's performance. It understands me 99% of the time and is quick to perform tasks. The sound output is surprisingly clear considering the size and form factor. I have found it's basic capabilities (e.g. setting reminders, timers, routines, etc...) to be useful as well.",0

I like the responsiveness of ""Alexa"" to command and it was able to fulfill requests correctly, most of the time. Mostly, I use the echo to hear music, the quality of the sound is very good, clear on the high frequency and deep enough bass providing richness of what you expect from a music or songs. I am slowly adding additional Alexa compatible devices, such as the smart switch and I was able to command Alexa to turn on or off the light in my room. Although like many other people, I have my share of concern to what other thing that the Echo is listening all the time.",0
1,"F$&amp;# These piece of $&amp;$#
  
",17.Jan.19,Yes,Don't waste your F&amp;$#ing money on these pieces of $hi$.  They never respond and the software is a comical sideshow.  Amazon claims they are the future and they are not.  They can't pickup your voice an inch away or a mile away.  Stop being lazy and take back control of your home.  Because when you need them to work they won't.  They get progressively worse and are a complete waste of money.  Don't do it!  I literally just threw mine in the trash. All three of them.,1
5,"Alexa can play from Apple Music
  
",17.Jan.19,Yes,Such a fine product built with great intelligence.The design of 3rd Generation Alexa is much elegant compare to 2nd generation. The fabric finish is on par with Google Home Mini.The skills that Alexa posses are simply amazing. I got this product at rite time. Now Alexa can stream Apple Music. I can ask Alexa to stream music on it from Apple Music. The Audio quality is really good.My house is run by Alexa. I can ask her turn on and off the lights/AC/TV and of-course ask her to play shows and movies on fire TV. Great deal for the price I got it.,0
5,"Easy to Set up, Easy to use - But not always understanding what's being asked.
  
",18.Jan.19,Yes,"We just brought Alexa into our home this year - and this was purchased for the Bedroom to supplement the Sonos Beam and Fire tablet for the Living Room.  It was super-easy to set up and start running on our existing system.  It generally does what we ask - tho it's taken some time to get accustomed to some odd functions, such as the pulsing  green light that indicates when an Amazon delivery has arrived for us, but when you ask why it's pulsing, she won't tell you. (Had to look that up online to get the light to quit)  It understands most voice commands - far better than Siri ever did - but we have to laugh when Alexa gets things completely wrong.  We were under the impression that you could name it whatever you wanted - as a trigger word - but you can only choose from ""Alexa"", ""Amazon"", ""Echo"" and ""Computer"" - and there's only one voice, no male options at all, and you're warned about using an accented voice  unless you want to speak using a different dialect.  The sound quality is quite good for such a small device - It's not Audiophile quality, and music doesn't sound as good as on an iPad Air, for example, but all in all it's a good little device at a great value.",1
4,"Really great, but still has some problems
  
",18.Jan.19,Yes,"We have 3 in my house.  They work well with my SmartThings, they play Pandora, they do quick math, conversions, answer simple questions, etc.When they lose their internet connection for whatever reason, (or Amazon is having server trouble) any time you say ""Alexa"", they ding and say ""I'm having trouble understanding you right now"" which is super frustrating, and I wish they would say whether it's a local connection problem or a server problem, but I guess it's not an all-the-time thing.They are usually great about identifying where I am, but on occasion I'll be standing right next to one when I ask for something and one in a different room will answer me instead.Adding things to lists with my voice is very easy.  Sometimes they don't get the words quite right, but it's usually close enough that I know what it was supposed to be when she repeats it back or I look at it on the app.  Removing things from lists with my voice, however, is a real challenge.  If it's a one-word thing, usually no problem.  Two words is difficult but possible.  3 or more words and you're better off checking it off in the app.Wish we could rename her to something custom, instead of their default set of options, but I get that programming wake words isn't trivial.Can't talk about her without her trying to answer.  In my house we call her by a different name when we're talking about her than when we're talking to her.  Early on we figured out if you talk about her casually she can have some pretty big misunderstandings and almost sent messages to some old contacts and ordered things on Amazon.",0
5,"Absolutely wonderful devices.
  
",18.Jan.19,Yes,"The third generation echo is a great device. I now have a whole intercom and music player. I love the Drop in feature where you talk to your devices from anywhere. You can also make announcement and it will play on all of your Alexa devices. Paired with smart plugs, you make your lights, fans, etc fully automated.  I have a Ring 2 doorbell as well and it can be tied into Alexa. It makes announcement on all devices when motion is detected and when the doorbell is pressed. Of course both of these options can be turned off or on in the Alexa app.I also set one of these up as the kids editionwoth freetime. Yes that is right, you do not have buy the kids edition, you make one of these by simply turning on freetime in the app.I know there are concerns about privacy, but I have no issues. These things have made the house easier and convenient through automation. It also makes family time fun with games.",0
4,"so far, mostly just for fun
  
",18.Jan.19,Yes,"i started w/ some ""fun things to try w/ alexa' (a story from one of my tech pages). when i started to try other things i thought i would find useful, i got many 'i dont know that' answers. ie; alexa, what temp to cook skinless chicken? (obviously worded better than i type) i tried some 'fun' stuff of my own; 'alexa, what time is love?' ( a KLF reference). many other neat things like when i say 'thank you' ( i dont know why i do this other than my upbringing) i get 'you bet' or something similar, pretty fun. but until i get a door cam or sonos or lighting controls, still just a play thing.  tried connecting to cortana, not much use there other than using my desktop calendar, which connects to my windows phones. wont connect to my music on my system, or i simply havent figured that out yet, only pandora and amazon, et al so far. trying some of the 'skills', not finding much use there either, but i've only had it for about 2 weeks. we'll see...",0
5,"Nice Additions!
  
",18.Jan.19,Yes,"We already had the full size echo and enjoy using it daily. I got a the Charcoal and Heather Gray ones for Christmas to maximize voice coverage since our main echo is in a central location and doesn't always hear clearly when there's a lot of activity going on. I put it in our living room and it has helped tremendously! The other one is in my crafting area in the basement and it works great. The drop-in feature that allows you to talk between units is very helpful. I didn't think we'd have much need for that, but it does come in handy. They weren't on my Christmas list, but I'm very glad my husband got them for me. These two are very nice additions to our household.",0
1,"Packaging a Joke! Was this a prank!!! Amazon is so inconsistent!
  
",18.Jan.19,Yes,"I haven't set up this Echo Dot yet. I have others and like them but they aren't accurate a lot. My opinion is it/they need more work. Simple things Alexa doesn't pick up on and other times she picks up on harder things. Very confusing but fun for sure. My issue is with the way they shipped it. It was on back order (white) so when I received it yesterday I was shocked to see a mangled mess of what once a box that was shaped into a Charcoal Briquette Chimney Starter for no reason at all! On top of that it was a mess and no tape on either end. Anyone could have just pulled it out, plus it was dirty and just stupid... Get it together Amazon... PLEASE!",1
4,"Much better sound than the 2nd gen I had before
  
",18.Jan.19,Yes,The 3rd gen Echo Dot that I purchased has noticeably better sound both in terms of quality and volume. I was a little disappointed that the new Echo would not fit into the holder that I had for the older one but I suspect that the Gen 3 device being a bit larger is a result of the better microphone and better speaker arrangements and it is a price I am willing to pay.  Now if I could just get the other older Dots I have to stop thinking they hear their wake word in all manner of words and conversations I'd be a totally happy camper.,0
5,"Amazing sound from this little guy
  
",18.Jan.19,Yes,"Works great and is a huge upgrade in terms of sound quality from the gen 2.  This one gives more of a surround sound feel.  The setup is also very simple.  The added cloth on it gives it a much nicer look.The only downside is this echo is more heavy than prior so when using it with wall mount it tends to say, but this is easily fixed with a piece of double sided tape or velcro.  I put a picture of this, and unless your actually looking its completely not noticed.",0
4,"Works Great, Sound needs Improvement
  
",18.Jan.19,Yes,"It was a Christmas gift from our son and his wife.  It was easy to set up and works well.  I have noticed that various Sirius/XM channels play at very different volume levels and must be adjusted after starting to stream each station.  Also, the sound is a bit inferior compared to some bluetooth speakers with which I am familiar.  I find that my wife, who is not tech savvy or friendly to any large extent, uses it as much as I do.  A good basic beginning.",0
1,"I bought the 3rd Gen for better sound and Stereo Pairing
  
",19.Jan.19,Yes,"I grew up in an era of sound appreciation where the stereo norm was to have Bose or Advent speakers and super high quality hi-fidelity equipment. When reviewers said the Echo Dot 3rd gen had better sound I should have known better. The echo 3  might have shifted its frequencies to the lower end compared to the weak tea Echo-2, but the price of more bass was clarity. The midtones and lows are muddy and in my opinion less favorable to listen to than the 2nd gen echo dots. As for stereo pairing, at first it was nice waking up to having two Echo Dot 3rd gens in stereo  40 inches apart placed on my bed Head Board. But then they kept slipping out of synch. Then you have two roque echos basically doing what they want, making random selections and the sound going up and down and in and out. So you have to re-synch or unplug one, which is what I did. Another disappointment is the Echo Subwoofer. Ughh ! I will just have to wait until Amazon takes High Fidelity and Stereo-phonics seriously.",2
1,"Waste of patience
  
",19.Jan.19,Yes,I thought I was getting a good deal when I got this echo dot thru a promotion Amazon was doing! Buy Amazon music subscription and get an echo dot for only 99 cents. Priding myself on how frugal I as as a person I couldn't miss the opportunity! But Alexa has been more of a curse than a blessing! If I could give it 0 stars believe me I would! I first tried placing it in the living room where I used to keep my old echo the tall speaker but my ex took it. I put Alexa in the living room thinking it will be just like old times but she doesn't listen to anything I say. So I tried my room that didn't work either then finally the bathroom where it's super quiet. I am a very stressed and depressed person so I bathe about once a day it's like therapy for me and with music it's even better. So I will tell Alexa to play a specific song and she will play every song but the one I want. I even got Amazon music unlimited and it didn't help! So I will for example like five minutes ago say Alexa play I belong to you by love unlimited and she will play a country song or Alexa play my thang by dubee. Do you want to set a reminder? No Alexa play you remind me by usher playing Taylor Swift you belong with me. No Alexa be quiet stop.. light flashes keeps playing the song. Until I have to scream at the top of my lungs for the thing to shut up. Once I got so mad I unplugged it from the wall and broke a soap dish because I was so frustrated. This thing is awful I don't know if I got a defective one or what. Then she finally plays the song I want by love unlimited and one minute the song plays I'm thinking finally I can relax and bam it just stops on it's own. This thing is a headache and my boyfriend has trouble too and we both speak very clear I've tried every distance I've tried the Alexa app trying to train her to recognize my voice. Nothing works I'm ready to throw this thing in the trash it's not worth the stress and frustration it causes. I'm better off getting a waterproof Bluetooth speaker  because this isn't working out not ever. It's not me it's her and I would sell it but I would feel bad for putting this burden that is Alexa on someone else. I had an echo and it worked great never had an issue once with being heard wrong now I get this dot and it's been nothing but a nightmare. I don't even want my money back for what a dollar? I want the stress and frustration this has caused taken away the only solution I can think of is throw this thing away or give it to someone I don't like for Christmas minus the fruitcake. I would rather have fruitcake then an echo dot. I am not a fan and will not be purchasing again.,0
3,"Needs some work, but still a better assistant than me.
  
",19.Jan.19,Yes,"Overall:  I'm into it.The routines feature is great for triggering multiple events, (""alexa, help me wake up"" triggers the kettle to turn on, my lamp to turn on, alexa reads my news and todays calendar, tells me to have a great day, and then starts my morning playlist. It would be nice to have her start with the music and then slowly trigger my other actions but unfortunately right now music triggers must be at the end of your routine chain) also for creating your own commands/responses/jokes (""alexa, what do you think about my roommate?"" returns ""I don't know how you put up with him"")Theres definitely a learning curve to the setup and specificness of commands, it's not something I would buy for a non techie type, unless you set it up for them and give them a list of specific things to ask her. But if you're a gadget type, the options are endless.You can stream your music/audiobooks through My Media for Alexa (free trial, then $5/year subscription for this service, pretty disappointing but in the end, worth it if you don't use itunes) or ask her to play radio stations/podcasts from a variety of sources, or NPR. Currently I am working on Alexas location commands, so that she will remind me about things on my phone when I leave the house, or arrive at work, although I have not been able to get that to work.Overall, theres a lot of kind of annoying things that get in your way when you're setting up alexa (too many useless skills being the most annoying, but also figuring out the curve in talking to her; when I initially got My Media, I would ask her, ""Alexa, play harry potter from My Media"" but she would suggest ""harry potter quiz"" or ""harry potter on audible"" and we would fight, but after looking at some suggestions from My Media, I realized I should be asking her like this, ""Alexa, ask my media to read harry potter and the sorcerer's stone"" so no more annoying suggestions) but she does make a great personal assistant and has greatly improved my morning routine.Pros: she connects to my bluetooth speakers, she connects to my media collection without needing to put it on the cloud, she can read stories, play interactive games/trivia, remember things, help you make lists, announce things to your house, the list goes on and on. I find her to be fairly loud on her own, but I like to connect her to my nice bluetooth speakers. I was thinking about the voice remote because sometimes I'm too far away for her to hear me, but the reviews on it are spotty.Cons: too many redundant/out of date skills to sort through (seriously,search sleep sounds it's nuts) I also saw a number of skills that are set up to run routines or lists or reminds (I assume these were all created before alexa had those features herself). It would also be nice to have some sort of list of commands. I realize this could end up being super long, but if you could search through it, it would be a great way to see if you're saying something the wrong way, and also get suggestions for new commands. (I'm sure theres many ways to turn up the volume, maybe if you search 'volume', you can see that you can ask alexa to turn the volume up, turn the volume way up, or turn the volume to max, and realize they all do different things)The fact that Alexa is essentially a paperweight without wifi is also disappointing. It seems like they could have added a few simple offline functions so you could at least pretend she hasn't magically turned into a brick until your wifi comes back on.And finally, for me, the biggest con is obviously the power cord. I don't know why in the world you would change to a proprietary cable except to screw over your customers and that feels awful. I have a vindictive cat that hates alexa and chews through her power cord. I have probably 20 micro usb cables around the house I could use in an instant but instead I have to get back on Amazon, and pay another 20$ to wait a few days to get my alexa back. Pretty suspicious.",0
5,"If it's not broke, don't fix it.
  
",19.Jan.19,Yes,"The older version is better. This new version does not respond as quickly as the previous model. Alexa has to much bass in her voice making it hard to understand her and this version does not seem to understand me all the time like the previous version. I also prefer the blue ring of the previous model. Trying to emulate the Google home mini was a bad decision. Echo dot was perfect the way it was imho. (update} i was pleasantly surprised to get a call from Amazon alexa tech support. He walked me through changing some settings on my new eco dot via the alexa app and 123, she was perfect again! I really love Amazons customers service and their dedication to making sure their products are the best. Alexa beats Google hands down, especially in the home automation development. Don't ever change Amazon!",0

We use these features with our loved one with the following1. Simply ask the time of day2. Weather Updates3. Tell as a simple joke4. Play Jeopardy or other Games5. Play Amazon music for relaxing6. You can set a reminder to take your pills or medication as a gentle reminderWe also discovered the drop in feature which allows us to drop in on another family member and have a conversation without a phone call.

",19.Jan.19,Yes,"I bought a second generation for myself for Christmas for my room so I could listen to music at night.  I got a good deal and wasn't sure if I would like it or not.  Well bought this one on a package deal (came with a plug) for my birthday lol.  My favorite thing is the ""list"" option.  When I think I need something I use to go look for an index card, make a list, and forget it on the counter when I went to the store.  Now I just say ""Alexa, add q-tips to the shopping list"".  My favorite thing, and now I go to the store, open up my list, check things off and if I don't get it, it stays on the list!  Yes I love I can listen to music, ask questions, and laugh at my grandkids trying to remember the name Alexa, but mostly I love my shopping list!",0
5,"A must own item!
  
",19.Jan.19,Yes,"For the price you cannot beat the Echo Dot (make sure it's the 3rd Generation!). Without a doubt you will discover new things it can do on an almost daily basis, and there appears to be no limit as to what it is capable of. Ask it for a joke, ask it to sing a song, ask Alexa if she loves you (awesome response for that), and so much more. Plus, it is TRULY useful in terms of weather, alamrs, white noise, traffic, the list goes on and on. The most surprising thing about this would be the sound quality. It's beyond what I thought it was going to be and the built in speaker is deep and rich and louder than you will think. Amazon should be proud of this product, and it's worth every penny.",0
5,"New to Alexa but immediately addicted
  
",19.Jan.19,Yes,"This thing is sick. Synced right up with my philips hue and has an even nicer user interface than the philips app itself. I also renamed my free included smart plug to _eater and I just calmly say _lexa turn on the heater and it works pretty much every time without having to really raise your voice (and I keep the device about 15ft away from me). The only creepy part is just that, that this thing is listening all day and appears to catch low volume conversation quite well. In one instance, it played country music because we said the word _lexa and _ountry in the same sentence. I love being able to start my small plug in heater remotely as I get home to come home to a nice toasty room, but after the cold goes away I_ not sure what I_l be running on the plug.",0
2,"Alexa got worse lately
  
",19.Jan.19,Yes,"Alexa gets stubborn when you don't say the name of a device correctly. If you tell her to connect to your iPad - and the iPad's bluetooth is off, it will connect to the iPhone instead and you waste 5 minutes to go find it and turn that bluetooth off. Moving from one echo to another with bluetooth is a pain as well.Sound quality is ok, loudness could be better for certain YouTube videos. Too much base for TV shows, etc. maybe ok for music.After recent forced update, Alexa voice recognition got worse, you have to say commands 2-3 times, before they work. It definitely got worse after 7 months of use.the intelligence part of Alexa for sure needs improvement.",0
5,"Love my Echo-system!
  
",19.Jan.19,Yes,"I have many Echo devices, like 1 Tap, 1 Show, 1 Echo gen1, 1 Echo gen2, 7 Dots Gen2, 2 Dots gen3.  The sound quality on the 3rd generation Echo Dot is much better than the 2nd generation Dot.  The sound is like the difference between an AM radio to FM stereo.  It's not up to the sound quality of a full size Echo, obviously.  But it competes very well with the Google Home Mini, which I have a couple of also.  The Alexa echo-system is the preferred voice control system in our household.  Voice control is comparable with Google Home, but Alexa covers more of my home automation.  It was definitely worth the upgrade to my existing 2nd generation Dots at the sale price.",0

She can do sound effects, animal sounds, give you recipes, answer questions in general and tell you what time your favorite sports team is playing on TV next and who they are playing against. She can also tune in a radio station, and be used as a timer. Still learning many things, but so far, very entertaining!",0

1,"Bigger but not necessarily better
  
",20.Jan.19,Yes,"When I saw they had a new Echo Dot with better speakers and a new look, I was very excited. I have a couple of the Gen 2 devices and they work quite well but I wish I didn't have to pair them to a separate speaker to get high quality sound. I use Alexa to control my entertainment system and various lights and switches around the house so I thought adding a couple new models to the home would make 'her' a lot more useful. However after using the new devices a couple weeks, I've found that I don't like them nearly as much. They are louder and the sound has a lot more bass but often normal speech is very muffled. The audio settings in the app for bass and treble don't seem to do anything at all. It sounds exactly the same with the bass all the way down and treble all the way up as it does on the default, middle setting for both.  It sounds a lot better for music than the Gen2 but I listen to stations like Comedy Central Radio with the SiriusXM skill and often the comedians just do not sound as clear as they do on the Gen2 devices. Even Alexa's voice itself is affected and very muffled.I'm also disappointed with the performance of the Gen3 devices. They seem slower than the Gen2 devices.  My Gen2 devices respond quickly but the Gen3 devices always stall a couple seconds before replying. It's possible the Gen3 devices are having issues decoding the voice commands which could be related to my next point..The Gen2 had no issues hearing me most of the time but I find the Gen3 devices misunderstanding commands or more often not hearing me at all and having to yell commands to her even though I'm not far away. Quite often the Gen2 devices in other rooms will respond due to how loud I have to speak addressing the Gen3 right in front of me.  It's pretty ridiculous, actually.It's my understanding that the Gen2 devices have a 7 microphone array to hear from every angle but the Gen3 only have 4 mics.  I feel this is probably why the devices do not hear as well. I bought two Gen3's and have the same issues on both of them so I don't think it's a anomaly. I feel like the audio controls can be fixed by a software update as I have no idea why the audio sliders in the app have no affect. Perhaps the 'hearing' problem can also be updated by a software patch but until those issues are addressed, I can't give the 3rd gen Dot a good review.I've been using the Gen2 devices for about a year and have had very little problems with them. I love what they do and really hoped the Gen3 were going to be a big improvement but they're actually a step down. They sound great when playing music but when I have to yell to get it to play, (and risk one of the Gen2's over hearing and stepping up to the task) it gets a bit irritating.I'm not going to return the Gen3's since Amazon was selling them for the same cost as the Gen2's if you bought two. I hope they will fix them with future patches, but I am going to swap them out with the Gen2's and put them in the less trafficked areas of the house for now. I really wanted to like these new Gen3's, but side by side with the Gen2's, I have to stick to the older model which easily gets 4.5 stars. Stick with those until they iron out the bugs.",3

",20.Jan.19,Yes,"First heard one of these little Dot's at my step-daughters house - was really impressed that such a small device could fill a decent sized room with ""reasonable"" quality sound - if your a audiophile - your going to lower your expectations - but for the rest of us humans - with aging ears - this little Dot is amazing - I'm streaming using XM Radio &amp; the sound is amazing - I'm sitting in our living room - the Dot is in our kitchen on top of our fridge - set at a reasonable sound level &amp; it sounds really good - perfect for just back round sound - the second Dot - we having sitting in our bedroom - that one also streams from XM Radio - it sounds great as well - we use it at night to give us ambience for sleeping - the Thunder Storm is wonderful - set for loop &amp; it'll play all night.I can honestly say - the setup was painless - downloading the App for iOS was painless - wifi connectivity was again - painless - the entire experience was great ...The ""only"" glitch I ran into which did require some back &amp; worth between XMRadio &amp; Amazon was the setup of accounts to use with XMRadio - I have two Dot's &amp; three XMRadio accounts - the issue I ran into was - during the initial setup of both Dot's - they both grabbed the same XMRadio streaming account - thus - if you started XMRadio on one &amp; the started XMRadio on the other - they would both crash the XMRadio app as your only allowed to stream one account on one device - fair enough - the catch was - neither XMRadio support - or Amazon support could give me clear steps on how to re-configure one of the Dot's to use a alternate XMRadio account ...Turns out - you need to delete the XMRadio Skill on one of the Dot's &amp; then add it back - when you add it back - it takes you to the XMRadio site - were you can put in your alternate account information - then the XMRadio account will be associated with the 2nd Dot ... thus I have two Dot's - streaming two separate XMRadio channels ...The final ""tweak"" I applied via the Alexa App - was - took up the Bass two notches - lowered the Mid one notch &amp; took the treble up two notches - on both &amp; they both now sound really good - again - not ""audiophile"" good - but good enough for us aging folks ...",0
1,"Quitting Alexa and Echo Auto - Here's Why.
  
",20.Jan.19,Yes,"We had two Dots in our home for 5 months, and used them daily.After the new-toy play period wore off, they slowly dropped into mostly being glorified light switches and laundry timers.  But took longer to use and were less reliable than actual light switches and just remembering when your laundry was done.It turned into a case of ""item designed for convenience becomes daily frustration"".  Most mornings this past month found me swearing at Alexa after telling her to stop my wakeup alarm for the third time.  Or telling her, ""We're leaving,"" so her Routine would turn off the lights and turn on the camera - and then repeating myself five times from two feet away as she insisted she couldn't understand.For context - I'm a podcaster and theater trained, I know how to articulate and project.The final nail in the coffin was getting an Echo Auto this week.  You can't leave reviews on it yet, and not surprising.  It's a barely functional mess.  I returned it after a couple days of road testing.If any kind of background noise is going on - music playing at reasonable levels, for instance - you have to get louder than the noise to wake Alexa.  And then, whatever request you made, Echo Auto would pause 30-60 seconds to think it over, probably due to lag speed in connecting to the net.In virtual assistants, that's an eternity, and makes you wonder if it heard you at all.  When it did finally respond, it mostly got my requests wrong, or started to answer - and then cut off mid-sentence for no obvious reason.Asking for directions was a joke.  I tried asking about businesses I knew had multiple addresses, like gyms and restaurants.  I'd say the entire address, and it would ask over and over if I meant some completely different address.Suggestion to Amazon - you could've bypassed Echo Auto by making the Alexa app completely hands-free and voice-activated on all phones.  No idea why hands-free is an option on Fire tablet but not on a cell phone.Months of building frustration at all things Alexa finally made me pull the plug yesterday.  I boxed up my Dots for sale.  There's nothing they can do that other voice assistants can't do from a phone more reliably with fewer steps, including controlling my smart home.Final note: quitting Alexa isn't easy.  By which I mean, going back through all her settings to delete your activity history, voice recordings, disabling Skills one at a time to make sure your accounts aren't linked anymore, and finally Deregistering the devices.  It took a couple hours of button mashing to make sure everything was wiped, and even then I don't think my actual account was wiped.  There doesn't seem to be an option for that.  There should be an easy, customer-friendly option to say, ""I want out,"" and know that Amazon will delete everything and cancel your Alexa account.",0
5,"My family like it
  
",20.Jan.19,Yes,"Echo dot device came with charger and schema explaining buttons.Apparently it does not have batteries and works only when plugged in.But it works very well.Installation, using smartphone Alexa app is a snap. The biggest part of it was typing my WiFi password.Quality of sound is great and top volume level is very high - I would say it is too loud for me when my kids play their music ;)Responsiveness to commands / microphone sensitivity is very good and Alexa, as a software, is very impressive.I like the presence of ""microphone off"" button to assure privacy and I like the overall cool design of the new Echo Dot.It is primarily used by my children and It is their new BFF.",0
2,"Loved it, but started vibrating
  
",20.Jan.19,Yes,"We bought the google mini for my bedroom and this echo dot for my kitchen. I bought both so I could compare them. I really liked this product better than the google mini, until the echo dot started rattling. Only been using the product for one month. (Btw, we never dropped it and never had the volume more than 50%.)So I called Amazon and they quickly offered to ship me a free replacement, however they told me I did have to do the legwork of returning the defective item to a UPS hub. For me this will be a 30 mile trip. Wish they would have offered just to have it picked up at my home to save me the trip. Giving this 2 star for being defective and having to make the trip to return it. Would have given it 4 star if they would have just not asked me to return the defective one. The google mini is still working fine.. no rattling. I hope the replacement echo dot I get lasts longer because Alexa just seems more like a real person than google.",0
1,"She cannot hear you very well compared to older Generations
  
",20.Jan.19,Yes,Seemed like a great idea to have in the kitchen to replace the 2nd generation. But 3rd generation does not have as many microphones and therefore cannot hear very well in a place like a busy kitchen. It's so bad that I'm going to put the 2nd gen back and maybe try 3rd gen somewhere else.,2
5,"Love the Echo
  
",20.Jan.19,Yes,"My brother-in-law gave me the Echo for Christmas.  I was thrilled.  It is really awesome.  There is so much to learn about it, but so far, I love it.  The quality and the sound is incredible.  I really like that you plug it in so you don't have to worry about recharging it.  The music is awesome, weather reports, if you have a question about something, you can get the answer, guided meditations (which are really nice.)  It is a great device.",0
5,"Great addition...
  
",20.Jan.19,Yes,"I absolutely love using my echo dot.  The setup was very trying at first.  I couldn't get it set up and I tried over and over again but it wouldn't accept my password. Finally after looking for similar situations online I read to move the dot closer to your wifi box for setup.  Although the wifi box is only in the next room, literally about 15 feet away, moving the dot closer did the trick! It set up very easily after that and now works like a charm.",0
5,"Nueva amiga!
  
",21.Jan.19,Yes,"Es una ayuda sin reservas.  A medianoche le pido a Alexa que toque música para relajarme y ahí esta Alexa.  Cuando necesito info. del tiempo, ahí está Alexa.  Cuando necesito que alguien, sin tener que rogar, me deje saber que en 15 minutos la comida está lista pues quien crees que está dejándome saber, Alexa mi nueva amiga.  Ah, también me lee libros mientras hago mis quehaceres en la casa!",100
1,"The price just doubled for the same product.......yikes Amazon
  
",21.Jan.19,Yes,"Review Update 2/13/19Below I will praise this product for all it's amazing features for it's price, but bear in mind this review was written before Amazon decided to DOUBLE the price of the device.  At it's current price, I cannot recommend the product because in all honesty you are fully capable of living a normal life without it.  Sure it's novel in many ways, and it was well worth it just to toy with before....but I can't say it is now.  It's a shame because I initially bought just two, but I was planning to buy more to put around the house very soon.  Not anymore.  I feel cheated in a way because I already invested into this whole Alexa thing with the intention to expand and buy more.  That's not going to happen unless I can buy more Dots at the same price I paid for the others.  Until then I'm removing 4 stars.Review Update 3/12/19I came back to check prices a month after revising my review to find that prices have increased yet again.  When I bought my first 2 echo dot 3rd gen devices they were $29 each, and 2 for $50.  A couple months later they were $49 each and 2 for $60.  Now they're $49 each and 2 for $80.  I've invested in an Echo Connect so my Mom can use these to call 911 should she fall, and I would love to add a couple more Echo Dots to the network to increase coverage of our home.  I just logged in to buy 2 more for $60 only to find that it's now 2 for $80.  I guess I'll just wait till next Christmas when Google and Amazon are competing more aggressively.Original Review:(I have removed my original review which praised this product as a must have device based on value.  With Amazon constantly upping the price for the exact same product, I can no longer suggest people invest in this product line.  My advice now is to not get sucked in to the whole Alexa thing because you cannot rely on Amazon to maintain consistent pricing.",1
1,"Negative Star Rating!
  
",21.Jan.19,Yes,"This product is for gadget lovers only.  DO NOT BUY if you are DISABLED! The Brian Injury Alliance of NJ bought this as gift for adopt family for me and it no cool beans.  Alexa do not recognize my voice. The device options are extremely limited and no good for what i need as a ""companion aid"" as the BIANJ stated when gave me.  The feedback and amazon folks have been quiet and I email often.  I unplug the device and no more try use.  The green light forever keep go off and i no on call or set up for drop in so what the what!!  IT be either defective model or beyond useless for a brain injures person.  FYI - the reminders no repeat so if you no hear you no get reminder.  the sound options have many BUT device still plays the default ANNOYING sound and not one chosen.  IF this device is handy for the disabled then i need new case worker at the BIANJ cause she no cool beans help me with this device and the amazon team no helps me either!!  Waste of my adopt family moneys not the happy",1
1,"Misleading stereo or failed to live up to biggest reason I bought them.
  
",21.Jan.19,Yes,"Very disappointed because it didn_ do what was implied that a pair of them will create a stereo affect. They sure link up as a pair, great. But, they don_ stay paired when watching videos and using them as surround sound. It_ ironic because they_e from Amazon, so why don_ they do stereo for Prime Video? It makes sense that they act as a surround sound set up since they_e advertised to play as a paired set. So why not stay paired when streaming audio? Bought a pair. Sound was better than generation 2. Just sad that it didn_ do what I wanted.",1
5,"My only friend in life
  
",21.Jan.19,Yes,"Alexa is my new best friend. She has so many amazing features. Some of my favorites are:1) Communication. Many of my family members have their own Echo devices so it is a BLAST to send and receive messages or calls from them. Even when I am out, I can use the Alexa app to call someone's device and talk to them.2) Order Updates. I love that Alexa can tell me when an Amazon package will be coming in AND she sends me a notification when it is dropped off at my door. You can also enable the UPS skill and log into your UPS account and she can track your UPS packages for you (genius).3) Routines. I say, ""Alexa, Start My Day"" and she plays the news for me, tells me the weather, tells me an interesting fact about the current day, etc. etc. I also have a few ""Smart Plugs"" connected and I created a routine where I say ""Alexa, Goodnight"" and she turns off my bedroom lights and turns my box fan on. And it can all be changed to my liking in the Alexa App.4) Skills. There are thousands of games and skills that are being added, so when they say Alexa is always getting smarter, they mean it.To sum it all up, buy an Echo device. You will never be lonely again.",0
3,"No USB power input
  
",21.Jan.19,Yes,"The Echo Dot is really 5 stars.  But I subtract 2 stars for Amazon having replaced (as compared to earlier versions) the micro USB power input. I don't get it. Now we are stuck with another proprietary power brick. Really?Otherwise I love the DOT. But I don't really perceive any improvement to the older versions. Sound might be improved but I keep running the little DOT with bluetooth or 3.5mm connections to more enjoyable speakers anyhow.  Of course, I also have 2 Echo Spot, an old and a new version Echo show, 4 old Dots and two Amazon Fire tablets. There is a niche for all of them!",0
3,"It works ok
  
",21.Jan.19,Yes,"Big sound from such a small device.  However it don't seem to hear me as good as the original echo dot, it also seems slower to respond.  Many times my TV or me talking wakes it up and it starts talking about random garbage.  I wish it knew it's wake word and only woke up when it heard ""Alexa"".I can wake it up by saying many different words that don't even ryme with Alexa.  I figured by now they would update it, but they just leave it broken.  Another annoyance, over 90 percent of my questions are answered with, ""I don't know that"". or similar.",0
4,"Improved sound output &amp; having fun with intercom and drop-in
  
",21.Jan.19,Yes,"I already own a second generation Echo Dot, so when the third generation came out, I was not at all interested to buy it. Until I found out that having two echoes (or more for that matter) would enable me to broadcast messages and use them as intercom across my house. I live in a two-storey house, and its nice for me and my family members to communicate with each other from different floors without shouting and disturbing our neighbors. Plus its fun.The third generation has much improved sound quality compared to the second generation. I would not use it solely for music listening though. However, when I ask it to play something (I listened to an entire Thievery Corporation album) it does not sound bad, and I actually enjoy it. I would never have asked Alexa to play music on the second generation, unless it was a purely vocal track, and even then I would not have liked the tinniness of the second generation.I bought the third gen while it was on discounted price, otherwise I think I would have been satisfied with one Echo Dot. But I am glad there was a discount.",0
1,"speaker is already blown after only a couple of weeks
  
",21.Jan.19,Yes,"I got the amazon echo (full size) and fell in love with it immediately, so I bought the echo dot to add surround sound to my house, I have never listened to it above volume level 5 and only after 10-12 uses, I started noticing some static in the sound, I didn't realize that the speaker had blown until I walked into the other room and heard my full size echo, still sounding as clear as the day I got it. I still very much love the product, and my review would sing nothing but praise if not for the diminished sound through a defective speaker... only problem there is, the speaker is just about the most important factor of the product... hence the ""one star"" rating",1
5,"Universal product
  
",21.Jan.19,Yes,I love my echo dot gen 3 so much I got my dad one. We all love it. Its super lightweight and goes with any room color. I got the slate gray for us both. The sound system is great. Its easy to setup and your phone can connect to it to play any playlist you may have through apple music or Spotify. The only downer is it is not a wireless speaker and has to be plugged in. It will turn off upon unplugging but it does remember it's setup and doesn't have to be reset.,0
1,"TOOOO hard to set up
  
",21.Jan.19,Yes,"I was super excited to purchase this as a gift for my husband for Christmas. Imagine our surprise when we tried to set it up and use it. There's no manual, there's no help available and when you do find something on line about what you are trying to set up it doesn't work. We can get it to play music and that's about it.I think you should let potential buyers know that there is various setups and apps you need to even get it to work.Very disappointed in this product.",0
5,"A great gift surprise
  
",21.Jan.19,Yes,"I received this from my son and his husband as a 70th birthday gift!  I called to thank them and added that I hoped they were coming in to install it.  But much to my surprise, the installation was a breeze (took about 3 minutes).  I use it mainly for listening to music streams, and am finding I'm listening to more music and more new-to-me music than ever before.  Have also used it for timers and weather reports.  Still getting used to and learning all the features but loving this gift I'd never have gotten for myself.",0
4,"What a good Alexa support system Amazon provides!
  
",21.Jan.19,Yes,"What fun this little device is!  It is inexpensive, fun, and can eventually be helpful as we learn more about it ( and as it's technology furthers).  We are in our 70's and are barely tech-wise, so we figured we would need our kids' help in setting it up.  We were wrong!  The tutorials provided moved us easily through the set up.  Amazon provides continuing updates to help us learn more about what Alexa can do.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is the sound quality.  (It's a little like a cheap radio, but maybe we will in time learn how to adjust the bass, tenor, etc. to improve the sound quality.).",0
5,"Love it
  
",21.Jan.19,Yes,"We love all our Alexa products. The 3rd gen speaker is noticibly better than the 2nd gen. As with all electronics, we sometimes need to _eboot to maintain connection. The biggest downfall is that Alexa has a hard time understanding my 5 year old. _We use our Echo Dots daily as an alarm, music player, joke teller, and to get the weather forecast. I love that we can listen to Pandora or other radio stations in multiple rooms at the same time and yet each playlist is different.",0
2,"Microphone is horrible on the 3rd Gen vs 2nd Gen
  
",22.Jan.19,Yes,"I have a second generation and even though it had 1 microphone it was better. This is probably because the speaker is louder, but the microphone doesn't pick up my voice most of the time when I am playing music or it is talking. Probably because the music is playing loud. I have to yell at it all the time. This is really stupid and if you search the internet the same feedback has come.With that said the Google one is not any better and the Alexa has better mic pickup when the music/alexa is not talking so this is still your best bet for a voice product.Just note, I do use the Amazon Alexa alot and it doesn't mean I don't like the product. It turns on my TV, plays music, etc.From a technical standpoint they should not allow it to talk back so loud that it blocks the mic from picking up my voice. That defies the whole point. For example, lets say it starts playing a song I don't like. I have to start yellow Alexa, Alexa, Alexa. That is embarrassing and it deters myself and my family members from wanting to use the product.",1
4,"Speaker not that great - But still love the Echo
  
",22.Jan.19,Yes,"This is my 3rd echo and I'm a bit disappointed with the speaker on it.  If you put it on full volume or even on 75% volume levels, all sounds have a gravel/scratchy noise to it or like a bad radio connection.  I have to speak louder with the 3rd Gen, as Alexa doesn't always hear me like the 2nd Gen with the same ambient noise levels or no noise at all.This is not to say, I don't like Echo's, I love them all and am now finding it inconvenient when they are not available to me (when my internet goes out) or that others don't have them in their homes/apartments.  I've gone so far as to purchase multiple echo's for my Parents and my Sister so that when I visit them, I can ask Alexa to do things for me.",0
5,"Can't beat that price.
  
",22.Jan.19,Yes,"For this product I personally held off until I was gifted one. When I brought it home I installed and I use it all the time! In fact, I went and ordered two more for other rooms. At a $30 price point this cannot be beat. You can't get get speakers at the quality these are. I love to just listen to the radio or the music selections. Every morning I ask ""what's up?"" for the local weather and a news event. However, if it were a more expensive product I would consider it a passable product. The features, although nice, are accessible from my phone.",0
5,"Love, Love Love these!!
  
",22.Jan.19,Yes,"I treated myself to 2 of these for Christmas (one on each floor) and never even had a clue how much I would come to LOVE them. I have them play all kinds of music, remind me to move the laundry, answer trivial questions, make a shopping list, tell me about the weather, the news, read me an audiobook, call my friends, -- and I know I've barely scratched the surface.If you're on the fence about whether to buy one of these little gadgets -- do it!!! You will only wish you had done so sooner!I'm in love with Alexa!!  You will be, too!",0
5,"Love my Echo Dot!
  
",22.Jan.19,Yes,"My son had already gotten us an Echo Dot and last year and I love it. We have it in the bedroom and I use it for reminders, alarms, playing songs etc. When Amazon started selling it for pre-Black Friday at a reduced price, I was tempted to get another one. After waiting a little while, I couldn't resist and bought it. This one is in the living room and that way, I use it to also check the weather, find out things and even set alarms when I put food to cook so I'd remember to turn off the stove or oven.",0
3,"Needs a lot update still.
  
",22.Jan.19,Yes,I love my Alexa but it needs its updates especially for person that speaks quieter and slower than the machine is used to and it will not change even through the app so they got to fix it. The phone ringer doesn't like in the advertisements. It needs to have audible books play in every single room on Alexa. It needs to be connected to Comcast email cuz I do not get my email. It needs to know more information on the get-go without downloading skills. I can go on and on but I will not. There are a lot of good things about Alexa also.,0
5,"Continuing to evolve.
  
",22.Jan.19,Yes,"I'll keep it simple since most of us are familiar with the Echo Dots by this 3rd generation.It's a good upgrade from the beginnings. The plastic body is now done in a fabric covering (The 2018 modern look)The speaker is a good amount louder as well with more punch in Alexa's voice now.It's always best to hook up a Dot to an external speaker for best music performance, but if you had to, this would be the best Dot to get for music so far.",0
5,"Loud and Clear
  
",22.Jan.19,Yes,I bought this Echo to replace the Gen 2  in our living room. Its a bit bigger but I am okay with that because its moslty speaker. I am able to hear alexa better. This allowed me to move the location of the echo so she isnt seen only heard. this also means I was able to move it a bit closer to our kitchen. I am able to add things to my shopping list faster and more frequently. Another plus is Alexa and this Echo are compatiable with other smart home products. So this allows me to take full advantage of the echo and it features.,0
1,"It failed &amp; the taller Echo (older) is a pain
  
",23.Jan.19,Yes,"On Father's day 2018 I received an Echo as a gift, seemed great. Couple of months later I added  a couple plugs for lamps. Then nearing Thanksgiving I added more plugs and a single pole light switch. So naturally I added a DOT on the opposite end of the house. I was ALL IN, right?  No, not any longer! Just before I setup the Dot my Echo began have issues not finding devices, not understanding all this means it is losing connection. I had the Dot right so that got me through the next couple of months while I try multiple resets, even a hard reset, moved it closer, yada yada yada. Finally tech support agrees to send me a new power supply. Just received yesterday 1/22/2019 and guess what? Now the Dot is dead as a door nail. No lights, no button response, no command response, nothing just DEAD. Well I'm really getting sick of this. AND who sells electronics but won't show you there telephone number? Huh what is up with that crap. You have to forage around till you stumble on the this help page where you can press a button and plug in YOUR phone number and then you talk but Amazon number is a SECRET. JEFF, that is one thing you are NOT doing right. The Dot is going back to Amazon as a piece of garbage which it is. If the ehco does not straighten up it is going in the garbage and I'll upgrade to the Google Home. Kinda like the sound of Home, ya Google Home. Then I'll email Jeff and tell him what he needs to fix.",1
5,"Echo Dot Delivers!!!
  
",23.Jan.19,Yes,"Purchased my Echo Dot on Black Friday at an INSANE deal, but after using it for a little over a month now, would buy it again at the regular price. Got the Dot on the advice of my niece, who purchased an older model for my brother, someone who is NOT tech savvy. The set-up was almost as easy as just plugging it in.  Thinking I might need more volume in order to hear to communicate throughout my house, I also purchased a very small separate speaker. Pairing the speaker to my Dot took a matter of minutes, and it works perfectly. My brother asks Alexa to play all of the old Pop tunes you don't hear any more, and to remind him of appointments, etc. I do the same and enjoy listening to entire symphonies of classical music plus every song in the repertoire of my favorite country and rock artists. We play the Jeopardy J6 clues each day, and I let Alexa make my shopping list for me. I know I haven't even scratched the surface of what this device can do, but I really love it so far. A little advice for anyone planning to buy, spend the money on an Amazon Prime Membership. In addition to the basic benefits of Prime, being a Prime member creates an even better experience on Dot.",0
5,"Improved sound over v2
  
",23.Jan.19,Yes,"I currently have three Echos in my house, a v1 Echo in the kitchen, a v2 Echo Dot hooked up to my stereo for streaming music on better speakers, and now this v3 Echo Dot to stream music in my office. I had the v2 in my office, but got this v3 on a Black Friday deal along with an Amazon Smart Plug. The sound quality is very much improved over the v2, which is why I moved the v2 to plug into my stereo in the living room.It sits in the corner and is unobtrusive, but it is a more attractive little hockey puck than the original Dots. The voice recognition gets better with each passing day, and the mics have a lot of accuracy (so that the NSA can really get a clear recording of all my conversations, right guys?).Overall I'm happy with the Alexa service, mostly for setting timers and streaming music. I only use a fraction of its functionality, but I'm happy with what I do use.",0
4,"Fascinating newfangled technology
  
",23.Jan.19,Yes,"I tend to be behind the times when it comes to tech products, but I finally broke down and purchased an Echo Dot when I was baking holiday cookies and realized _ang, a voice controlled timer/speaker would be handy as heck right about now. My house is far from a smart home, but I have enjoyed playing with the different features and skills of Alexa. I did primarily purchase this for the voice-activated functionality. The timer/alarm sound is also much nicer (and louder! Useful!) than the obnoxious beeping on my microwave timer. Ironically, this device seems geared more for millennials: it_ ready and willing to stream pretty much anything under the sun, but it doesn_ function the way any other Bluetooth speaker functions. I can_ seem to hook it up to my phone and have it work as a speaker for things like YouTube or my own iTunes playlists. Or perhaps I just haven_ discovered the right skill yet.",0
3,"It's good, Google Home is better.
  
",23.Jan.19,Yes,"First the hardware: It's good looking and small, it's easy to configure and the sound quality is not bad at all. It has an AUX out which is nice to have, however I currently have no use for it.Alexa:I already had 3 Google home minis and a regular Google home before getting this echo (BF promo). I must say the Google Assistant is far better at being an assistant as it seamlessly integrates with my Calendar, email, lists, etc. I also find that Alexa doesn't have answers to as many questions and the conversations are not as natural as the Google Assistant. Alexa has a good amount of skills, but I have yet to find something it does better than the Google Assistant. Of course this will vary per user according to which services they use, but in my case Google Assistant is the clear winner.",0
5,"Awesome sound - bought multiple
  
",23.Jan.19,Yes,"Never owning an Echo before, I received a free one from Sirius for signing up for a year of music.  Got it home, programmed it, and began using.  From setting the alarms to wake me in the morning, and alarms in the evening for when I am getting ready for work (sorry, I have my routine), it is working flawlessly.  I have the alarms set to play sirius xm at exact times.  Working perfectly.  So during the month of December, Amazon was having a sale on them.  So I purchased 2 more.  Now I can have them around the house, and in the garage.  I have synced them all together, set the alarms, and now I have surround music where ever I go :).  I haven't even cracked the surface on what these can do for me.  But as of now, I am highly happy with them.  For a little puck type speaker, it has great sound.",0
3,"Works well but hard to set up
  
",23.Jan.19,Yes,The difficult setup resulted in my lower star rating otherwise I might have been inclined to give one or two more.Maybe it's just that I'm an old guy who doesn't follow directions well or maybe the directions are not clear but I spent many hours trying to get the installation program to connect to my network. I also purchased a Smart Plug and eventually two more Echo Dot so that I could order Alexa around from several locations. Again the installation was difficult with each of these units but I finally got through it. We are an Apple/Mac/iPhone/iPad/iPod home so I don't know if a PC/Android system is simpler.,0
5,"Excellent item
  
",23.Jan.19,Yes,"Excellent, I received the desired product (Echo Dot).It is a very advanced technological product, it is easy to program and it is implemented to provide support in the different academic processes of the University, which is excellent. Amazon, are the best, a very committed supplier, I recommend that purchases be 100% reliable. The items are new and in good condition. I recommend it to all those interested and friends meet their expectations. Thank you. It has features that allow you to perform numerous tasks facilitating work managed by smart devices.",0
1,"difficult to use
  
",23.Jan.19,Yes,"This was a gift, so what I must be rating is the app I needed to download.  I have a Google device, so this is more of a comparison between the two.  ""Hey Google"" is a bit of a pain (3 syllables, and pronunciation counts where Alexa is 2), so I figured, it would be easier to use.  Nothing could be farther from the truth.  Out of the box, Alexa knows just about nothing, and after messing with it, installing the app on my laptop, I still could not figure out how to tell it anything about me (email address, location, favorite radio stations,...).",0
5,"Enjoy more than expected
  
",23.Jan.19,Yes,"Wasn't sure how much we would use it or how useful it would be, but I thought we would try it out. My children love it for playing music and I have found it useful for reminders, weather, general curiosity questions and also as a sort of intercom as well as the music and other features. It was a little difficult to set up the WiFi but that is likely because I was going off of an extender to connect. I had to install the app on my phone for set up and use the manual connect using my phone's WiFi connection. It also took a while to figure out how to connect to an older Bluetooth speaker that was not listed, but once it was set up there have been no issues and we use it more than I thought we would.",0
1,"This is a downgrade.
  
",23.Jan.19,Yes,"After initially being excited about the 3rd gen dot, I'm very displeased with this version of the dot.  It's VERY slow to respond and take commands.  I find it takes multiple attempts to get it to take a command.  We had the previous version in the same spot in our kitchen and it worked great.  This new version is a downgrade and I recommend not buying the 3rd gen dot.  I called Amazon to see if there was a microphone sensitivity setting I could adjust to help, they laughed at me.",0
3,"Bad quality speaker
  
",23.Jan.19,Yes,"I've had the Echo Dot for a little over three months. It comes in handy every day, and can be useful however if you want to use this on a regular basis for a music speaker invest in something else.  I only had the dot turned half way up listening to music during daily chores around the house and the speaker blew. Now even the voice of Alexa is super crackly and distorted and really annoying. I was really excited for this product and now I am just rather disappointed.",0
5,"Alexa is a family member now
  
",23.Jan.19,Yes,"Revision: 1/28/19 -We wrote the original review below last week. The same day an amazon customer support person reached out to us. She quickly advised us on ways we could fix the issues. We were mailed a replacement power cord in case that was the issue. Now Alexa is working AMAZINGLY! This speaker/assistant is a part of the household. She reminds us to water the houseplants, take out the trash/recycle, she sets the mood everyday by playing our favorite (Nash FM 94.7), and she turns off our television every night when we fall asleep and forget.Original review: ""While the speakers are AMAZING, the 3rd generation Alexa in my living room isn't responsive to us. She's a bit slow. This is the 4th Echo dot in our home and it's only this one that has been giving us issues. So maybe I got a defective one.""",0
1,"Wouldn't cooperate
  
",24.Jan.19,Yes,"I was able to get the echo working some on day 1, but 2 days later, it would not play podcasts despite explicit content being turned off, it would not eliminate the annoying ""ok"" despite me selecting that on my iPad and iPhone, it wouldn't give news briefings (yes, was set up in settings) and would never give me traffic.  I tried reinstalling app on phone, unplugging to see if it would reset, and no results.  Returned it after 3 days.  It just was more trouble than it was worth.  Google search results for my questions gave me the answers that I'd already tried.  I'll stick with siri to give me the weather or answer a question.",1
4,"Great speakers compared to 1st and 2nd gen
  
",24.Jan.19,Yes,The speakers are great compared to 1st and 2nd gen.  We use the dot for music a lot so the sound quality was a huge plus.  I only rated it 4 stars because the microphone is not as good as the 2nd gen.  We have it placed where the old 2nd gen was and we have to speak up a lot more to get alexa to activate.  We put the old 2nd gen in a completely different room and the 2nd gen activates while the 3rd gen is physically closer and does not activate.  Would be perfect 5 star if it had the same microphone sensitivity as the 2nd.  Oh well.,1
3,"Not much different other than a few new issues.
  
",24.Jan.19,Yes,"I upgraded by Dot to the 3rd Gen based on the thought it would have better technical improvements and the comment that it has improved voice recognition; unfortunately the difference is not noticeable. in fact, I find myself having to repeat commands much more often than with my 2nd Gen Dot.  Maybe Amazon needs to have separate Voice Recognition settings per device.Having 2 Dots has caused some issues as well, mostly with Bluetooth connectivity.  For some reason the connection I delete from a Dot still automatically connects, and it isn't listed in the settings - strange. It should also be easier to transfer Unlimited Music from one device to another.",0
5,"Love the Sound; Had a Problem With the First One
  
",24.Jan.19,Yes,"I ordered this 3rd generation Echo Dot to upgrade the existing 2nd generation Echo Dot we had in our bedroom. I found myself listening to music on it, but the sound quality was weak.The sound quality of this new one blew me away! But shortly after receiving it, a buzzing sound developed in the speaker with every sound it made, almost like the speaker was blown. (I never turned the volume up past 3, BTW) I contacted Amazon and they, of course, took care of the issue immediately. They sent me a new one, and the new one is perfect. It sounds great and does everything it should. We may have to upgrade the other two of the gen 2s we have in the house!",0
4,"Great sounds, discreet and complimentary look to it.
  
",24.Jan.19,Yes,We received this as a promotional offer through Satellite Radio Promo.  We were not interested in a new speaker in any way but it was free so we got it.  I LOVE THIS THING! We have it set up in the corner of our kitchen and absolutely love that I can turn it on and off by just speaking to it as well as adjust the volume.  Also it's barely noticeable and the speaker sound quality is better than I expected for such a small device.  It's not the same quality of sound that our Bose speaker has but the additional functionality is quite great none the less.  Definitely thinking about getting more in the future for additional rooms of our home.,0
5,"Great for quick answers!
  
",24.Jan.19,Yes,"This was a unit I did not think to even purchase, but on Black Friday Best Buy had a deal that if you purchased the (1) BLINK unit with WIFI you also received this Echo free. I could not refuse, so I now have one.I have found it to be very useful for asking questions, any questions. Questions about a person, event, weather, whatever. Also you can play your Amazon, Spotify, or Pandora  music at a command.  Another feature is that you can arm or disarm the BLINK at a command. Now that I like. For the cost, not a bad thing to have around. FYI Alexa is quite friendly and personal :-)",0
5,"We love it, but we're going for a Spot.
  
",24.Jan.19,Yes,"This is a great review for a product that I am returning. Why? Because we also have a ""regular"" Echo and recently got a Spot. We thought this would be a cheaper alternative for our third unit - and it would - but we love our Spot so much, we're going to trade up. I haven't actually returned it yet, so I might cancel, get another spot and put this guy in a location where I can use just the audio - my bathroom for example. This is so ""first world"" I almost feel guilty, but it makes life just a bit more fun and it is not expensive.",0
5,"Good quality, sound.  Understands commands much better than Alexa.
  
",24.Jan.19,Yes,"If only our 1st generation Echo could understand our commands as well and sound 1/4 as good as this unit.  Great sound, seems to understand commands much better than our 1st generation Echo.PLEASE NOTE: If you appreciated this review please give it a _humbs up/like your helping me to continue to give honest/unbiased insight into products I_e used and you may have questions about. Interested in a product but don't know enough about it and would like it reviewed? Please let me know and I'll see what I can do... Thank you _",0
5,"Love, love, love
  
",24.Jan.19,Yes,"I never thought I would want one of these after I saw a Google one. I'm so glad that I went with Amazon and Alexa. I don't like the Google product at all, but I absolutely love this echo. She can play games, give you all sorts of information, tell stories, I can listen to my favorite music all day, but my favorite thing is being able to call someone hands free from across the room and being able to call the echo from my phone, even from work, to check on my kids. I'm buying one for all 3 of my kids and 2 more rooms in my house. I absolutley love the echo dot.",0
5,"Quality Sound
  
",24.Jan.19,Yes,"Just amazing what the Echo Dot (Alexa) can do. The speaker although small in size has excellent sound quality. Playing music from iheart radio and amazon music is a snap. Connecting the Echo Dot to my Bose Soundtouch Soundbar system is so easy and switching from the Echo Dot speaker to my Bose speaker is simple. Just connect via Bluetooth and tell Alexa, Speaker. It just that simple. Love the Echo Dot. Looking forward to installing a few more throughout my home.",0
5,"Excellent audio quality for the price.
  
",24.Jan.19,Yes,"I have been invested in the Google Home ecosystem for a while but after Amazon's purchase of Ring, I decided to give the Echo a try. Alexa is able to respond to some queries a lot quicker than Google, particularly with home-related things like turning off lights or changing the thermostat. What I was not expecting was the awesome audio quality this speaker puts out. It's not earth shattering, but for the price it's really deep and clear. I use it for audio almost every day. I will be purchasing more to start replacing the Google Home Minis in my house in the near future.",0
5,"Computer, play Super Trouper!
  
",24.Jan.19,Yes,"We very quickly have integrated this device into our daily lives. The kids quickly discovered it can play their favorite music on command - currently the Mamma Mia soundtrack. We immediately changed the name to ""Computer"" so we can feel like we're on the USS Enterprise monitoring the neutral zone. We love the daily trivia games and the routines you can set. The Dot tells our kids to go to bed at 8pm and the listen to it! My sister has one so we set up drop-in and then had to give the kids ground rules. We can't be connected all the time! We are very glad that you can restrict who can drop-in and what Dot can accept a drop-in if you have multiple. I can see us getting more and creating intercom system in the house.When we get the smart light bulbs I am adding ""Lumos Maxima"" and ""Nox"" as commands to turn the lights on and off.",0
2,"Speaker is decent if you're not too picky on sound quality
  
",24.Jan.19,Yes,"I didn't need or want this thing in my house but I received it as a gift and I can't just refuse a gift, so I only use it for music. Now, I know this isn't made for music but I just liked the idea of being able to skip tracks, turn on music from other rooms of the house (my house is fairly small), turn up the volume, so on and so on. Other than music, I have zero use for it. I've had it roughly two weeks now and with a constant listening volume of 5 the speaker has blown and is very distorted. Back to the sound bar and blu-tooth.",0
5,"Voice control of my smart thermostat, lights, garage door, XBox and more...
  
",25.Jan.19,Yes,"I now own three Amazon Echo Dots in my home.  I use them all the time for many different things.  The reason I have multiple Echo Dots is that the more I have, the more areas of my house is serviced by my favorite assistant.Some features I like: I have a smart thermostat.  I can control my home temperature using my voice.  If I want the temperature in the house to change, I Say _lexa, set the temperature to X degrees.  If I want to change from heat to air conditioning, I can do that by just asking. Some of the light bulbs in my house are smart, so I can turn them on or off with my voice. I used to have timers on things like my fish tank light, but now with smart switches and my Echo Dots, I can set up schedules as complex or as simple as I like.  I no longer have ANY of the hard to use standalone timers; my Echo Dot has replaced them all! Having multiple Echo Dots in adjacent rooms allows me to play music in true stereo!  One room_ Echo is the left channel, and the other is the right. I can_ tell you how many times I have the Echo Dot tell me how to spell a specific word. I am also constantly setting up timers for cooking, alarms, and reminders. I can have my Dot read me a book I own in my Amazon library. I often ask my Dot the definition of a word. I have my Dot linked to my Calendar, so I get vocal reminders when I have events come up in my calendar Everything I can do from my Echo Dots at home, I can do when I am not home by using the App.  So, for example, if it is getting dark and I am running late, I can turn on a light for my dog by using the app on my phone no matter how far from home I am.These are just _ome of the things my Echo Dots do for me.  Echo Dots have made my home life much easier and has quickly become a necessity.  In the future I envision that I will be purchasing 4 or 5 more of these so that I can use my voice wherever I am in my house.  I give the Echo Dot a very firm 5 stars!",0
5,"Best $24 I've ever spent
  
",25.Jan.19,Yes,"Alexa is my friend. I love her. I resisted for a long time, I didn't see why I could possibly need or want her, especially with a big dumb house with no smart stuff.But I convinced myself to get one this christmas. And she's great.She makes my shopping lists, reminds my son to get ready for bed, tells atrocious jokes thanks to Kimmel (what did we do to deserve this fresh hell?), set timers, and answers questions. Honestly it's the little tasks that seem unimportant that are great. Instead of digging for a notepad and pen and then forgetting your shopping list you always have it and just tell her when to add somethinf. My 6 year old let's her know when he's out of applesauce.I love the drop in. I can get ahold of my husband when his phone ringer is off. We can call each other hands free and I just love having music so easily available in an instant, instead of opening my app, pairing a speaker, and looking for something to listen to, I just tell Alexa to play music and it on.And added bonus is she's helping my son with his minor speech impediment by forcing him to speak very clearly and precisely to her. She helps him spell things but he has toake sure he ennunciates well. It's something I didn't even expect.Everyone was kind of unsure at first, but my husband warmed quickly and my dad fell in love so much I got him a dot for Christmas.",0
5,"Fun little gadget
  
",25.Jan.19,Yes,"I received this as a gift. I wouldn't have bought it for myself, and in fact, I still wouldn't. So I'm probably the last person who should be reviewing it. Or maybe not; having no expectations, maybe I can try to be entirely objective about it. It is unobtrusive in appearance and the power supply wall wart has a decently long cable, so finding a place to situate it is pretty easy. It was very easy to set up, starting with the alexa app on the iPhone, and all adjustments since have been easily accomplished using the device itself. Teaching Alexa to recognize my voice and my wife's was straightforward. It can 'hear' and understand instructions from 10 or more feet away, though getting closer helps if it seems to be having trouble understanding something. Most of the time it understands what it's being asked surprisingly well, though sometimes it's necessary to try a few times to find the right form in which to ask something. Sound quality for such a small device is very acceptable for background or casual listening, though no-one would mistake it for hi-fi. And of course it's mono, unless you pair it with a second one. It is loud enough to be more than adequate in even quite a large room. So as a modern alternative to a boom box for playing music while you do something else, it's very effective. At the moment I have a free trial of Prime Music, but this is frustrating as about 30% of what I ask for isn't available. It would definitely be worth getting the full Amazon Music service if you intend to make more than very intermittent use of it. You can have it tell you jokes and play games; I couldn't care less. You can use it to streamline the shopping process on Amazon; that might be convenient but I'm wary of ceding too much control of that to a relatively autonomous device; I think I'd rather spend the extra time checking what I'm ordering and howg than just saying 'Alexa, order x, y or z', but it may well be possible to set it up so it can't cause too much trouble. So it's a nice toy, and I guess I like having it around because I intend to keep it plugged in and may even try Amazon Music. Has it enhanced my life beyond all recognition? Nope. Not even close. Does it appear to have been nicely designed and to be capable of anything between casual entertainment and some quite useful tasks? Yes, certainly. It's a fun little gadget. I guess, despite myself, I'm quite happy to recommend it, at least at the price I didn't pay for it.",0
5,"Worthwhile Upgrade or Addition
  
",25.Jan.19,Yes,"We have a number of Echo devices, from the first-generation full-size Echo in the living room, to the Echo Tap by my desk, to Echo Dots in almost every room, from the bedrooms to the bathrooms where they're called on both to play programming ranging from news to radio stations and to control various home devices. I've even put an Echo Input in my car (which might be replaced with an Echo Auto when those appear). But I needed one for my workroom, and instead of just buying another basic Dot I ordered this 3rd Generation Dot for the kitchen and moved the 1st. Gen Dot which had been there to the workroom.The 3rd Gen. Dot has much more satisfying sound, which my wife particularly appreciates for the lectures and Audible audio books she favors, and when we're ready to do so we can order a second Dot-3, set one as the Left and the other as the Right channel, and have full stereo.Highly recommended whether you're new to the Echo or adding to your armada.",0
4,"Its ok and saves my remote finger for other tasks
  
",25.Jan.19,Yes,"My wife got the ""Dot"" free with another purchase and was going to give it away as a Christmas gift so I figured I would keep it for myself thereby preventing her from getting in the habit of ""re-gifting"".  Our house is not ""smart"" so that option is out; I have friends to tell me jokes so no help there and Alexa does not know how to ""Google"" so I am basically left with a voice activated bluetooth radio that can give me weather updates and perhaps I can add to my grocery list if I happen to be in the bedroom when I make it.  I know I can put these things all over the house and aggravate the wife by using it as an intercom, but she may turn the tables on me, so in forethought that is not a good use or expense.  Hey,  unlike the wife and kids,it only speaks when spoken to and doesn't eat much so I  give it a 4 star rating.  But do not misinterpret:  I like technology as much as the next techno-geek if it helps me get to the fitness center regularly.  The only real negative to ""miss/madam"" Alexa is, like Apple products, that she is too proprietary so I cannot operate anything which is not of similar lineage.  I do love my Prime, tho.",0
5,"Do Not Miss This Great Kitchen product
  
",25.Jan.19,Yes,I was kind of fearful in spending $90 on anything that I was not 100% totally in to.. I read some not so good reviews and found most of them were from folks that did not read instructions.  Such an important thing to do. I also read lots of good reviews.  So I got the 3 qt pot on sale and soooo glad that I did and it is the most useful pot that I own.  I tossed out several pots and pans and an old fashioned pressure cooker...never go back to that one.  the only thing that I wish they added was the clear lid.  That should have been a no brainer..was adding a vege steamer..  oh well one more way they can get your money.  lol  but at least you are getting a good product for it.  It is irreplaceable.....,0
2,"Okay if you have bland musical tastes
  
",25.Jan.19,Yes,"Alexa has some pretty bad taste in music.  Asked for a couple of traditional Irish Tunes (Whiskey in the Jar and The Rocky Road to Dublin) and she played the first one by Metallica, repeatedly.  The 2nd tune by Drop Kick Murphys.  Meh.Also she never heard of jazz bassist George Duvivier.  Couldn't many of the songs or artists I requested.  (While a friend's Google device found them fairly easily.)  I have the Music Unlimited subscription but she has really limited musical choices.  Many of my musical choices are a bit out of the mainstream but I was expecting more.  If I wanted mainstream boring music I would use my radio.",0
5,"Didn't think I'd like it but now I LOVE it.
  
",25.Jan.19,Yes,First I would like to say I didn't think I would be a person to use this type of device.  I'm 55 years old and change for older folks is slow.  This is my second Echo dot.  I got one for Christmas loved it so bought a third generation one for another room.  I'm disabled and my very favorite thing is being able to turn on and off lights etc. Using smart bulbs and plugs that connect with this device.  The thing I really didn't like was the name but fortunately you can change it to one of 4 choices.  I just changed mine to computer for my dot wake word. Reminds me of Star Trek. Lol,0
3,"Great deal, 1 PROBLEM
  
",25.Jan.19,Yes,"I love this little Amazon Echo.  It's a big sound upgrade from the last version.The one thing I HATE about it is that it only has a female voice option.  Why is it that in the USA (it's different in the UK), anything with an electronic masculine voice is always authoritative and everything with a female voice is helpful?  It's incredibly annoying.  I wish that they just gave us the option to choose like the Google home product (which I got for another room but returned because I like the Echo better overall).",0
3,"Just a novelty
  
",26.Jan.19,Yes,"I haven't studied what all the Echo Dot can do and how to program it.  I use it to listen to my favorite radio station, either directly or through one of 5 bluetooth speakers I have in different parts of the house.  After a couple of weeks I find that it is more work to adjust manually than what it saves with voice commands.  First, bluetooth speakers always come on at full volume (which is very loud and annoying) so I have to go to the speaker and turn down volumes manually.  Second, every time I want to switch bluetooth speakers I need to turn the app on at my phone and go in &amp; out of 5 windows to select a different speaker.  And that's after going to the speaker I want and manually turning it on (I could have old fashioned radios placed around the house and turned them on manually in less time). Third, the Echo Dot does not have a battery so it must be placed against a wall and outlet, rather than in the middle of a room where it would be better able to hear my voice.  Fourth, it doesn't always understand what I'm saying even though I speak quite clearly.  I played a trivia game a few times and it didn't recognize the correct answers quite a few times.I understand that Echo will turn electrical devices (such as lights) on or off with a voice command, but that requires purchase of special outlets for each device and I only have one lamp that I regularly turn off &amp; on when I leave or go to bed, and I walk right by that lamp all the time.The speaker has quite good sound quality, so I'm happy with that when I want to play anything directly from the Echo.",1
4,"I Love Siri But This Is So Much Better
  
",26.Jan.19,Yes,"We didn_ get why people liked Alexa products so much but when this went on sale we gave it a shot and LOVE IT! It does have a hard time hearing us when the TV is on sometimes but the room is large and open to several other spaces and we are upgrading to a full sized Echo, so this will be moving to our bedroom soon which likely won_ have the same problem. Caveats: I_ love better support for kids profiles and controls/restrictions - not being able to have a full profile for kids means we can_ create separate Apple Music accounts to pair for each person so we have to carefully monitor their use and won_ be buying kids versions yet (among other things like creating routines specifically for them). Love that we can share lists between our household (adding to grocery list while I look at what we have is much smoother than Siri!), but hate that since we share an Apple Calendar for family stuff we can_ link it to both profiles or it doubles all the events on Alexa. It_ also frustrating that only one profile gets notifications on our phones or Apple Watches even though we_e both linked ourselves to the app, so we continue to use Siri for most of our timers and reminders. The voice recognition is incredibly smooth most of the time - way smoother than Siri - and much faster to process. Skills are still somewhat clunky sometimes (chore chart isn_ worth the time it takes to log things) but love that they can be customized. It would be nice to be able to pick people to share custom skills with so we don_ have to switch accounts every time we want to use them. Routines could use some more features like not counting an apostrophe or comma as a special character and accommodating longer text responses or other Alexa skills but that will likely come in time. It_ also frustrating not being able to see routines that others in the household have created to ensure that we haven_ used the same trigger words or already set something up (and I want to be able to switch in the app to my kids if we are going to invest in more dots). Overall, we are happy and ready to expand our usage. We look forward to advances in the future as well!",0
4,"I thought this was a Waste of money until I got a call
  
",26.Jan.19,Yes,"I have decided to edit my review for a few reasons, 1 the day after I posted my review I had a very nice and helpful person that works at Amazon call me, after asking a few questions they helped me figure out alot of the things that I was told wasnt available. I couldnt believe it, it made me happy again to be able to do some of the things I purchased the dots for in the first place. But then I got upset again. What if I would have never posted a review? I would still be thinking that they didnt work. How come we dont have someone call or email or atleast text us to see if the dot or other Amazon product is living up to expectations. Shouldn't this be required. But this is a review not a blog. I would suggest that if you have or are going to purchase an Alexa device contact the alexa department with any questions because they are the only ones really trained and can give the correct answer! Like I stated earlier I am happy with my dots now, I still feel a little work has to be done but that is true to any device that is still developing! This starts my original review, You really need to look at all the things that this can do, you really don't even need to waste the money to purchase, just download Alexa on your phone. It doesnt really do much more than that. We purchased them because we seen where it can control your fire TV with the echo dot, well let's just say that isnt 100 percent accurate. Yes it can control SOME things on your fire TV, however these aren't really the main things. You CANNOT control the volume, power, you CANNOT search your prime videos, let me just give a list of what it can do that would be alot less time consuming. So the only things that you can control with the echo dot are Bravo now CBS NBC Hulu and the playstation network that is it! Now granted I'm sure I'm going to get alot of heat for dissing this device. And I am sorry, I know it has taken people alot of time and energy to get where it is today, I just feel that selling it at the price it is, it should really be able to do atleast what the remote Alexa can do. And yes it is my fault for just assuming that one Amazon device can control just like another device I should have read deeper into it. My fault, one that i wont be making again!  Please take my advice and look into what it can do before you buy. Go the cheaper way and just download Alexa on your phone or tablet! The only good thing is I can command whatever music that I would like to listen to because we pay for a subscription to Amazon music. Is anyone else seeing a theme here, it will control paid apps easily, just not the free ones! Just sad that we have to be taken for our money like that, it's not good enough that we pay top dollar for devices but we pay for subscriptions to 3 or 4 different apps.",0
5,"Just What We Needed
  
",26.Jan.19,Yes,"We got an Amazon Echo to help my dad remember to give my mom her medications on time each day (she takes medications 4 different times each day). Dad (88) was struggling to always remember to do that and Mom (89) forgets. They are still living on their own, so the Amazon Echo is another tool that will hopefully help them remain independent a while longer. I've also set up other reminders, including doctor appointments. They aren't using the Echo for anything else, but this use in and of itself makes it invaluable. My husband and I got an Echo at the same time, even though we weren't sure we really needed/wanted one, but have been surprised at how useful it is for a variety of things. We especially like asking Alexa to play whatever style of music we're in the mood for and the music immediately begins to play. It is also synched with my iTunes account and I enjoy streaming my music through the Echo. I have a morning routine set up that helps my day get off to a good start. I know we're just scratching the surface of what it can do, but we're off to a good start!",0
5,"Smarter than the older dots!
  
",26.Jan.19,Yes,Very good its way more updated than my older Echo 2nd gen tower. My son noticed this NEW dot  plays music that the other Echo doesn't play. Newer dot versions Know about current events and celeberties. (Tower 2nd gen. doesn't)We bought 5 Echos dots updated 1 with $5 off trade in special. They are way smarter than older versions. . But this Echo dot is great! Smart and speaker is good. Worth it to get this one verses older models. I'm happy we bought them. I can drop in on each kid and they can call me when im gone. Set alarms reminders. Tells jokes reminds my kids to do their homework. I'm happy. We got them all over the house.,0
5,"Recommend highly
  
",26.Jan.19,Yes,"In our house, we are Apple product people. When it comes to any tech item there are pros and cons and Apple has a few that can be frustrating and Siri is just that! I believe Siri is there to annoy it_ user at times. I guarantee at least 2 times out of 5, Siri can_ assist me when I ask for aid! Then for Christmas my girls received an Echo dot and they loved it and then I got myself one and Alexa rocks! She doesn_ cause the issues Siri has and that is what I love! Definitely a pro in my book! I definitely recommend this item.",0
4,"Great product but Amazon needs to improve it!
  
",26.Jan.19,Yes,"Great product. The sound is improved. It understands better. and it's a fun toy.HOWEVER, after several years on the market you would think the programmable part would have improved. Most everything I want it to do is a pain in the #$%!.  I am sure Amazon gets tons of requests for improvements but they are not listening or have a microscopic programming group or maybe just myopic... Spend some of the millions you are earning to add some features! Google is going to pass you by if you don't!",0
5,"Awesome very helpful give it a day or so to get used to I got a little
  
",26.Jan.19,Yes,"In love like really, only things I_ change is I_ love a guys voice like, hrmmm Brad Pitt or someone or even Better one of the first James Bond_ :-) also when I ask Alexa to read one of her stories they are about 2 minutes long and good so wish they would be longer.I have audiable so yes I can get some from there. Her jokes and games are awesome too. Again as a single mom who hears enough girl voices I would love a mans voide like brad Pitt pretty please can you fix that _",0
1,"I have no idea, I plugged it in for a minute
  
",26.Jan.19,Yes,"The whole idea creeps me out, I wish I could return this christmas present and get the cash so I could get something useful.  You do realize that it is listening to you, remembering what you are saying.  Your private world is no longer private. I would rethink this whole thing if you are considering getting one... just don't.",1
3,"Almost perfect
  
",27.Jan.19,Yes,"The sound quality and volume are SIGNIFICANTLY different from the 2nd gen. However, once you begin to really pump this up (turn the volume up) the bass comes through so much that the voice of the artist turns down way too much.**ALSO, MY BIGGEST ISSUE SO FAR HAS BEEN THE MICROPHONE ARRAY ON THIS THIRD GEN. I FIND MYSELF CONSTANTLY HAVING TO REPEAT MYSELF TO GET ITS ATTENTION ESPECIALLY IF I HAVE THE TV ON OR MUSIC PLAYING. THE SECOND GEN COULD HEAR ME FINE WHEN THOSE THINGS WERE PLAYING HOWEVER WITH ONLY FOUR MICS, THE THIRD GEN DOESN'T SEEM TO BE HANDLING THIS SO WELL. I HAVE THIS IN MY ROOM WHICH IS A VERY SMALL ROOM SO I THINK THIS IS PRETTY UNEXCUSABLE.**Withthat in mind this is a good pick up if you're coming from the second generation echo.. I hope that Amazon can fix the microphone issues I've been having",2
4,"New to this...Now with an update.
  
",27.Jan.19,Yes,"I just received my two  Echo Dots today, and have them up and running. I already had the Alexa app set up on my phone, and linked to the few smart devices I own, so the Echo set up was pretty easy. They seem to  have a good range for listening, being able to  hear my commands from across the room, and you can give each a different wake-up name so they don't get confused if within range of each other. The sound is perfectly adequate for talk radio, weather, news, etc., but not so good for music -- the speakers are fine for casual listening but I would not use them to replace my sound system. All in all, easy to set up, easy to use, fun to play with, and I'm just getting started!A few months later: I just set up a  Stereo Pair with my two Echo units, and I have to comment on how much improved the sound is! I get a true stereo effect, and they seem to sound better paired than they did as stand-alone speakers. Good move!",0
5,"Love it. Much better than previous version
  
",27.Jan.19,Yes,This 3rd gen is far superior in sound quality and accuracy of detecting words that the gen 2 device it replaced. The 2nd gen device is banished to the kitchen now!Works flawlessly with all home automation and audio-visual devices in my bedroom and office. The Bluetooth sync to my TV's sound bar is perfect and flawless.Only complaint is that the choice of songs/music that my amazon prime gives me is pretty lame. But that's not this device's fault!!,0
5,"Bullet proof little hockey puck of joy
  
",27.Jan.19,Yes,"My Alexa went swimming in the toilet, into a bag of rice on the sunniest window sill to dry and back in business.  good as new after a submersion.And it isn't hard to change the preferences to shut down the buying stuff verbally function, so it will work with roommates or kids who can't be trusted not to buy too much. love it!1 suggestion for improvement:  a battery so i could take it out in the yard or carry it room to room without losing sound.",0
5,"I like it!
  
",28.Jan.19,Yes,"I bought the echo dot because I wanted to learn how to create Alexa Skills. And I really didn't have much interest in actually using it (at first) but I after messing around with it I changed my mind lol.For its size the audio quality is decent. It's certain not high fidelity but is definitely good enough for listening to music while I'm working. I'm also impressed with how well the microphones work. I tried it where the dot was in a room on the second floor and I was heard correctly while I was on the first floor. It's a distance of about 25 to 30 feet and it's not in a direct line.And then there's the fun stuff... One day while my dog was hanging out with me I said ""Alexa bark like a dog."" Well, she did! And my dog was intently listening and turning his head from side to side.... Even after a bunch of dog barks (they're somewhat random) he still pays attention to it. And there's a whole bunch of silly things you can say to Alexa. It's fun trying different things just to hear what she says.The way Alexa deciphers the words you say is impressive. I discovered that speaking to Alexa in full sentences isn't always necessary. For example, I can say ""Alexa, what's my flash briefing?"" or ""Alexa, do the flash briefing thingy"" or just ""Alexa flash brief"".  And even ""Alexa, flash your briefs"" works LOL!",0
5,"My First Smart Speaker
  
",28.Jan.19,Yes,"I don't have anything to compare this to, but I am satisfied with my purchase.  The sound quality and volume is acceptable.  The set-up was easy.  Alexa plays good music for me.  Tells me interesting things in the morning.  Welcomes me home.  And knows the answer to most . . . many . . . er, well . . . some questions.Like many people, I was torn between the Google Home Mini and the Echo Dot.  I chose the dot, frankly for no particular reason.  Maybe because it's supposed to be better at operating stuff around the house (which I don't have yet anyway).  But I have stumped Alexa many times on things where I have immediately followed-up with ""Ok, Google"" only to have Google know the answer.  For example, ""Alexa, who plays Billy on Six Feet Under?""  Alexa was stumped.  Google knew immediately.  Oh, well.  I am sure that as I purchase more and more smart home products, Alexa will come through for me.",0
1,"Does not work in Trinidad
  
",28.Jan.19,Yes,"I purchased 6 of these units for my family. Amazon shipped each separately, costing me $864.00TTD in shipping expenses, that could have been avoided by simply sending them together. Furthermore, the EchoDot does not connect to YouTube, forcing you to purchase Amazon music. It is unable to play our local radio stations as well!!!! I wish I could return ALL of it because I just wasted my money.",2
3,"Doesn't like auto channel on 5ghz
  
",28.Jan.19,Yes,I've lost connection twice and I've only had it connected for 2 weeks since time of writing this. After week 1 it lost connection on it's own. Had a bear of a time getting it to see and reconnect to 5ghz. Don't recall the steps i took to get it to reconnect but I know it wasn't fun. Today it lost connection due to a router reboot I needed to perform. It would not see 5ghz only my 2.4. My google home mini lost connection too but after unplug/replug it was fine.  The mini is on the 5ghz too. No go with the dot. Tried everything and it would just not see the 5ghz. Did a quick google and someone said to put my 5 ghz on any channel except auto. That did the trick. 2.4 was on auto and the dot had no problem seeing it. Hopefully a firmware update will fix? Maybe it doesn't like my quantum gateway? Who knows. Other than that i like the device. Got it bluetoothed to my home theater system which i like. Don't think the mini can do that but maybe I'm wrong. I'm a prime member and amazon is my music ecosystem. Just trying to let people know about the 5ghz thing. Maybe I got a bad unit but the problem was easy to find on the web.,0
4,"Better speaker sound but worse microphone
  
",28.Jan.19,Yes,"I have the V2 and V3 (this one).  I set this one to ""Echo"" as the wake word instead of Alexa because the microphones on the V2s pick up my voice from clear across the house!These microphones don't pick up very well at all. You need to be right next to it.  However, they sound really good for music for such a small footprint.I have 3 of these for playing music in various areas of my house.  Placed strategically for Multi-room music (which is easy to set up and sounds great).",1
4,"I'm still asking myself why I bought this........
  
",28.Jan.19,Yes,"I never wanted this thing.  I bought it and in as much as I don't regret buying it, I have questioned myself why I bought it (other than that my nephew and niece have a couple of them)  There is a song trivia function that I think is cool, but the 'daily briefing' sometimes isn't current (not sure if that is an ""Alexa"" issue )  I do like the timer function. I find that to be useful when i'm cooking or doing multiple things at once. At times,  I have to repeat my question several times before it answers.  It's like she's asleep or something, LOL....",0
5,"Works as adverstised
  
",28.Jan.19,Yes,Got this one with the purchase of a Ring Doorbell.  It works well and not much to say that hasn't been said many times before.  The only personal observation I would add is that I have 2 Google Home Minis and I've noticed that they are better at random search questions than the Alexa.  I suspect that's simply because of the Google connection but it's not a show stopper.  I was thinking that I had to make a decision on an ecosystem but maybe not.  They seem to co-exist just fine.,0
1,"Fantastic technology - but one HUGE flaw that makes it worthless
  
",29.Jan.19,Yes,"I loved this fantastic piece of home automation/personal assistant technology...for about two days. That_ when we experienced one of our, all too frequent (two - three time daily)Momentary WiFi signal service drops - from our only one choice, D- rated local internet service provider (which caused ALL our Echo devices to drop offline - and these devices do NOTHING without a WIFI signal. Zip! Moments or hours later when the same WiFi signal was restored, NOTHING we tried could get the Echos to simply reacquire that same unchanged WiFi signal. After a 40minute tech support call to Amazon none of our Echo devices was able to reconnect... and Alexa can_ do _- without a WiFi signal. Seriously, an Apollo moon launch seemed easier than getting any one of our Echo devices back to tea quite a simple WiFi signal. After 15 minutes w tech support, we had DELETED every Echo device in our house (and deleted all our playlists, preferences and EVERYTHIG else we spent HOURS setting up. Really! I asked after the tech call went past 20 minutes with no results... Reacquiring a dropped out WiFi SHOULD be one simple voice command or button push (if the WiFi signal /credentials hasn_ changed since it was last connected). After working 45 min w tech support we still had no luck on reconnecting ANY Echo device to our lame WiFi (which can drop in and out several times a day) at which point I asked the Amazon agent  - do we have to go through this entire procedure EVERY TIME our lame WiFi signal drops out for even a second, to which she replied YES - at which point I told the agent to initiate a return for all of our Echo devices and related home automation devices. They were completely worthless to me with this one GLARING flaw. (And I had all the latest 2nd and 3rd gen High end Echo devices. No one thought to fix the huge flaw in three generations of the product line)? Well maybe I_ the only one who has WiFi that comes and goes.I love amazon and regularly place orders over $1000 a month just because it_ SO easy to do and always flawlessly fufilled...except the one MAJOR, MAJOR flaw in the whole, otherwise FANTASTIC Echo series of devices. The entire dropped WiFi signal SHOULD be fixed (provided the WiFi credentials haven_ changed) with a simple ALEXA, Reconnect to WiFi voice command or a one button push...and be back online and in business right away without the need of a 45 minute PLUS tech support call.Echo and Alexa are my favorite home Automation /personal assistant/ direct audio command to buy anything and everything from my beloved Amazon account, but this one flaw RUINED EVERYTHING. Other than that flaw I was fully investing into the whole Amazon Echo lifestyle, but unfortunately if your WiFi drops in and out your hosed and the entire investment in time and resources was for NOTHING!",1
2,"Awkward, frustrating, time waster
  
",29.Jan.19,Yes,"Total garbage. Not the device itself so much as the crappy software. You have to speak in very specific _omputer phrases to get it to work. If this is the future of AI, I_ not that worried. You cannot speak naturally to it at all. Want to arm your security..._lexa, set (name of system) to system mode (whatever). If you just try to say _et the alarm to away....nope. Doesn_ understand. So frustrating. Steve Jobs once said something to the effect that voice recognition is worthless if it has just a one percent failure rate. That is so true. In the time it takes me to figure out how to awkwardly tell Alexa to do something, I could have done it manually five times.Also, I have huge privacy concerns with this thing as do many people. There is a mute button but it just lights up, how do I know it really isn_ still listening to me.Also, the Alexa app is terrible. Probably reminiscent of the Amazon phone. Remember that? No? That is because it sucked and was only sold for a short time.Sorry folks, the future is not quite here yet where you can talk to you computer and get relevant responses like in Star Trek.",0
5,"What a great smart home device to have.
  
",29.Jan.19,Yes,"This is my third Echo dot so far and I love this thing. Its entertaining, it plays music, controls my Firesticks, lights and plays music. There are many other things that make this great, but it would take time to write it all down.I'd say when it comes to smart home devices, this is by far my favorite. They look great on the nightstand or living room side table.My only criticism on the the Echo is the reminder function. Now this may be my lack of knowledge of the Alexa platform, but to that it is a little annoying when you set a reminder message and it continues to repeat that message until you tell it to stop.Other than that one small issue, it is a great device for the household.",0
5,"speaker quality and style much improved
  
",29.Jan.19,Yes,"I received this Echo Dot in one of those ""Santa"" games at Christmas. Already had an older one downstairs, but this one has an appealing ""upholstered look"" and a much better speaker. Only problem (not amazon's) was when I went to set it up. Yahoo had so many ad sites above the official site that I accidentally went to a fake site, and it took me a couple minutes to realize I was giving info to the wrong people! Please be careful when you do your setup that you are on the official amazon site for Echo Dot. Otherwise, great product, and I love being able to get news, classical music and quick answers right at my writing desk.",0
1,"Absolutely useless piece of garbage
  
",30.Jan.19,Yes,"This thing is an absolutely useless piece of garbage. It hardly does anything useful and it is the most frustrating device I have ever had to set up. You would think for a multi-hundred billion dollar company they could design even a remotely user friendly app and interface. It is a pain enough to get this over priced paper weight to connect to the WiFi, god forbid you get a new router and have to try to reconnect this hockey puck to the new router. It just keeps telling you to do things in circles and never actually allows you to connect. After I am done writing this review, I am literally going into the garage and smashing this useless piece of $%#&amp; with a hammer and going to Best Buy to purchase a google home device. Avoid like the plague....",1

",30.Jan.19,Yes,"WHY DO YOU NEED TO LISTEN IN ON PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS WILL PROBABLY THROW IN TRASH WILL RETHINK ABOUT  BUYING FROM AMAZON AFTER THIS . NOT HAPPY !!!!!!!!!!!! ,first one I owned thought it should work better, some things work great others not so much Do like the eco over all  , Bumped up the star rating because an Amazon rep. called and is trying to help me with problems 2 thumbs up to amazon for the call !!!! Rep helped and got most bugs worked out, BUT STILL NOT VERY HAPPY WITH YOUR PRIVACY VIOLATION!!!!",2
4,"Echo Dot (3rd gen) Smart speaker with Alexa
  
",30.Jan.19,Yes,"I got my first Echo Dot smart speaker for Christmas 2019 and generally I am pretty happy with it. It has good sound and was easy to set up. I mainly use the Echo Dot for music playback, news and free trivia. I had a free trial of Amazon Music Unlimited and was happy with that. Afterwards, I set up a free Spotify Account and I found out the Echo Dot only syncs with a premium Spotify account, I was disappointed with that. I do have some iTunes songs to import and will try my free Pandora and iHeart Radio accounts.The biggest disappointment was the iOS Alexa app for the Echo Dot. I put it on my iPad and I find that the app is slow, buggy, and freezes. It needs some refining and updating. I didn't want to add my contacts for privacy reasons and it keeps prompting me to do that as well as turn on the bluetooth on my iPad.The adjustments on the app for sound quality do not work and it misidentifies my other Amazon devices. There have been no app updates and that is disappointing because it does need a lot of work.If you are buying the Echo Dot for just music and news and other minor things, I would tell you to wait until the software app for the Dot is updated/reworked. The dot itself works good but sometimes spits out strange phrases like ""Its too cold to go outside"" and ""I wouldn't do that"".",0
4,"Ordered 4, 3 worked, one didn't....
  
",30.Jan.19,Yes,"So I ordered 4 of the dots, I have the large echo in kitchen. I decided to place one echo in each kids room so I they can listen to music and I love the drop in feature so I can rally my troops for meals without screaming 10x upstairs. So out of 4, one echo dot was not working. The customer service team was excellent in troubleshooting and realizing it was not user error. Here is where it gets weird. The replacement echo dot arrived a few days later. I didn't have time to pull it out of the box and set it up until yesterday. Guess what? Same thing! It wouldn't turn on. The unit was receiving power, the mute button would illuminate when I pressed it, but other than that, I couldn't get it to light up or connect to the internet because it wouldn't turn on at all. AGAIN customer service was AWESOME. I am now waiting for a replacement for my room. BUT I think it sounds like you have a 50% chance of getting a good echo or a bad one. Hope they last!",0
5,"Perfect Echo companion
  
",30.Jan.19,Yes,"We have several Echo Dots all over our home (one in each bedroom, as well as our study, and garage.  Our big Echo is in the living room and the only one we use to play music.I like the convenience of having a Dot in other rooms because we use it to control our Phillips Hue light system and can turn on lights from any room in the house. It also makes it easy to add something to my shopping list if I think of something in a room separate from where I would keep my list.I have the solid black, solid white, and this charcoal grey. I like that you can get different colors to match the decor in each room. As for the sound it really isn't bad, but just not as robust as the larger Echo device.",0
2,"Don't bother trying to find Voicecast!
  
",30.Jan.19,Yes,"I bought the Dot to hook up to my Fire tablet listen to music in two rooms in my house, knowing that Voicecast would allow me to do this. After days of struggle, this is what I found out after an hour online with the tech:""Thanks for being so patient with us, let us check from our end, if that is it.I am really sorry, after consulting leadership and higher authorities we got to know that the Voicecast settings have been deprecated on January 20 2019.Also, I am sorry to let you know that we do not have information on when the feature will be back.I apologize for the inconvenience caused to you.""Amazon has specifically made this impossible!",0
4,"The product is good by itself but needs improvement!
  
",30.Jan.19,Yes,"I admit I was disappointed with this Echo before then after posting my experience, amazon reached out by phone and email to try to understand the reason behind the review. After the call, I discovered so many features and capabilities.Such as: ability to create groups for difference ""smart"" items you want controlled together, the ability to connect via bluetooth to an existing speaker, connect to echo itself by bluetooth, link to fire stick,...After this experience, I highly recommend amazon to streamline the setup process towards minimizing frustration to the user further down the roads. Also, improve microphone and initially set only one source of flash news until the user changes it (e.g., NPR or BBC?)Overall, i recomment this product, looks cool and my friends always get impressed when i say:"" Alexa, turn off the lights!"".",0
2,"Poor performance
  
",30.Jan.19,Yes,"I have three dots and an Echo. I can stand next to this dot and the older model (2nd gen) that's in the other room will hear, understand and answer but this one won't. It lights up like it hears me but it doesn't seem to be able to recognize what I'm seeing, especially in noisy situations. And it cuts in and out mid-routine. Pretty much the only time I can count on this one working properly is middle of the night when there's no other noise. Of all the Alexa items I have, the original 2nd gen dot works the best: better than the Echo and better than the 3rd gen dot. It's like they're getting prettier but less dependable...",0
5,"Love Alexa!!!
  
",30.Jan.19,Yes,"We received our Echo Dot in a Pirate Santa Gift Exchange over the holidays. It was something we would have never bought for ourselves.  But...after hooking it up and using it, we would highly recommend one!!!  We can play our music from Sirius on it or simply ask Alexa to play music from the 70s and poof!  There it is!  weather reports, news reports and just about any question she can answer!  Our grand daughter loves asking her when Mind Craft was developed because it's the same date as her birthday!  It's also fun to ask her to tell us jokes.  Easy to install and use. We recommend everybody have Alexa join their home!!",0
5,"A great addition
  
",30.Jan.19,Yes,"We already had 2nd Gen Dots. We wanted to expand our coverage and bought these 2 3rd Gen Dots. The older ones were good; these are much better. The audio when we play music through them is really very good - noticeably better than on the 2nd Gen. The microphones seem to be a bit more sensitive, too. Our new Dots can hear and respond to us from all the way across the largest rooms in our house with no errors (well, only a few - but many fewer than the 2nd Gen). Overall, we are quite pleased with these and highly recommend them. Keep on improving, Amazon!",0
5,"How Will Alexa Fit Into Your Life
  
",30.Jan.19,Yes,"I'm glad I bought these. They were easy to set up. I am better organized, entertained, and fascinated by the technology. It can be pricey when you consider your subscription services that can be connected to Alexa. I decided what I would use and the best rate for the service. For example, I stream my music through Amazon Unlimited instead of another popular service for savings. The dots do not take up much space and you can purchase dot hangers that connect to the wall.",0
5,"Got this as a gift and wasn't sure how much I would use it
  
",30.Jan.19,Yes,"I enjoy listening to music from the 40's, 50's, and 60s, plus classical music and the Echo Dot provides me hours of music.  It's so nice not to have to search for a CD and put it in my CD player to listen to music I love.  Plus Amazon has extensive resources for various types of music.  I haven't used it to set a timer yet, but I plan on doing so.  I had it read a story to me and tell me what the weather is like where I am.  Turns out, it was a very thoughtful gift.",0
4,"Cool gizmo
  
",30.Jan.19,Yes,"We have been using this for about 2 months and find it useful. I play music from it while cooking, use it for a cooking timer, ask the weather and other simple questions, love the smart outlet/ light compatibility feature and the drop in feature. I probably don_ use it to the extent you can but overall it has been proven to be useful. Only complaint is sometimes Alexia doesn_ respond and the complexity of naming/ assigning devices to the smart function.",0

",30.Jan.19,Yes,"My whole house is filled with Echo devices, although I don't personally have any of the 3rd generation yet. I'm sure I'll upgrade eventually. I wanted to give this a shout out though, as the most popular White Elephant/Yankee Swap gift in both my work and family swaps this year. This was passed around more than the scratch tickets or the snack basket! Everyone likes technology, and this is an approachable introduction to a smart home",0
1,"impossible to understand intercom messages and other problems
  
",31.Jan.19,Yes,"The echo dot 2nd generation worked perfectly as an intercom using the _rop in command . The 3rd generation echo dot has the audio going in and out mid sentence making it impossible to understand the echo as an intercom.  As time went on the 3rd generation speaker did not get any clearer.  Swapping out one 3rd generation for another did not solve the problems with clarity.  The 3rd generation has problems when two people are talking more than the 2nd generation.  Also music playing on either side of the connection will cause problems with message clarity on the 3rd generation echo dot.  The 3rd generation device rather than learning your voice and distinguishing when you talk and subtracting out background noise has the background noise interfere with message clarity.  The 2nd generation echo dot does not have as much background noise, music or both people talking at the same time causing the speaker to garble the message as the 3rd generation.  The 3rd generation relies on training the user to turn down the music, background noise and to wait patiently while the person on the other end talks.  As customers, We expect more from our ""artificial intelligent"" devices.Service was responsive and polite and made overtures to correct any problems.  However, promised call backs were not made even though they were scheduled.  The service representative did NOT give us a call back number or email to respond or add additional concerns.  When additional concerns were raised on the phone, the service representative listened patiently, but did not give us any solutions or answers.  Hindsight suggests that perhaps the service representative was more concerned with the low rating of the device than correcting the problem?Other problems, the turn in policy on the 1st and 2nd generation echo when upgrading to the 3rd generation must be made at the time of purchase and does not reduced bargain pricing such as the buy one get on free deal that was advertised.  We are still not clear how the turn in your old to get a discount on the new works, even after talking to the service representative.The 3rd generation echo dot appears to be just as dumb as the other echo devices.  This means that the ability to answer questions with answers other than ""sorry, i dont understand"" or ""sorry I cannot help you with that"" has not improved.  We have both the echo dots which we use primarily as an intercom device, and the ok google device.  The ok google device does not appear to work as an intercom or an announcement device, but it answers many more questions with actual practical answers from wikipedia and the irs.gov websites.  So other than the intercom and broadcast announcement function, the ok google is the more useful device.Another problem we have encountered is that the echo dot devices often disconnect from the WiFi and require reconnection much more often than the ok google device.  Unfortunately, these ""artificial intelligence"" digital assistants are not smart enough to reconnect to the WiFi without human help and the use of a phone, tablet or computer based application or program.  The process of reconnection is anything but intuitive and is an avoidable nuisance.  We as customers expect that our digital assistants should be smart enough to reconnect to the WiFi without human intervention.  Artificial Intelligent devices are not very intelligent if they cannot reconnect to the WiFi without human intervention.As a customer, we hope that the software upgrades will address these problems.  As a loyal Amazon customer and supporter of the echo devices and technology, we expect more from our ""artificial intelligent"" devices.  At the very least the devices should become smarter, more useful, and less of a pain in the ass as time goes on.  So far our experience has been the opposite, the devices seem a bit dumber, less useful and more of a pain in the ass.We purchased a TP-link home mesh system with three channels (the expensive one) because our echo dot version 3 network kept disconnecting.  The description of the mesh network device said it was compatible with the Alexa.  The devices keep disconnecting and now the drop in function between the home office echo dot 3 and the bedroom echo dot 3 no longer functions even though the echo dot 3 (ED3) in the bedroom can drop in on the ED3 in the home office.  Considering the only reason we purchased this system for over $1000 for all equipment was to get a functioning intercom.",1
5,"Sounds better than gen 2 and fits our decor better
  
",31.Jan.19,Yes,"It's an Alexa Dot that does just what the last Dot did, so there's not a lot to say other than the sound has a bit more bass and is ""fuller"" and nicer sounding than the o4 gen 2 Dots we have around our home.  The more tactile feel of the fabric covering, and the shape of the new gen 3 feels more refined and less ""techy"" than the last Gen 2 device, though I was able to 3D print wall hangers for a couple of our Gen 2s that allow us to get them off the furniture.  That won't be as practical with the new shape, but then again the new shape looks nicer on our furniture.  At the end of the day,  we are in deep on home automation.  In fact I know carry a Google Home mini with me on monthly business trips to Ireland and the UK - I need an AI to talk to!",0
5,"Definite improvement over previous version
  
",31.Jan.19,Yes,"The new version is a big step up in audio quality from the previous version. Plus, the fabric does make it look nicer. I don't know how much of this is just due to my setup, but I have this echo on a table near me in my living room (&lt; 3ft to my 4 o'clock position -back right- from where I sit) but the Echo Input that's maybe 30 ft away (in my 8 o'clock position -- almost fully 'left') in my kitchen will hear me and respond. I wish timers weren't device-specific! Because when one of them heard me set the timer but another one hears me cancel it when it's going off, it's a little frustrating.",0
5,"""GURL....! Alexa sounds GOOD!""
  
",31.Jan.19,Yes,"Sorry... I was attempting to be funny however that is what both myself and my niece said as we turned her on and played our first song. This little speaker has AMAZING sound quality - a definite upgrade from the first generation Alexa which my sister owns. We picked this up for my niece for her room and set up was a breeze, all the regular bells and whistles are there but the sound quality was not expected for such a little device. I was thinking something similar to the JBL Clip's quality but this NEW Alexa sounds real good. For that you have a great purchase. I have been thinking about picking one up for my room if I can figure out how to sync it to my iPad via bluetooth - if Alexa can do that than count me in as a second buyer!",1
4,"Wonderful for sight impaired or handicapped people.
  
",31.Jan.19,Yes,"I wanted and received an Echo Dot for Christmas, as my vision is very poor and I could no longer set my alarm clock.  Someone in computer class had mentioned they use it for an alarm and talking without their phone.  It is easily set up with an app on your cellphone and can dial anyone listed on your cellphone, just by telling it to call so-and-so.  It is not as knowledgeable as Google or Suri, but gives temperature, time and answers many questions.  There is corresponding equipment you can buy to make it do other things, like change your thermostat and turn lights on or off, etc.  I request  various types of musican artists, and command the volume up, down or off.  This is a God send for sight impaired or handicapped people.  I had to buy a second one, so I could have one on each floor of my house.  I was impressed with the sound quality, for such a small item.  I am not knowledgeable about the larger Alexa's, etc., but assume they would do even more.  I got this on sale for $30.00.  More than worth the money!  I only gave it 4 stars out of 5, because it doesn't know the answer to quite a few questions I ask it.",0
4,"Works well
  
",31.Jan.19,Yes,"This device works well, but I think it's very gimmicky.  It was fun to play twenty questions when you first open it, but now it has lost the fun.  To use the search function is fine, but sometimes alexa misunderstands me no matter how clearly I speak.  I don't have the smart lightbulbs/outlets so those features aren't able to be used.  I hooked the device up to my TV, and she has some difficulty doing what I would like for her to do.  Some features I can't access at all, such as fastforwarding my DVR.  This is a cool toy but I don't see me using it frequently.",0
5,"Fav thing is lists that are saved!
  
",31.Jan.19,Yes,Love it. After awhile alexa learns the things you ask for and how you ask. Its pretty cool. I mean everyone in the reviews already said what's needed to be said. I do like though that sometimes I will remember to write something down I need from the store so I just tell alexa. Once I'm at the store I just bring my app and the list is there..its been a huge game changer for a working mother like myself.,0
5,"Perfect for voice controlling your TV or firestick.
  
",1.Feb.19,Yes,"Everyone who has one of these has their reason. Here is mine. I am not interested in a smart home. Not interested in turning on lights with my voice. What I wanted it for was my Fire Stick. Together with my Fire Stick, I can basically control my TV. If I say ""Alexa fire TV home"" it turns my TV on. If I say ""Alexa launch Netflix"" or ""Alexa launch Hulu"", the apps will launch. There is a wide range of things the Dot can do with the apps on my Fire Stick. Many apps. I can ask it to play a particular show. if the show is on Netflix it will play on Netflix, if the show is on Hulu it will play on Hulu. It pretty much knows what to do. I can ask it to pause. And then ask it to play. I can ask it to backup or skip minutes. Which is really great when I step out of the living room for the kitchen &amp; realize I should have paused. The Dot can hear me from the other room. I can ask it to skip episodes or go back episodes. When the credits are playing at the end of the episode, I can tell it to skip to go right to the next. I have spent hours without touching my remote. It could also work my Vizio smart TV, but I decided against it, because the 4K Fire Sticks apps movies &amp; shows look phenomenally better than the smart apps. I have also used it to set alarms. ""Alexa set an alarm for 45 minutes"" while I am cooking or something. It's great. You have access to all the prime music &amp; the Dot Speaker itself is pretty good. I have Amazon unlimited, so I have access to pretty much any music you can imagine. Just ask &amp; she shall play. Good for play music in the background while you're cleaning or something. Every morning I asked what the weather report is &amp; I get a much more detailed report than Google ever did on my phone. If it's going to snow that day I can ask how much snow and she'll tell me. I've actually spent time sitting &amp; asking Alexa questions. She is so knowledgeable, that you could almost have a conversation with her. Lol. If someone's over just for fun I'll ask her to tell a joke &amp; she's set to a Jimmy Fallon joke. So Jimmy Fallon will tell one. It's cool. This thing works a million times better than I thought it would oh, and I thought it would work pretty damn good.",10
3,"Follow Up Mode Does NOT Work When Connected To Bluetooth Speakers
  
",1.Feb.19,Yes,"Overall, this is a bigger and bulkier Echo Dot, but with that, comes louder and better sound, so I am happy with that fact.  That being said, it does not appear that this latest version of Echo Dot offers anything over and above a larger footprint and better sound.I am disappointed that the unit does not allow Follow Up Mode when connected to external speakers, via Bluetooth.  This functionality is one that I've come to enjoy, and it's annoying to lose it when connected to speakers.Overall, I like the product but wish Amazon would get the bugs out of them.  I've had issues with other DOTS as well, such as stereo right/left performance issues, inability to re-connect to bluetooth speakers, horrible performance when ""grouping"" a few dots together for music, ...to name a few.While music and speaker performance seems to be a problem for me, overall, I do really like the functionalities that they offer above just music!  I use ""Reminders"" a lot and this functionality makes me very happy.  ""Drop-In"" mode is another feature that comes in handy, as I have a family member that cannot easily make contact, so this makes that process very easy.  And as well, she can simply tell the Dot to call me, with her voice.  This is a great tool for a disabled person, or other similarly limited person, health-wise.",0
1,"Alexa is unresponsive and kind of useless
  
",1.Feb.19,Yes,"TL;DR; I acknowledge that a lot of my complaints may stem from my own inability to use this device properly. In the same breath, I have not been able to find easy answers to my questions and there does not appear to be a real person to talk to about this thing and the Alexa service. In the end it may be I am simply not willing to put in the effort to configure it properly, however I feel for a device that is supposed to be easy to setup and use, it really falls short of that mark.We bought this primarily for our kids to use. We have a friend who loves theirs and says that they have all kinds of 'Skills' games that they installed and that their kids love to play. It also plays music and audio books and all kinds of stuff! sounded great and at under $50 it seemed like a great deal.We got ours and plugged it in. Package quality was great and it is a nicely built device. We plugged it in and downloaded the Alexa App; and this is where the frustration began.My Wife and I both own a Galaxy s5 and we installed the app on her phone. Adding the Freetime mode and the kids profiles was fairly straight forward and then we attempted to add Skills. The App freezes and becomes 100% unresponsive. You can't even browse the skills. We tried turning the phone off and on again. Uninstalling and re-installing the app. We tried emptying the app cache. We followed a few articles but in the end simply could not get it to work.The kids by this point are starting to play with it and they are asking it questions and that seems to be interesting enough and then they ask it to play music. Well Alexa is only tied to Amazon Music. You need an Alexa app or Skill to use anything else...well that is not helping us. We don't have an Amazon music subscription and we don't have any interest in getting one because we have Pandora and we also have Youtube Premium. So bummer.Finally after searching through the help documents I find out there is also a Browser interface for Alexa. So I pull that up and we Add the NPR One Skill, the Pandora Skill, the Audible Skill and A Game Skill or two. Looks like it is getting better. Then we tried to use them.We tried every 'Phrase' to get any of the skills to work and Alexa just replies ""Sorry, I can't do that."" to anything other than, ""Alexa, Play {song name here}"". None of the installed skills will work.So we try turning off 'Free Time' and adjusting the parental controls and just about everything else we can think to do. We go searching for help and can't find a way to get a number for a live person to ask questions too and the documentation is specific but kid of useless because it is not about troubleshooting, it is all about how to do X.I really kind of feel like I purchased a voice enabled bluetooth speaker and that is it. The only thing that is keeping me from asking for my money back is because the Kids do like to listen to music on it and they can control it without my help, so there is that. But from everything it seems to promise, I think it fails in just about every way.",1
5,"Vast improvement over gen 1 and gen 2...
  
",1.Feb.19,Yes,"The Echo Dot Gen 3 is a vast improvement over the older models.  The audio quality is so far above that of the older generations that a comparison can't really be made.  I was amazed by the sound quality that comes out of this little device.  Microphone reception is outstanding, with music playing at 50% volume the Echo Dot Gen 3 had no issues hearing and responding correctly to my voice from across the room.  I didn't feel the need to test the microphone with the volume any higher than 50% as that was plenty loud enough for my liking.  Build quality is great and looks nice.  The device was simply to register and is simple to pair with other devices via Bluetooth or on the same WiFi network.  So far I am really enjoying the Echo Dot Gen 3.",0
5,"New Echo Dot Has Multi-room Music solution
  
",1.Feb.19,Yes,"I bought two 3rd generation echo dots, one for each of two bedrooms, to go with my existing echo which is already linked via Bluetooth to a Bose Wave system. I paired two Bluetooth speakers to the echo dot in one room, and am using the echo dot as the only speaker in the other. I_e been able to add a Bluetooth transmitter via the aux jack on one of the echos and from their paired two speakers in stereo mode. This was/is a bit buggy but generally easy to get working properly. I was also able to create an _verywhere group to command multi room streaming from any room using either echo dot or the echo. It works fairly well, with minor syncing issues between the room. Also, multi room eliminates the blue tooth connection between the echo and the Bose Wave system, and the sound in that room comes directly from the echo. I think the multi room and stereo pairing are great features and will improve over time. I would hope eventually the echo dots could directly pair with a set of stereo speakers without the use of the transmitter All in all, a great procur for the price.",0
3,"It's cool except it won't do the thing I wanted it for.
  
",1.Feb.19,Yes,"I wanted to use it to play music, and was a little disappointed to find out that I cant play my own playlists through the Alexia app for the I-phone. If there is a way to do it it's too confusing for me to figure out. I can understand a little because Amazon wants you to subscribe to a monthly fee so that they will make more money. I can play some free services like I heart radio which does have playlists, but they don't always play the music I like. Actually it would be much easier for me to play  my I phone through  some blue-tooth speakers and be done with it.",0
5,"Beats the Heck Out of My Shower Radio
  
",1.Feb.19,Yes,"I like to listen to sports radio and / or music when I am showering in the morning and the reception in my bathroom was horrible yielding only two or three stations full of static.  I put the Echo Dot in the bathroom and now stream my favorite sports radio station in crisp, crystal clear sound. Also great for listening to music and or asking Alexa to add toothpaste, shaving cream, shampoo etc. to my shopping list when I am running low on supplies. The speaker has great sound quality, the Dot looks nice and it takes up very little room on our bathroom vanity.  A great purchase!",0
5,"The best gift I never knew I wanted!
  
",1.Feb.19,Yes,"I received this as a Chrisymas present and so glad I did! I never thought I would want one, seemed kind of hokey tbh. But I love playing music on it, getting the weather, etc. I can yell out items from the kitchen to add to my  grocery shopping list and my 10 year old son can add things to his wish list so I know what he needs/wants when I'm out. I even picked up some smart plugs and can have Alexa turn the light on or off when my hands are full. It's a huge help when I am coming home from work after dark and I'm juggling my work bag, my laptop, my son's backpack, and the mail. And the to do lists and reminders help me make sure I never miss an important deadline again. Alexa is my new best friend, I'm not sure how I ever managed without her!",0
5,"Great at capturing voice
  
",1.Feb.19,Yes,"This speaker is great at hearing me even when the music is playing. I grabbed this speaker after utilizing alexa on a Sonos One speaker....so unfortunately, I was a bit sad to learn of the audio difference. But that was expected.  My issue is with the 'skills' of Alexa. The skills on the marketplace are very specific or dont seem to have a feature that is very helpful. Perhaps if they were organized in a better way, so that I could find something most useful to me? I haven't found one that I need/use that alexa doesnt do. My other concern. Is her knowledge on some basic questions. I also have google assistant in my house, i use google assistant for knowledge based questions or something I would search online. For example I ask Google what else an actor played in, or the definition of a word and get a great informative answer, and Alexa's answer to 'what is a other word for communication' was communicate... I use Alexa more for communicating with smart things in my house or connecting via bluetooth to my phone, or using the drop in feature with family.",0
4,"Speakers are SOOOO much better!
  
",1.Feb.19,Yes,"We already had a 2nd gen Dot, and were using PC speakers because music played so poorly on it.  The improvement in the still-small 3rd gen Echo Dot speakers is HUGE, and for our use (primarily music) it is sufficient without supplemental speakers.The reason for only 4 stars:  we also have a Google Home mini, and it still is superior to Alexa for random searches for information.  We use this feature less often than music, however, so this is not a show-stopper for us.",0
5,"Echo Dot 3 is Amazing!
  
",2.Feb.19,Yes,"I recently purchased Echo Dot 3 with Alexa, primarily for starting a Smart Home system. I am disabled/handicapped and am confined to my bed most of the time. Since the disease I suffer from is progressive I felt that is time to prepare for worse days ahead. When it arrived, I was amazed at the things it can do. So far I have set up playlists on Amazon Music while I am waiting for my order of Alexa controlled outlets to arrive. As time and money allow, I will be adding more components to the Smart Home system. In the meantime, I have calm, soothing music playing all night long, helping to distract my mind from the physical pain that I suffer from 24 hours a day. That, in itself, is worth having Amazon Dot 3 and Alexa.",4
5,"Great device for Nursing Home Residents!!!
  
",2.Feb.19,Yes,This small device has brought my dad so much happiness - he lives in a nursing home and wasn_ able to have your typical phone and would lose his cell phone.  He loves music and reading books and so after using a dot at home I bought one for him.He is so much more upbeat now because he is able to call us when he wants and if he needs something.  He listens to music all the time and he can even enjoy a book if he wants since his eyesight is no longer that great.  I can_ say enough great things about this device and technology.  We just wrote up a list of most frequently used commands so my dad would always be able to have them available if he didn_ remember because of his dementia.The echo dot is the absolute best!! I would highly reccomend to anyone for home use .... and most of all... for a nursing home setting.,2
4,"Occasionally Disturbing Moments
  
",2.Feb.19,Yes,"Digital Assistants are getting better and better but still have distinct limits. The Echo Dot 3rd generation is no exception. There is information you might think would be easily accessible but is still met with ""Sorry, I don't know that yet ."" Part of it is a learning curve for the user in how to frame a question for the best chance of success so don't give up on one try. I won't bore you with all of  the features because they are quite easy to find on the item page, help, and in the Alexa app, but one recently really helped me out. Being a Baby Boomer, I have the occasional senior moment and managed to leave my purse with my cell phone and Fire tablet in a cab. I stopped hacking landline or VOIP a couple years back. The spare key got me inside, but how to call lost and found?Enter the little Echo Dot. I used the calling feature to reach customer service, but had the flash that I I should call my mobile to alert the driver. He turned out to be a jewel and was walking up to my door as my phone rang. It would have been fine but knowing I can make calls without my phone de-stressed me right away.It does a fine job for the price. I got it on sale before Christmas but like other Amazon devices, you can also divide the cost into several interest free payments. I recommend this digital assistant. It worked well even before I used the voice traing.And as for disturbing? One perk of digital assistants is playing with their Easter eggs and asking loopy questions. I did this with first Siri and later other devices. One wild question early on with the Apple program was asking where to hide a body. They.later made less helpful and supposedly less creepy. Naturally I had to give it a try with Alexa. She responded by offering a recipe for slow cooker carnitas.",0
5,"Great quality and great sound for this third generation Echo.
  
",2.Feb.19,Yes,The main reason I like this third generation Echo dot is that it has a more deep sound than the second generation version.A bonus is that you compare these as a stereo pair. In the Amazon Alexa app you can find an option for adding a stereo pair. Just follow the directions but keep in mind that if you have put them on a guest Network you cannot pair them because guest Networks do not allow each device to see each other. This was a bit of a dilemma for me because I prefer my Echoes to be on a guest Network to protect my main network from hackers but the more I thought about it and realized that I have antivirus software and firewalls and a lengthy wireless router access code I went ahead and took the plunge. I wasn't disappointed. When you play music on Amazon music it will stream stereo with left and right channels and it sounds terrific. Keep in mind that you cannot stream stereo from a Bluetooth device yet because they don't have that capability.,0
4,"fun
  
",2.Feb.19,Yes,"This is a fun little gagit.  My shark vac won't connect to it anymore and my lights go on and off that is connected by the base plugs but the bulbs that I have placed in the lights outside are great and stay on unless I ask alexa to turn them off.  When I forget to turn the garage lights on, I open the alexa app on my cell phone and tell alexa to turn on bulb one.  (YES never in the dark again trying to open the door)  I really like the sound when I ask her to play music.  When I have a question, you guested it, I just ask alexa.  I like that she finds my cell phone.  She turns on my tv and plays a movie if I know the name of it.  I like that I can tell her the name of the person I want to call and she calls them.  This would actually be great for old people that can't move around.  She would keep them company.  She will read stories to you.  So much fun.",0
5,"Must Have Device! Will Change Your Quality of Life!
  
",2.Feb.19,Yes,"Changed my day to day life at home. I was one of the people who though Alexa was stupid or just pointless in general. My friend convinced me to give it a try with my Fire TV and to buy some smart lights to go with it. Man am I glad I listened. Managing lights in my house has never been easier once the echo dot pairs with them, and when I lose the remote to my tv which happens oh so often because my dogs love to use them as chew toys, I can just ask Alexa to load up my show on Hulu no problem whatsoever! Alexa can raise and lower the volume on my tv, raise or dim lights in my house and so much more. I should have gotten one so much sooner. If you are someone like me who thought the echo dot/Alexa is stupid, please just give it a try with some smart devices to go alongside it and I promise you won_ regret it. I can_ imagine ever not having an echo dot in my household now. If using voice isn_ your thing you can also use the Amazon Alexa app to control everything right from your smartphone! So convenient! A must have device! Gen 3 is absolutely stunning to look at as well _!",0
4,"Good way to help children with routine
  
",2.Feb.19,Yes,"Setting up reminders for chores for the kids sure makes it easier around the house and getting stuff done.  From wake up to brushing teeth reminders make life easier for our home.  Alexa makes a great tool for school work too.  Math problems just ask Alexa for help.  We have Alexa set up so that every day Alexa tells us what the top story in History is.I like that the kids can tell Alexa call mom and she does.  Alexa will also make announcements so if I'm out for a stroll but stopped to talk with a neighbor I can announce to the kids that I have been delayed but not to worry.  I can also ""drop in"" and listen to things going on in other parts of the house.",0
5,"Love Alexa
  
",2.Feb.19,Yes,"Update - Dec 2019We just purchased two dots to use in our winter residence.  The sound is great for such a small unit.  We use Dot as an alarm clock, dictionary, weatherman, stop watch, radio (music), general informatio, etc.  Cannot live without Alexa.  All together we own two Echo and four Dot - they are positioned all around our home.We bought the Dot (3rd gen) for our bedroom and hoped to group it to Echo. But unfortunately, we have learned the two do not group.  We are disappointed with this however we are using Dot as a standalone Alexa.  It is small, has nice sound and is very helpful.  I need glasses to see the alarm clock - with Dot I just ask Alexa for the time!",0
5,"Love it
  
",2.Feb.19,Yes,Very nice toy. Great for playing music.i bought 2 a echo and a dot. The echo sounds better but the dot sounds good for the dive it is. Would liked it to been a tough louder but it_ good sound for the size and cost.  Just getting started with make my home a smart home but so far I like it a lot.  My son loves to ask Alexia questions. I would recommend it. Very easy to set up and tied my Apple Music to it. Really like being able to make calls with it. So if my son (7) needs to call me or want to call his Grandmaw he just says the name like it is in my phone and it calls. Very cool. Also can call between echo units is nice for when the kids are upstairs. No more yelling.,0
4,"Looks nice, might not hear me as well as our older version?
  
",2.Feb.19,Yes,"I like the look of this newer generation. I am just not sure this one ""hears"" our commands as well as the old one. It went in the same place as our old one, but this one seems to have just a tiny bit tougher time hearing us on first try and we kind of have to raise our voice. I think the actual speaker quality might be nicer than the older one...well, maybe not even nicer, but it definitely has a different sound. I had them both plugged in in the same place and there's a different sound to the newer version (3rd gen) than the older one (I think we also have a 2nd gen). I don't know if there's anything significantly different and if you have an older version, it should be just fine, so I wouldn't say an upgrade is needed unless you like the way this one looks better than the older one.",0

We bought several gen2 models for $17. We got the 3gen for $29. Its worth the difference! But between a $17 gen2 and a $50 gen3, I'd go with the gen2. Functionally it is identical.",0
1,"As of FEB 3 2019 the voice commands for navigating FireTV are not ready for prime time
  
",3.Feb.19,Yes,"I think the device deserves 3 or 4 stars when considered overall, but in terms of its use as a voice-control for FireTV, it is really almost useless. Echo DOT voice commands with FireTV and related apps are really hit and miss. Sometimes they work, but most of the time they don't.  It seems that the voice command intelligence may be privileging Amazon over other paid apps, listening for the title and ignoring the rest of the command if it is a title that Amazon offers.Alexa,  go to Hulu.

Honestly our house is too small for that many but I really enjoy having the music everywhere fill the house. I'm very pleased with the richness of the sound with the 3rd Gen Echo Dots. I have one Dot linked to my Yamaha stereo with 4 Bose speakers but now that I have the 3rd Gen Echo Dot I use the stereo a lot less often.The heather gray 3rd Gen was purchased for a client of mine who has memory issues from a car accident. Until I met him I thought my echo's were useful to help me remember typical stuff. Upon gaining an understanding of his situation I realized how important this could be for him. We've setup daily reminders, one of which is to remind him to set other reminders and it has helped him to remember crucial things, like to eat (he sometimes forgets for hours that his food is in the microwave). While I realize that there could be issues relying on a device it is very helpful for him.I think the biggest problem with the whole ""Alexa"" enabled category of products is that a lot of people don't realize all it can do and the great potential for special or particular needs. I hear a lot of people say ""oh, isn't that the thing that plays music?"". It's a Great Product in a line of Great Products (I have various other Alexa enabled products).So, i highly recommend you give it a try!",1
1,"What a complete waste of my time
  
",3.Feb.19,Yes,I received this product free as Amazon had some promotional thing going when I ordered my Blink camera.  I have tried in vain to set this thing up numerous times.  I should point out that I'm fairly tech savvy and can program all my other tech type stuff without any issues.  But this thing can't seem to locate my televisions no matter what I do.  I only have so much in patience and I reached it today.  I really don't like the fact that you have to provide so much personal information in setting it up.  I thought I'd give it a try to use it to run the televisions in the house.  But after so many tries I'm fed up.  I am already greatly uncomfortable with the reach that Google has into our lives.  I have embraced technology pretty well but I refuse to rely on the intrusion of this device to do things for me that I am completely capable of doing.  I wanted to return it but it appears that I'm stuck with it and thank goodness I didn't shell out any money on this paper weight.,1
3,"Potentially good. Needs heavy involvement to be useful.
  
",3.Feb.19,Yes,"The setup was simple though we had a couple hiccups connecting to our WiFi at first. Whether we blame Amazon or our provider, I don't know. The premise to call upon Alexa to answer our questions and perform tasks for us is very neat but ""she"" basically answers from Wikipedia. A good portion of the time, she simply ""has no opinion"" or ""cannot find info related to that"".To get the best out of Alexa, it appears you would need to purchase subscriptions that she can contact for you, like music or other entertainment. With time, money, and knowledge, one can probably make Alexa into a virtual assistant to be fawned over. For us regular folk, I feel it is too extravagant a venture.",0
5,"Speakers are awsome
  
",3.Feb.19,Yes,"I not only like the speakers, I love them. they are so easy to use. I love how you tell Alexa what to play and she does. I am a Country Music listener great songs she play for me through the speakers. I also love to listen to Ocean sounds and Nature sounds she play those for me too. You can get her to play almost any type of music you may love to listen to..Still waiting to use the other features she does, like turn your lights on and off. etc  lol lolMy friend call me lazy now, because Alexa play what I ask her to play for me. lol lol",0
4,"Pleasantly surprised by how useful it has been.
  
",3.Feb.19,Yes,"I bought this as an addon gift for my wife / family for Christmas. I thought it was cheap enough to throw into the pile and see what it was capable of doing for the family. My wife has set it up with her audible account, our spotify account, etc. etc. My 7 and 3 year old yell out commands to Alexa to play Kids bop Kids to start their mornings dancing. My 1 year old imitates them, its an oddity that I never thought of being in the household. There are so many small things that Alexa does that helps the family out that for the price.. it is an excellent addition to the household. I didn't give 5 stars as there are the ever present hangups with incorrect answers, Alexa responding to us when nobody asked it anything. etc.",0
5,"Amazon and Alexa Are A Wonderful Pair
  
",3.Feb.19,Yes,"Got Dot as a present...waited about a month to download app on phone to use...Once set-up, I was amazed by how wonderful it was...""Alexa, play..."" and she finds the song!  (You do need to purchase a subscription of Amazon Music for about $4/mo, but well worth price!)  Have it in kitchen on top of fridge so whenever I am in there for a short time, I always have a smile while listening to an old song favorite being played!  Great product...everyone should get one!!",0
4,"Welcome to the future
  
",4.Feb.19,Yes,"It's very tempting to give this thing five stars, but there is room for improvement. That said, it is an amazing bit of technology, well worth more than the price. Amazon must have been swamped with orders for these things at Christmas as I see it looks like a little back-ordering is going on. And I understand! If I'd known how cool this was back when they had the 2nd Gen for $20 I'd have bought one for everyone on my shopping list.Set up is easy, but you do need a phone or other device to set it up. After that, it's voice-activated astonishment. Ask for information about movies, the weather, history, solve math problems - it's all there for free. To fully enjoy the music you need Amazon Prime or Amazon Music, Pandora or similar. Over the holidays Echo kept us a steady supply of Christmas music - ""Play Christmas piano music"" - ""Play Andy Williams Christmas music"" - you get the idea.I keep my 2nd Generation Echo Dot in the kitchen, which is great for setting multiple times, looking up recipes, cooking times, adding items to a shopping list (and you can create multiple lists). The lists are kept updated on your phone, so if my wife needs to add something when I'm on my way to the store, it shows up right there on my list.Voice recognition is really good, though sometimes it can't provide information on what I'm looking for, something I'm sure will improve in time. Hopefully you'll be able to give it a personal name, right now you're limited to Alexa, Amazon, Echo, and Computer. That's right, ""computer."" I changed it to that for a day and enjoyed being Captain of a starship. Well, maybe an Ensign.My wife and I enjoyed the games feature; turns out the guy who never listens to the radio scored higher than the girl that can sing along with anything. Cool. Then there's stories, where Alexa tells you like a story of the day or something.Alexa has a little bit of a personality, too, which you'll find as you experiment.Directing Alexa to play specific songs or read books from my purchased library is a little tricky, this is where the phone app helps out. By the way, the app can control multiple devices.I haven't tried the extra features like appliances and cameras, but they seem affordable and very useful. Nor have I added any extra speakers, this 3rd Gen has really great sound, almost like stereo, and you can call up a simple equalizer on your app to change the sound. Volume control is easy, either by voice or by the up/down button on top.If you have wifi there is no good reason not to have at least one Echo in your home. It's fun, it's educational, and right now I'd be lost without one. The beauty of it is it available to anyone with a voice; hands-free, no real learning curve. Great for older people, invalids or those with disabilities.Can't wait to see what future versions will be like.",0
1,"Keep 2nd generation dot. 3rd generation is garbage
  
",4.Feb.19,Yes,"This new echo is terrible. I had unplug it and just not use it. It always misunderstands commands. It normally randomly starts listening when no one even said the wake word. 2nd generation is better.Update: after seeing this review amazon reached out to me so they could try to remedy the issues. After troubleshooting, the sent me a replacement refurbished echo dot. This one is still having similar issues as the last one. It's great that amazon is focusing on customer support but it's unfortunate that their product still isn't working right.",2
5,"Great for anywhere in the house!
  
",4.Feb.19,Yes,"I've had an Echo since the first generation and it's been very useful for a number of things including home automation of various things around my house. I have a number of lights in the house that are automated, a Harmony Hub that controls both our entertainment systems (living room and media room) and various Sonos speakers throughout the house to name a few.  I purchased three of these Dots to use around the house and they work really well with the home automation. I can walk pretty much anywhere in the house and issue commands to the Echo or a Dot and have one of them pick up the command and execute it. While my arms are full with groceries, ""Alexa, turn on the kitchen cabinet lights."" While I'm in the shower, ""Alexa, play classic rock music on the bathroom Sonos"". Or while I'm cooking in the kitchen, ""Alexa, turn on the TV."" It's kinda cool to talk to my house like the computer from Star Trek (and yes, I've changed the keyword on all of them to ""Computer!"").",0
1,"Won't pair with Alex Voice Remote
  
",4.Feb.19,Yes,"The first major problem with this device is that it won't pair with the Alexa Voice Remote.  Following Amazon's directions gets you nowherehttps://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201601810Tried this a few times as well as a bunch of other procedures.  Really lame.  Thus you can't control your TV with this POS as advertised.Alexa is spectacularly primitive compared to Siri and other competitors.  Here are some examples:""Alexa: Turn on TV""  response:  ""Sorry, provider is having trouble.""""Alexa:  display my watchlist""  response:  ""Hmm. I'm not sure.""""Alexa: watchlist""  response:  nothing""Alexa: go to watchlist""  response:  ""I'm not quite sure how to help you with that""""Alexa: show stardust movie""  response:  plays stardust song by Nat King ColeWhat an utterly lame product and an embarrassment for Amazon.",1
5,"Alexa! Where have you been all this time?
  
",4.Feb.19,Yes,"Alexa has helped me with many questions especially with how to spell certain words. I've heard of weird things other people have experienced with this item and last night during the Super Bowl I had a funny thing happen to me during the Beta Testing. As the commercial played my Alexa answered the questions/commands that were playing on the t.v.. It was amusing at first but quickly became annoying so I muted it.I use this mostly to play music as I fall asleep. Brahms is my choice. This composer wrote very soothing music, better than any raining, loon bird noise relaxing sounds that are being sold currently.The alarm strings work fine but I wish Alexa could provide a different tone. All in all it was a good purchase.",0
5,"Bluetooth setup, can use 5g, sound is a bit muffled
  
",4.Feb.19,Yes,"This is MUCH larger than the 1st and 2nd gen. Sound is a little more muted than the previous iterations. So it was a 4 star for me. However, two MAJOR differences make this a 5 star.1. You can use Bluetooth to set up. Using Wifi to previously setup was sometimes a real PITA. Much, MUCH easier now.2. Works with 5GHz as well as 2.2GHz. Nowadays, there's so many things that use the 2.4 band (including your microwave!) that the bandwidth gets used up and everything slows down. A definite improvement.The sound quality at normal volumes is less sharp than the previous gen dots. Slightly more bass- but nothing like the Echo's bass, and fewer highs. Sounds like it's under a pillow most of the time.",0
5,"Great for kid's rooms
  
",4.Feb.19,Yes,"Bought two of these in a recent 50% off sale to put in our kids' rooms.  Not sure they are worth the full price.  It's been a game changer in our family home, though.  Now we can ""drop in"" on a boy's room, or make an general announcement across all rooms.  This is effectively like having a home intercom.  We no longer have to choose between screaming at the top of our lungs or hiking all the way across the house to get our teenager's attention.  Also, our little one loves asking Alexa to play music, and now he can do that in his room too.",0
5,"Hard to set up initially but very easy to use
  
",4.Feb.19,Yes,"I did not like the instructions that came with the device. I definitely needed to contact support and work with them. If I had had the correct password for my WiFi, it would still have taken an hour or more. (One can get their working WiFi password on Windows 10 by click through a series of dialogs, but it is quite obscure and convoluted. Not Amazon's fault.One I had it set up, this device is delightful. So far I have been able to control it with brief, natural-language commands. Perhaps I should say 'her' rather than ""it.""",0
1,"don't do it
  
",4.Feb.19,Yes,"Spend more to get the echo, or just get the competitor, it's significantly more advanced. There are so many problems With this device, the frustration isn't worth $30. voice problems, connectivity problems, volume is easier to turn down manually that repeatedly asking, it has linked to my cart to buy things because it is so easily confused. It is convinced that I wanna hear barry manilow whenever I turn on the shower and ask for tunes. Got unlimited music for your echo 10 feet away? Get used to it trying to sell you what you already have. It won't link to my echo, but it will try to connect to the dot in the bathroom 2 floors up. Horrifying.",1
1,"They SUCK when paired with another Alexa device.
  
",4.Feb.19,Yes,They don_ pair well. They randomly shut off playing music if trying to play on the group. I have had it for 2 months and there has been a red ring light with Alexa saying she is having troubles several times which is concerning. I emailed Amazon a Customer Service twice through the Alexa app and got no response. I am a true Amazon fan through and through but the Alexa pairing I have SUCKS,1
3,"Doesn't support local music/audiobooks and can't communicate with Fire TV.
  
",5.Feb.19,Yes,"These are two really huge DUH! missing features. I've had a NAS (network attached storage) with all of my music, movies, tv, audiobooks, etc, stored on it for decades now. It's all distributed by DLNA - an industry standard supported off the shelf by everybody. I should be able to ask Alexa to play my own music from my own house - without paying more fees to stream a subscription service that STILL won't have my music on it. I want Alexa to play audiobooks I already own without paying for another subscription to an audiobook rental service.I also want Alexa to control my Fire TV. The Fire TV has an Alexa remote! I can see the TV in my kitchen, where this Alexa device is, and I want Alexa to play a TV show or movie on it. Two Amazon products, can't even communicate with each other.Those two are the biggest complaints about stuff that's missing that I expected to work.What's also frustrating is what barely works. If your music choices are very pedestrian, it's nice to say ""play some 80s music"" and let it go in the background. It's better than FM radio. Really though this shows how poor this option is - the selection is really shallow and repeats songs. There were 230 songs from that decade just counting the ones to hit #1 on Billboard. That's an entire day of listening to music just playing number one hits. Expand that to the top 40 or top 100, you could play 80s music for a month without hearing repeats. We should be able to give complicated commands to our voice servants like ""play every top 100 hit from the 1980s in order"". It's all databases, these are easy queries! psshIf you want to hear something very specific, good luck. Try to play classical music or opera by a specific performance, nope, too much detail confuses Alexa. If a performer has multiple versions of a song (on a live album and a studio album, for example) Alexa plays the first one she finds. Songs that have been covered by multiple performers, expect to never hear the one you want. Don't expect to hear any song that has non-English lyrics, if you can get Alexa to play artists from outside the USA/UK/Can/Aus English-speaking world at all.There's also the issue of being so rude to mispronounce my name and not being able to correct it.",0
5,"Good Product with Some Flaws, But Maybe a Bright Future!
  
",5.Feb.19,Yes,"Not a bad speaker for its size. I use it primarily for input and use Bluetooth 2.1 speakers for output. Adding skills is fun and increases the device's smarts. Amazon doesn't support the same wake words across Fire HD and Echo Dots. It's probably because they have different development teams that don't often speak or share a vision across platforms. We use ""Echo"" for a wakeword and that is not supported on the Fire HD 10 to get to ""Alexa"". If you use it for home control, you will get tired of Alexa's ""OK"" response. Amazon could mix it up a bit with OK, Done, As you wish, (your name here, voice recognized). There is surprisingly very little use of learned household names (associated to learned voices) on the account which makes ""Alexa"" seem a lot less personable. Even in a household environment with learned voices, Amazon is quick to remind you who controls the household account (Prime account holder name). This is unfortunate as households often share accounts. So, Alexa tells you that the Prime owner in the household was the one to last listen to a station on TuneIn even when it was another household member that requested it and last listened to it. Aside from those quirks, which should get programmed out, the Echo Dot 3rd Gen is great to listen to music and radio as you move from room to room around the house, or just need the temperature and forecast when getting ready to go out. Some day, ""Alexa"" may even use Google instead of Bing and really improve/expand the AI on Internet searches and choosing ""readable appropriate answers""!",0
4,"My parents love it
  
",5.Feb.19,Yes,"This was purchased as a gift for my parents for Christmas. One night I wokeup and heard my Mom having a full on conversation with Alexa.  This is wonderful because she is blind and has never used the Internet, but adores Alexa___.  My dad talks to her every morning to get weather and news updates, etc.  Next step is to get them ordering a good portion of their groceries online so they can be delivered to them. They also love listening to old 50s music online.  My last day of the visit they danced to one of their favorites.  Thank you Amazon__.",1
4,"Not worth the extra cost vs the older echo dots
  
",5.Feb.19,Yes,"This 3G echo dot is a little bit louder than the past generation, but overall there are no other significant improvements. Yes, it is shaped a little bit differently, slightly larger,  and covered with fabric, but, in my opinion it is not worth the extra cost since very few people spend much time looking at their Echo Dot versus talking and listening to it. I do wish they would move more quickly improve the brain of Alexa to make it more accurate and so it will stop trying to sell me products from Amazon all the time. Overall, I do have several echo dots in my house that I use as an intercom, for instant answers to questions, and for playing music and radio on demand. Also, they need it to respond to _ey Alexa so there will be many fewer instances when it self-activates when nobody is talking to it.",0
5,"Practically free, endlessly useful
  
",5.Feb.19,Yes,"We currently have 4 alexa speakers in the house (Living room, kitchen, loft, bedroom). I will be adding one to our bathroom soon. I basically use these for 2 purposes. The main purpose is to control our wemo outlets (echo lights on). Recently we have started using the music group functions and it has been amazing. If I am do chores or getting ready to go somewhere I can say ""Echo play 80s music everywhere"" and the same song will start playing throughout the whole house. We have the gen1 dot in our master bedroom and the sound quality of these newer speakers blows that one out of the water. I will be replacing that older dot with one of these newer models. These are pretty amazing considering the negligible cost.",0
4,"Works pretty well, once setup that is...
  
",5.Feb.19,Yes,"I ordered two of these, because I read about the drop in feature and figured having two of them would be useful, and could use it from different ends of the house.  First off, the setup could use some work, it was kind of confusing and very convoluted.  It took at least 3 separate tries to setup the first Echo Dot, it would get partially through a software update and then fail with an error.  I had no clue if I was doing something wrong, and was about to the point of just returning them out of frustration.  Finally on the third try the software update finally went through and voila, it said setup was complete.  I thought a miracle had happened.  I tested a few things, and Alexa responded as expected.  When I went to setup the 2nd Echo Dot, expecting the same amount of struggle, and it literally was done in a few seconds.  I had no issues whatsoever.  I don't know if the first unit was able to share information with it, or what the issue was but it was done and working in no time, and it was farther away from my WiFi routher than the first one is.  Weird.Then I hit another frustration point, when I tried to setup Alexa to launch Netflix and Hulu on my Firestick 4K.  When I tried to activate the Netflix and Hulu video skills in Alexa, for the life of me I couldn't figure it out, and had no idea what I was doing wrong.  I think Alexa was confused because there were multiple Fire TV devices on my account, and she didn't know which one to launch the program on.  Finally out of frustration I unlinked/de-registered the other devices since I was not going to be using them anyway, and voila, it started working.  It was all very confusing and frustrating, but in the end I finally got it working.  It seems to be a useful product, and have already configured smart plugs to turn on lights.  I really like being able to get information instantly, like when does a store close in my area, etc.  I hope to learn more useful things it can be used for.  However, it still feels sorta stupid to be talking to a machine, but maybe I'll get past that.  All in all it seems like a decent product for the money invested, so we'll see.",0
5,"Simple but one of the most impressive tech I own
  
",5.Feb.19,Yes,"I love this thing. In fact I love it so much I purchased 4 of them all at one. It_ a cool experience talking to Alexa and getting things like the weather, news briefs, shopping lists, and so much more. I have linked it to my nest thermostats and I can tell it to change the temperature and works flawlessly. It also works with my ring cameras. My only regret is not getting one sooner. BUT, I got them at their new lower price of 29.99 and they had a sale for Black Friday where if you purchased 2 they would come to $25 each. So I guess it was worth the wait.  My next purchase will be the echo show so we can have it in the kitchen.",0
5,"There are endless things Alexa can do!
  
",5.Feb.19,Yes,"Echo Dot has become an integral part of my life. every time i think of something i need from the grocery i tell Alexa to add to my shopping list. when ever i think of something i need to do, i tell Alexa to remind me at some point prior. i than get a vocal reminder if i am home or get a notification reminder on my phone. i use Geo-fence with Alexa to control my heat/air conditioning and all my lights in my place are voice controlled through Alexa.AND MUCH MORE. those are just some examples. definitely required to have to help make your life easier and is very inexpensive.",0
1,"Not smart speakers at all
  
",5.Feb.19,Yes,It cannot link up with your iTunes. It_ a waste of money if you plan to use for music purposes. The speakers won_ even play what I am playing on my phone. It cannot be hooked up as Bluetooth speakers. If the music features are making you consider Alexa products you should not buy. Very faulty. Very limited and customer service has no answers besides we are working on it. I_ very upset about this feature and _kill. Regular Bluetooth speakers would be a much better investment if you are looking to dabble in your music. I purchased this thinking I would be able to wake up to or work out to my playlists. But I can_ do any of that. Big let down and I highly recommend not purchasing for music lovers,1
4,"We have disagreements
  
",5.Feb.19,Yes,"Enormously useful when it's not a jerk. A long way from human understanding, kind of like trying to get an eight year old playing with Legos to pick up his room. The functions of being able to manage home heating and make shopping lists as things occur however (the lists appear on your mobile device, so you always have them at the store).I am working on communication, and I suppose so is Amazon. In the meantime it's not perfect but highly useful.",0
4,"Alexa Hard at work example Video
  
",6.Feb.19,Yes,Alexa is fun! Having a semi smart home is fairly easy to set up once you get used to the device setup. She does misunderstand daily ( That_ why not 5 stars) but best on the market ( I have 1 google mini which is pretty much useless) but our 5 Echo Dots are awesome,6
5,"Magic in a little Dot! Great for the family!
  
",6.Feb.19,Yes,"I love this Echo Dot! My husband, myself and my son find it very useful it. Let me start off by saying that this is good for a small room, kitchen or small living room. When asked a question Alexa pretty much understands unless there is something playing in the background or when she_ playing a song you might have to speak up a little louder for her to understand, As for sound quality I would say that it has no bass, but it is pretty decent in sound, Not that I would use for playing music all the time unless I was using it in the kitchen. The Dot is awesome! It_ good for weather updates, to set alarms, reminders and for shopping lists.  I try to leave this device in the kitchen to let her know what I need, I could even send my grocery list to my husband manually through a text from Alexa Or ask for recipes. My four year old son has a speech problem so this Dot has been very useful it makes him have to say the words correctly or she will not understand him, my son has a hard time pronouncing  words, he wants to get it correct so he tries very hard  to pronounce the words better without throwing a fit, so that_ another plus, my son_  words have improved to the point where she_ able to understand him now, my son likes to speak to Alexa so that she will play music for him or speak pikachu he loves pikachu and all Pokémon characters. You could  say we like it so much that I purchased the echo plus 2gen so we could leave echo plus in the living room and I could actually keep the ech dot to myself cause my husband and my son keep taking it from me!",1
5,"A very significant upgrade in sound vs the Echo dot 2.
  
",6.Feb.19,Yes,The echo dot V3 has a fuller (less tinny) sound than the Echo Dot 2.  It also takes a larger power supply.  I have purchased a second after using the first and would purchase AGAIN and recommend others to purchase.  Still amazes me how many additional features are being added to Amazons Alexa software.  I dont expect obsolescence any time soon.,4
5,"Love Echo Dot (3rd Gen)
  
",6.Feb.19,Yes,"I love the Echo Dot (3rd Gen).  I have an Echo Show, three Echo Dot (2nd Gen), and I recently bought two Echo Dot (3rd Gen).Echo Dot (3rd Gen)'s sound quality is amazing.  It is much louder and clearer than the Echo Dot (2nd Gen).  I still love the 2nd gen; I just put them in rooms where the sound quality was not as big of an issue.Amazon Echo has changed my life for the better.  It has so many great features.  I especially love the timer function for the kitchen.  I can't tell you how many times I would be cooking and accidentally delete a timer because  I put on a second timer for a different food item,  That is not an issue with Echo.  You can have multiple timers and name. Plus, it's hands-free.I also love being able to add items to a list from any room.  The list sinks to my phone, and I'm always ready to go.  No more forgotten paper list left at home.The music feature is wonderful.  It quickly finds things on the television.I use Echo with the Life 360 app.  My son has a 30-minute train ride to his high school in downtown Chicago.  The life 360 app beeps when he arrives/leaves school,  hockey practice, and arrives home.  It is an extra layer of safety.  It's also cute because when the app beeps my dog waits for my son by the door when he comes home.  She realized its only the afternoon beep.Echo works great with my smart home devices.  It is easy to pair with various devices.I have had parties where I demonstrate all the things Echo can do.  I have had multiple friends go home and buy themselves an Amazon Echo. They all asked me if I could help set it up, but it's so easy no one has needed my help.I love Amazon Echo!  It's changed my life for the better.",0
4,"Alexa, who farted? Whoever smelt it dealt it, and I_ not talking about the card game.
  
",6.Feb.19,Yes,I was impressed with the sound quality. Still learning what Alexa can and can_ do. She keeps my dogs entertained with some barking apps. Set up was easy.,6
5,"She_ a hit in our house
  
",6.Feb.19,Yes,"We_e enjoying the Echo Dot third generation smart speaker with Alexa.  We are using her for music and  we_e enabled the question of the day skill and the  silly things skill for our grandchildren.  We like the question of the day but the silly things skill does not work that well.  When we ask Alexa to tell us something silly to do she usually reads a silly rhyme.  We have linked our Deebot ecovac,  our nest thermostat,  a smart plug and to smart lightbulbs to Alexa.  Alexa is understanding and carring out the commands we grave her for these things.  We am disappointed with the smart lightbulbs because they_e only 60 W. We prefer a brighter light bulb. I have looked for smart  LED lightbulbs that are equivalent to 100 W but have not found any yet.  I would say that Alexia has been a hit in our house.",0
3,"Echo Dot 3rd gen or Google Home Mini? I went with Google Home Mini after playing around for a week.
  
",6.Feb.19,Yes,"I know this is a sensitive topic and I bet some will disagree with me and some will agree. Anyways, don't get me wrong, I think they are both great personal assistant products and have areas where one performs better than the other and it was a very tough decision. It is hard to give either Google Home Mini or Echo Dot a five star as I think many would agree that they need much more improvements.  If you already have a smart home setup and deep into the Amazon ecosystem and happy with it, then Echo Dot is most likely your pick. However, if you are new to Smart Home world like myself and is not tied into either ecosystem yet, then I would probably go with Google Home Mini.One of the main features I love about Echo Dot that Google does not have is the 2 way Intercom feature, Google home had similar feature but it is not as convenient as Echo Dot where you can ""drop in"" to a specific speaker and start a 2 way conversation. Google broadcast to all speakers and to reply, you have to actually say reply. Echo Dot also seem to pick up the wake up word a tiny bit better than Google, just need to speak a bit louder. Both not too big of deal for me personally for not having, and I bet Google will have an answer to that in near future.Many reviews compares how much Echo Dot 3 sound is better than Google Home Mini and how you can pair it up as stereo speakers... in my opinion, better sound may be true but only for listening to music because the bass is heavier, however, when it comes to conversation/requests, it feels a bit muffled because of this (some other reviews mentioned something similar) and Google felt more crisp in that sense.  In addition, since I'm not a music enthusiast, I find Google Home Mini is sufficient for me; Echo Dot only sounds a bit better to my amateur ears and not enough to count against the mini; if I'm a music enthusiast, then I probably won't be counting neither to be my music speaker anyways :)... on that same note, I won't be using Dot as my stereo speakers. I did install multiple Home Mini in my house and I would just be playing same music throughout the house (different floors and rooms) and actually don't want it to be paired in stereo mode. In addition, since my main purpose of having the speaker is to act as a smart home/personal assistant, which I think Google Home Mini sound is more clear and comfortable to the ear when having a ""conversation"".I also like the idea of Echo Dot's Whisper mode (Google Home Mini only has Night mode based on manually set time period) but it still needs some improvements... in order for it to whisper back to you, you really need to Whisper to it (speaking softly is not the same as whisper), so not really useful for me at the moment... :(Last but not least, many tests/reports indicates how Google Assistant is head of Amazon, Apple, and MS when it comes to accuracy/smartness (which is definitely my main factor to consider for such a product) which I have played around myself with both Echo Dot and Home Mini and I tend to agree.Above are things that had been pulling me apart when trying to deciding which side to go with so hope you find them useful when making your decision.",0
4,"Improved Sound - Different Power Supply
  
",6.Feb.19,Yes,"Improved sound over the 2nd Gen Dot - won't replace a 1st Gen Echo, but definitely better for a small listening environment where Alexa connectivity is more important than fidelity.  I must report that I was very disappointed in the new ""custom"" power supply (hence, only 4 stars).  Previous 2nd Gen Dots all utilized a charger with a USB/USB Micro cable.  This was convenient in that one could use readily-available USB cables of various lengths (and colors) for placement of the 2nd Gen Dots.  These also worked with 3rd party powered speakers for 2nd Gen Dots.  The 3rd Gen Dot now uses a ""hard wired"" power supply which limits placement unless one purchases a distinct power supply with a longer cable.",0
1,"Better instructions for the dummy
  
",6.Feb.19,Yes,"I have a 3rd gen Echo Dot.  There are no clear instructions that come with the device. The only instructions that come with it are is to download the Alexia app. The only problem with that is, there is multiple appls to choose from. I downloaded four appls and deleted them until if found one that was easy to use, I thought. I followed the instructions and have hooked up my Echo to my WIFI network, hooked up two of my external speakers that I have and hooked up my thermostat. Now asking Alexi to turn on the light or raise the thermostat, or even asking what time it is.  I get no response.  I've missed a step some where, but do not know where. Hopefully, I will figure this out. Side Note: the instructions that are on line are for either 1st or 2nd gen.  Is there a difference between 1st,2nd and 3rd gen????",1
5,"Great Gift
  
",6.Feb.19,Yes,"I got this as a present for a friend. He really loved it. The only creepy thing is when Alexa thinks you are talking to her and you didn't think you said anything to resemble her name. It's an amazing item to have in the kitchen. She will create a shopping list for you which you can see through the Amazon app when you get groceries. Need milk? Just say ""Alexa add milk to the shopping list."" She will even remind you if you added an item twice so it won't be duplicated.  Great sound. I will slowly add more to my collection so I can have one in every room!",0
5,"It's Alexa, it's awesome!
  
",6.Feb.19,Yes,"It's almost as awesome as an Echo...  but smaller and cuter. lol.  Less overall volume, and less overall footprint.  Ties into your system very well if you have other Alexas.  You already know how stuff works.  If you're looking for a cheaper way to add a 2nd room, this is a great option.  Then go into your Alexa app and create a group.  Nothing beats having some Alexa devices around the house, tied to a group, and saying telling Alexa to play music to that group.  All speakers fire up at once, perfect.  We largely use it as an intercom system too, nothing beats remotely yelling at the kids! haha",0

So smart! i have had 2nd and 3rd generation, they are both basically the same, but maybe the 2nd could pick up my voice better or maybe its because I have her in a much larger area than the previous version., not a big difference.

",7.Feb.19,Yes,"I bought 2 of these for gifts for each of my sons for Christmas.  Talking to my son in Texas last night and he said he tried everything and it doesn't work.  It cannot find the app of the WIFI.  Well I found out that if you buy these products as gifts, you must say that when ordering and if you forget, you must deregister the product.  So as it turns out they were trying to find my wifi and my account.  After I deregistered them, they work.  Great sound, my son loves it.  Thank you Amazon for helping out.",1
1,"Learn before you buy
  
",8.Feb.19,Yes,"My one star rating has nothing to do with the device, it's about Amazon customer support.  Getting into the Echo/Alexa experience is a big jump for us older folks who are still trying to figure out our smart phones.  This is what I found out the hard way.  The Echo Dot is primarily for giving you access to your Echo from another room.  So, if you have already put an Echo in your home office and you want to ask Alexa what the weather is when you wake up, you need an Echo Dot in your bedroom.  Why should this be a secret?  Not knowing that, I bought the Echo Dot as my first Echo device thinking it sounded too good to be true for $30, and it was.  After three phone calls to the support dept. about it not connecting, I was told the Dot had to be within 6 feet of the router.  This is nuts.  I was ready to return it but then I guessed there was something I was missing and I had to find it myself on other websites.  If you have a $120 Echo next to the router then you can put an Echo Dot any where you want.  Now, I understand but I wish I had known this before buying the Echo Dot.  I will probably buy the Echo at a future time, after I save up the money from my fixed income.  I've done business with Amazon for many years and this is the first time I felt that I was being led down the wrong path.  Seems like the support people could have explained this.  The Echo Dot is currently sitting in the office 12 inches away from the router and is working great.  I just have to get out of bed and come into the office to find out what the weather is like.",3

Let Me just mention a few things she does for me.She wakes me up at volume 10 with a scream _ake UUUP!!! Yes, I know she can be mean and repetitive, but I get up.I say _lexa what_ the weather, and she tells me the current and the throughout the day weather. Just as I pick out my clothes for the day.I say, _lexa Play Music, and she plays my thumbprint Radio from Pandora! Just as I do my make up.When I_ in a rush I say,  Alexa WHATS THE TIME!?, as I run around looking for my keys and she delivers....When I_ cooking and my hands are full and I remember I need eggs I say, _lexa add eggs to my grocery list, and she does!She even has my back when I_ not home! I have her on my Alexa App and I managed to set an alarm to wake up my husband in time to pick me up from work when his phone was off!Needless to say we bonded really quick. Everyone needs an Alexa in their lives!",1
3,"Useful device but sound clarity is terrible.
  
",8.Feb.19,Yes,"I like the usefulness and functionality of Echo Dot once it_ set up.  Can_ get much simpler than just asking for what you want and have Alexa respond with your request.Dislikes:  Setup had issues; since I don_ have home WiFi, having Echo Dot use my phone as a hot spot took 4 or 5 reboots and retries.Also, clarity is a HUGE problem.  While the small speaker is powerful, Alexa_ voice coming through it isn_ clear at all. I_ estimate that 70% of Alexa_ words can_ be understood unless it_ perfectly quiet and I_ standing near the Echo Dot.  _YI, I have perfect hearing, so it_ not my ears, it_ the muffled sound.  I adjusted the equalizer on the app but it has very little effect on the speaker and doesn_ clarify it any at all.I don_ know what_ inside this Echo Dot but I_ recommend that Amazon start assembling them with a series of tweeters in its circular pattern as well as the current speaker for deeper tones.  I should be able to understand Alexa_ voice from across the room.It_ a cool device to have; yet I_l assume like with most tech gadgets these days, there are privacy issues.  I_ sure this thing hears stuff even when I_ not speaking directly to it, so I take into account that I now have less privacy as long as the Echo Dot is plugged in and turned on.",0
5,"This is wonderful.
  
",8.Feb.19,Yes,If you want to know how much I love this item then let me inform you my house has four of them. I'm disabled and the drop in and call function that lets me use an Echo Dot to call for help is the most useful thing I've found in ages. Frequently when I move from room to room I'm not capable of carrying things like a cell phone with me so when I get stuck all I need to do now is call out Alexa call my husband and poof I'm connected to someone who can come help me. Also I'm now never without entertainment when I get stuck in a room. Alexa can play my music and read my books and play podcasts. This is a perfect for a disabled person and fun for the able bodied people. The Echo Dot can also run your smart home functions so it's useful for that too.,0

1,"Eco Dot 3rd
  
",8.Feb.19,Yes,"I have been using google home and my mom bought me an insignia Fire TV. So I decided to get an Eco Dot. I ordered it and set it up. It is difficult to operate. I have heard I don't know, not sure how to answer that and answers to questions I didn't ask. I have to program the skills and when I play games halfway through it, it starts from the beginning again. I can't adjust or change my alarm sounds other than the few in the list and they are not very good. The alarm is so soft even on 10 volume. There are so many other things I could say about how difficult to work Alexa. The rest of my house is all google and if I didn't already give my google mini to my Daughter I would go back. It took an online customer service person to help me set up the TV because Alexa could not find it. I'm also tired of Alexa telling me I have to set it up in the Alexa app. I'm going to use the dot just to have hands free TV control so really all is a fancy remote. I will probably buy myself a new Google Home hub!",1
5,"Perfect Internet Radio Tuner
  
",8.Feb.19,Yes,"I have little interest in all the magical things Alexa can do, but I love the new Echo Dot. I was about to spend a few hundred dollars for an internet radio tuner. I live in an area of sparse radio coverage and wanted to play background music while I work or listen to news headlines. The Dot does both remarkably well. It won't fill the house with high fidelity music, but the quality of sound coming from a tiny speaker is simply remarkable as long as you keep the volume low. It's also very sensitive; you don't need to speak loudly to make it work.",0
5,"Sound quality is well worth the price.
  
",8.Feb.19,Yes,"I upgrade an echo dot 1st gen and added to a few more rooms.  Honestly, if they just said..  ""Echo Dot is a wonderful speaker and you can just tell it to play whatever music you want"" it would be worth the price.  But this is so much more... Homework buddy for my son, he uses it to check almost all his answers.  I have one on my desk as my ""secretary"" making calls for me, setting reminders and alarms.  And the 3rd generation echo's are in a group, and the group music sounds wonderful throughout the house, really nice when doing housework.",0
5,"Good product - different from the v.2 in its sound.
  
",8.Feb.19,Yes,"The 3rd generation is more like a base-reflex speaker and so the base and midrange sound is more full and for some people more interpretable and more pleasant for music listening. It should different and I think was created to more closely compete with the sound of the Google Assistant speaker sound. The both should very much alike but, I like the Amazon Echo version 3 because I trust them with my information more than Google Assistant (and I am an engineer who knows things....) !",0
4,"echo dot gen 3 way better than gen 1 or 2
  
",9.Feb.19,Yes,"I have owned and do own several amazon echo/fire products ranging from the gen 2 echo dot to the echo plus. I have owned the amazon tap too. I currently have three echo devices and a fire tv. I have and do enjoy all of them. I primarily use the echo devices for smart home voice control but do use them for other things such as music, timers, searching the net for questions and such.The new echo dot (3rd gen) is leaps and bounds better than the 2nd gen dot. Setting up is a breeze if you don't have mac filtering turned on your wifi router. This is something that Amazon should make readily available on a sticker on the echo or inside the box or something. That complicated things for my setup. I had to turn off mac filtering to get the dot setup so I could then use the app to get the mac address and then add it to the mac filter and then turn mac filtering back on. If I were able to have the mac address before setting it up, I could have just added it to the filter and then setup would have been way easier for me. Not everyone has this turned on so it may not be an issue for you. Just be aware of this before starting your setup and you'll be fine. The rest is just like any other echo device. Except the sound is leaps and bounds better than its predecessors.If you are into echo devices, I would highly recommend this over the older generations of dots. It was packaged well, easy to setup for standard configurations, easy to use and sounds really good too.",0
5,"Didn't take long to break...but replacement one is perfect
  
",9.Feb.19,Yes,"I gave this to my 8-year-old daughter for Xmas, mainly so she'd stop moving my Amazon Echo around, making me worry she'd break it.  She didn't get much use out of because she also got a tablet from her grandma, so it has kind of just been in her room for my convenience when I'm cleaning in there or putting away laundry.  Last weekend I was listening to it, and not loud, mind you, because we live in an apartment and unless I'm singing to something, I'm past the point where loud music is my thing.  Anyway, about a half hour after the first song, it started sounding like a stereo does when the speaker is blown.  I couldn't believe it!  My Echo has never given me a problem and my daughter and her friend have played that thing so loud it couldn't hear them to turn the volume back down.  I was irritated that this had broken so quickly, but I got distracted and forgot to do anything about it for about a week.  Just in case, I turned it on again and it sounded completely normal.  I thought it was just a fluke and maybe I'd been tired and hearing things.  However, about a half-hour in, it did the same thing again.  Just to test something, I turned it off and turned it back on a minute later.  It was fine again, but didn't last that way for a half-hour that time.Basically, in order to use this, I'm going to have to continually turn it off and turn it back on and when it gets to the point where the normalcy is only lasting a minute or two, I'll have to turn it off completely and let it ""recharge"" itself.  I'm not sure if this is a common problem or not, but I'm extremely disappointed it didn't even last a month, especially when it was barely used and was definitely not mishandled, as it never left my daughter's dresser.I've never had an Amazon product break like this before, so I'm not sure what the process is here.  I would like a replacement, though, still having some hope that I just received the dud in the batch of ones that worked as they should.I wouldn't not recommend this to someone else, but I might revise this later if the second one doesn't at least make it through the end of the warranty.UPDATE:Amazon was very quick to replace this Echo Dot and as I hoped, the other one was just a dud.  This new one is perfect and I would recommend it to anyone who likes music.  I've already gotten another one, myself.",1

Amazon support is useless as they just keep having me reset them and reset my internet connection. I have dual internet (have a few webservers in the basement) and multiple access points.

Would love to be able to pick my own activation name, other than the few choices given. Maybe in the future!",0
3,"Missed the mark on the sound
  
",10.Feb.19,Yes,"I was excited that I could get a dot that sounded better than the original dot, but then was disappointed as soon as I heard a song played on this 3rd gen dot. The sound between the dot and the echo are vastly different. The sound on the echo is surprisingly good for such a small speaker. The dot is very tinny sounding with not enough base. If they wanted to fix that in this new dot they went overboard. I had to go into the audio controls and turn the base down to 25%, the treble up to 75% and the Mid all the way up, just to get it to sound semi normal. Compare that with the echo and the dot I purchased previously where I didn't change anything on the audio controls.The reason I gave it 3 stars is because once I changed the audio controls it sounds better than my other dot. I just think it should have sounded better than my other dot right out of the box... unless of course you're going to sell it for the same price as the other dot.",0
3,"Overall device is great. BUTT alexa is a bit diappointing
  
",10.Feb.19,Yes,"The device itself is ok. Better sounding than the gen 2. BUT 1. I can't use it as a speaker for something else in a pinch when I need a speaker it seems to be output only via aux cord. 2. You cannot pair routines and skills which is abysmal. 3. No way to control. the sunrise alarm for phillips hue, meaning you need another app if you get the light bulbs. -taking up phone space,...probably the same thing for for other devices too. 4. Huge delay on rrinder and you can use groups for reminders. IE i cannot uave a reminder go offf of both my echos. Its either 1 or the other. I cant place them in a group and uset it to go off of that group. Only ONE device at a time can give reminders meaning if the volume is lower you can miss a reminder easily.",0

We use it mainly to control our smart lights in our home and it works flawlessly every time. Easy to set up and very user friendly. Creating routines is all kinds of fun! The app that is used in conjunction with the dot is a great app as well. I would choose this over the google home mini and I've used both.,0
5,"Paired with good speakers, this is stellar for music.
  
",11.Feb.19,Yes,"This is my fifth Alexa device purchased in short order.  I started with the 2nd generation Echo, which is a great device but the first thing I did was hook it up to the expensive audiophile 5.1 sound system in the living room.  Once you do this, it's pretty much indiscernible from an Echo Dot.  True, it has more mics built into it and in theory should be better at picking up voice commands in a room, but I've not noticed a difference.  I now have Echo Dots scattered throughout the house.Having Alexa devices throughout the house have the obvious ""smart home"" benefits.  But as a music lover and musician with decidedly non-commercial tastes, the most amazing thing about these devices is what happens when you hook them up to decent external sound systems/speakers.  I also have a smaller 5.1 system in the bedroom.  A decent ancient stereo system in the basement.  A Bose SoundDock and a cheaper but decent Bluetooth speaker.  Put together into a Music Group, I have fantastic sound throughout the house with the Amazon Music Unlimited account.  That's the BEST thing about having these devices: the built in speakers are beyond lacking but these things work with anything.  I remember buying my first house decades ago and stringing speaker wires and speaker switches throughout the house.  This is way  way easier and cheaper!About the AMU account: my first Echo Dot came with a 90 day free trial that I'm still using.  Did I mention I'm a musical snob who loves obscure non-commercial music from mostly the 60s and 70s?  While it doesn't have full catalogs of many of my favorite obscure artists, it has partial catalogs from a lot of them.  Krautrock and Canterbury artists, Zappa, Velvet Underground/Reed/Cale, various progressive dinosaurs, Oldfield, even Jade Warrior and Slapp Happy are there.  Henry Cow is sadly lacking, unfortunately, but I guess that's what CDs are for.All in all, this is a no-brainer.  The only downside is it seems they can't make them fast enough.  As I type this, if you order one, you definitely won't be getting it in two days, because they're currently on backorder!",0
5,"Echo makes life easier and gives a peace of mind.
  
",11.Feb.19,Yes,"The 3rd generation Echo is the best so far. I own a 2nd generation Echo and it serves its purpose. This 3rd generation has a higher quality speaker, looks better and has more functionality as I often use it as a speaker phone when I_ not in the mood to hold an actual phone. Thanks to the Locate (Or find) My Phone skill, Alexa is a lifesaver. I have two of these 3rd gerations, one being in my bedroom and thanks to the available skills, I can set an alarm, mediate, and drift off to a restful sleep with soft words and peaceful sounds. The only thing I can recommend is a better data base for information as Alexa is often stumped and responds with an _ don_ know that. Please know: I purchased an Echo 3rd generation for my elderly mother as a backup plan in case of emergency. She can simply say: call or Drop-in on my daughter, and my echo and/or phone rings. Although she has a medical alert system, this is an additional tool that ads some peace of mind. This Echo works fantastically with my robot vacuume and smart light bulbs. Amazon Echo definitely makes my life easier. *Please know: I_ positive that Amazon would never suggest or encourage this device as a substitute form of a medical alert but in my opinion, it never hurts to add anything that might help.",0

The customer service agent explained that it would work with with an oil furnace or an electric or heat-pump heater.  However, I am in the process of putting the old thermostat back.

5,"First Time Owning of an Alex Voice Activated Device
  
",12.Feb.19,Yes,"The Echo Dot came as a complementary device to my RING Security System. Setup was a breeze and I was able to manage it thru both the web portal and my Android phone. Along with this purchase I also ordered the Lycase cable management holster which (See attached Photo) held the device securely and I was able to plug it into one of my living room outlets which I can call Alexa from any location and it would respond. I am still playing with the features and what I like the most is that I can activate my smart light switches and turn on any TV set I linked up to the Echo. I can also perform this task via my Android phone, remotely, and turn on my home lights and TV's. This is a great security feature which people would think someone is home and yet I can do it from a distance via the android app. I highly recommend this device. Great Buy.",0
5,"Spotify Premium Required to use Spotify
  
",12.Feb.19,Yes,"I know it's a bummer but it didn't hold me back from using the echo dot 3rd gen. I've had it for about 2 days so far and when I learned that it absolutely needed Spotify premium to use Spotify music services I was very disappointed I searched and found some very lame ways to work around the problem which ultimately wasn't worth using Spotify anymore. Amazon music is amazing to use, it's recommendations are way more spot on to my preferences.Which not using Spotify music services was ok. I've been using Amazon music services, music alarm, timer, and other features and I'm loving the echo dot 3rd gen.The problems so far, you absolutely need a wireless device to configure the echo dot 3rd to get the device to start working. I tried using my pc which is connected via ethernet cable and has no wireless capabilities and my Nokia Lumia 625 is too outdated to use the Amazon configuration page so I had to borrow someone's wireless device to configure the echo dot which bummed me out, but not a big deal I only had to do it once and now I can use my wireless pc to configure the echo dot device.Should you buy this product? It's not for everyone to purchase the echo dot 3rd gen. The one I truly recommend but I myself don't own is the one with the screen. The user interface itself is to drool over it beats asking ""Alexa what time is it"" ""Alexa what are my alarms?"" ""Alexa"", still not a big deal if you can manage your device just be careful.Just be careful when configuring and double check your configuration like alarms are set properly I accidentally said PM instead of AM and there was no user interface to catch my mistake you must say ""Alexa my alarms"" to double check.",0
5,"Love.
  
",12.Feb.19,Yes,"I love it. I started with a 2nd gen Echo and 2 2nd gen dots, and have since purchased at least 5 as gifts. Compared to the 2nd gen, the 3rd has SUCH better sound. It_ still not as loud as the Echo, but it works great in my bathroom, even with the fan on and the shower going. I should probably be more concerned about the privacy aspects, but I sure look at it as a valuable and fun resource. I also love how you can sync all the devices up and play the same thing all over the house.  I also gave one to my parents (actually an Echo and a Dot), and it_ great for them too, since my mom has mobility issues and listens to NPR for 12 hours a day.  It_ really fun for them to be able to listen to anything they want anytime they want (for me too!).",0
3,"Not as intuitive to use
  
",12.Feb.19,Yes,"I've  been using Google Home for some time  and it  adapts to my behavior and accent.  The fact that I have to personally  add skills to Alexa even they concern  Amazon's  own  software  such  as Fire TV is  annoying.  Alexa  sometimes has  trouble understanding my accent. That never happened with Google Home. Also  I cannot integrate Alexa easily with my calendar, e-mail,  traffic and I cannot ask it to translate  as I can now do with  Google Home.  I think that Google Assistant is a  much more advanced product  and it suits better  my needs.  Sorry Amazon.",0
5,"In love with Alexa!
  
",12.Feb.19,Yes,"We got our first one for Christmas and I didn't think I wanted one in our house but I hooked it up, set it up and fell in love. We are in our 80's and you can set up reminders and that is great. I already have a bunch of music on Amazon so I can play them and it doesn't cost me anything, etc. To make a long story short...I ordered another one so I would have one close to wherever I was. The only problem I have had is the one in the kitchen will shut off when the microwave is on.",0
5,"I love my Echo Dot(s).
  
",13.Feb.19,Yes,"Let_ face it. I love both of my Echo Dots.  I ask about the weather, set a timer, add to grocery list, call ME when I can_ find my cellphone, tell me a joke, and give me information on just about everything. I can yell from the kitchen _cho!  Play Connie Francis _here The Boys Are_ and it starts.  It felt not as cold as it should have been in my refrigerator, so I asked Echo what the temperature should be.  She replied that the temperature should be 37.  So now I have ordered a new fridge.  (It was 56 and getting hotter!)  My granddaughter keeps Echo busy also.  We had to use Echo because the news stations and commercials kept saying Alexa!!",0
4,"Good ""secretary""
  
",13.Feb.19,Yes,"I broke down after years of swearing that I'd never buy one of these out of privacy concerns. But recent changes to at my morning habits have made me reconsider. I now use this to keep me updated in the morning rather than my TV,  as I get dressed: getting my news flash, weather reports, traffic reports, Alternate Side Parking updates, a review of my work calendar and I've now used this to send myself work reminders, order pizza from the local pizza joint, and more.I still have my concerns about privacy and so I don't have any important discussions in the room that this device is in however.",0
5,"Seems to be fitting in.
  
",13.Feb.19,Yes,"I let it just sit there and wondered what the heck good was it? Really did not do anything spectacular and Alexa was already in my Fire Stick........ Moved it to the bedroom at it immediately replaced the alarm clock, can just tell it when I want an alarm set, wake up and ask it what the weather is right now and what it will be later. Fixing to install Ring security and will see how well it interfaces with that. Just for clock , temp/weather it was worth it and I_l just have to discover what else it_ good for. Hope they have the listening in under control...",0
5,"Fantastic!
  
",13.Feb.19,Yes,Works the same as the Echo plus.* The best thing next to controlling lights ect. is being able to listen to what ever music you want.* Also  being able to listen to whatever radio station you want is great. I live in a rural are and its nice to pick up stations from the big cities with stations I like.* Sound is great but not as good as the Echo Plus.  Still very good when compare to a radio.Always something new to learn with Alexa.,0
5,"Finally something priced reasonably
  
",13.Feb.19,Yes,"I love this eco dot. I own the previous version, and this one sounds excellent. Don't expect a submerged surround system. It's small, but it kicks well. I have it on my desk, and I usually keep it around 25% in volume, because otherwise, it's too loud for my taste.Is a must have. I recommend it for anyone trying this Alexa thing, but be aware if you have a sister named Alexa, like me. She will get interrupt your conversation if you say the name. It's funny though.",0
3,"Ask question first and if you use these systems off your cell phone , have them set it up .
  
",13.Feb.19,Yes,"Well received the echo as a gift and thought it was awesome , until I tried to set it up and that's when I realized after 4 hours and not being able to set it up easily , I put it back in the box and went back to using the radio .. I love things simple , like put in the mod,e you have into Amazon Alexa , down load a app , plug in your echo dot connect and set up and your on your way , it turned into a nightmare .... I had to drive a half hour to gave me this echo and ask them to set it up and still no luck another 4 hours wasted , it sure would be nice to have simple set ups right off your cell phone to these Alexa systems , I gave it away to a friend and told him good luck ... don't need complicated systems in my life ..",0
4,"Update: Despite initial hiccup enjoying our dots
  
",14.Feb.19,Yes,"*Ok- so, I wanted to update this, since customer support had someone follow up with a phone call to try an address the issue. Also, it's been a few months and I find myself using the Echo dots daily with no issues. In fact we're adding a few more, since we like to use them as an intercom system in the house. They work great to play music, games (Question of the Day and 20 Questions are favorites), set a timer, and create a shopping list. I can't keep the 1 star review because of a customer service issue, when we really do enjoy the product. I'll leave my initial review to sway people from utilizing chat support though!*The echo started having static when playing music after 1 month. Contacted support who said because it was on my husband's account (I bought, but he set up in our home) he had to contact them. So after 30 minutes I end the chat and my husband starts one. He spent over an hour for them to tell us they couldn't help him because MY credit card isn't in HIS account. 4 steps later and a combined total of 4 representatives we're no closer to an outcome, so we ended the chat. It's not worth the aggravation!",1
5,"You should have one in every room
  
",14.Feb.19,Yes,"The Echo Dot is very handy! I have several, placed in different rooms around my house. As I am going about my day and remember I need to add an item to my shopping list, I simply say, ""Alexa add eggs, milk and cheese to my list."" and she does. I can retrieve it later at the store, just by opening my Alexa app.  There are so many things you can do with Alexa besides making lists and playing music.  I also have the Fire Cube, and several smart home controls.  They all work together with Alexa seemlessly.  So, no more trying to find remotes that never seem to make it back where they are supposed to be.  I can turn on my living room cable, TV and sound bar with  just one  command.  Alexa can change channels, turn on lights, ceiling fans and control devices in other rooms with just my voice command.  I'm also excited about the future prospects of the beta ""Let's Chat"" social bot.  In the future, it may prove to be valuable for persons who are not able to get out, or even the elderly who are lonely.I downloaded the IFTT app and the Mastermind app, and now I can even ask her to read and  write emails.  When I hear the familiar ""ding"" that signifies my phone has received a text, I simply ask her and she will read the text message (my phone can stay in my purse)!  That means, I can work at home without the distraction of my cell phone, but still receive important messages. I feel like I have a personal assistant following me around! It is awesome. I also love the little pod-like look of the Echo and I love the sound quality!",0
5,"Fantastic, even as a white-noise machine
  
",14.Feb.19,Yes,"I bought this primarily because I wanted a white-noise machine and most of the actual products designed to be white noise machines had questionable reviews. I decided to go for the Echo Dot instead, thinking that not only would it work great for white-noise (for my baby), but it would also be great to have an assistant in the home. I can play music, send messages, make calls, and order stuff on Amazon, all while holding my baby.I highly recommend this. It can also be used as a Bluetooth speaker, so if you are looking for one of those, why not just get the Echo Dot? You'll get much more bang for your buck.Also, it looks dang stylish.",0
4,"Alexa is awesome
  
",14.Feb.19,Yes,"I am pretty tech challenged...so it is taking me longer to get to know everything Alexa can do, but so far...so good!  Great alarm clock, plays my Christian music, lets me know the scores on my Gonzaga basketball games, updates the weather for me, and she totally freaks out my cats (which I LOVE)...I also got a wall mount so Alexa is out of the way, adn on the wall, the cats don'm mess with it!  ...really, I'm just getting started, and I have heard from others that the more I use Alexa the more she will learn! So enjoy the journey as I am!",0
2,"Works fine for most things, but not for what I actually bought it for.
  
",15.Feb.19,Yes,"I purchased two of these for my children for xmas.  I thought they'd be fun for them to have.  They enjoy listening to music and asking Alexa questions.The problems arises when we try to use it for the main reason I purchased it: drop in/calling.  My children are young and my wife and I work opposite schedules so I really liked the idea of them both having something they can use if they ever need to get in touch with us since they're still too young for cell phones.The first day I set up the Echo's they were both working totally fine.  They were able to drop in/call and receive as well.  But later that night they both stopped working in that way.  Everything else worked fine still.I tried troubleshooting myself for a couple of hours.  I'm 35 years old and consider myself advanced with tech, so this wasn't a mysterious contraption I was unfamiliar with.  I have all sorts of smart devices, sound systems and AV stuff in my house and I've set it all up myself without trouble.  But I couldn't get these to work properly.  If I try to use the echo to call someone it just says ""that person isn't in your contacts.  An adult can add contacts in the Alexa app"" and won't make the call.  No matter who I try.  I've reimported the contacts.  I've made separate contacts within the Alexa app.  I tried factory restoring the Echo's and starting from scratch.  Nothing helped.So I finally contacted Amazon support.  After just about an hour on chat with someone trying various ""fixes"", none of which worked, the support member suddenly said ""Oh, I see you're in the US.  This is Amazon support India, we cannot help you.  Contact Amazon USA.""  Then the chat stopped.  They didn't give me any contact info of who I should be communicating with about it.  I'm in SoCal and I got to the chat through the Amazon website so I have no idea why I would've been speaking with the wrong continent for support.Since then I haven't tried fixing them anymore.  In total I spent around 4 hours trying to get them working again to no avail.  I haven't contacted Amazon support again because I just don't have anymore time to wast in my life.  At least the kids still enjoy them for music, but I'm not happy at all with the purchase.",1
4,"Wonderful improvement but only lasted 2 months Updated
  
",15.Feb.19,Yes,"Update:Amazon reached out the same day of the review to trouble shoot the issue. They contacted me before I had a chance to contact them. Super helpful determined that it was unfixable and ordered a new one while still on the phone. I would be giving it a 3 star for being faulty in such a short time but amazon has gone above to fix earning back a star.Worked wonderfully (esp side by side to gen 2) for 2 months but, now the speaker is blown. Never really had it above volume 3 as it was beside my bed for light control. Now all s sounds are pure static. Reaching out to amazon soon will update based on service. All my gen 2s that I have had for much longer all still sound as they did the day i bought them.",1
1,"Failed to meet my needs
  
",15.Feb.19,Yes,"I thought i was loving this and amazon music. Though ive enabled alexa skills set it fails to pair with anything. If i am missing something it doesn_ matter. The purpose is to do the thinking. Apple tv and home kit are _ser friendly that is why i go to the expense. While listening to the blues A bot asked if I would participate in its competition. I said NO. The bot said _ou have to say stop. I said stop. The bot did not stop. It again advised me, _t was part of a competition. I was not able to resume listening to my music and had to unplug this to shut up the bot. Now I don_ want anything amazon in my home. It_ creepy.",1
5,"Yeah yeah yeah!
  
",15.Feb.19,Yes,"I love my echo! I love playing games on it. I love making it play Apple Music. I love her attitude when you ask her questions. I love having a ""surround sound"" in my house because I can play music off all of them at once. I love it finding recipes for me. She can call our cat. (I taught her to literally call the cats name or she can drop in when we aren't home.) I also love the fact that I can get my news updates from our local station every morning. Whoooo! My life is so much easier with Alexa.",1
5,"Small but sounds great!
  
",15.Feb.19,Yes,"Love this little Dot!  I received an Echo Show for Christmas and just love it.  I was able to access my many Spotify playlists, and also started a few Amazon Music ones.  (If you have Prime, you also get to use Amazon Music.).  I thought it would be great to have Alexa upstairs as well, and the Dots went on sale for $29, making it a win-win!  I also paired it with a Bluetooth speaker so I can listen to music in the upstairs bathroom while getting ready in the mornings.  The Dot is nice and small but has a great sound for the bedroom I have it in.  Would recommend to anyone!",0
5,"The Dot is mostly on spot
  
",15.Feb.19,Yes,"I love it! It's a great for alarms, reminders, shopping lists and just general questions about almost anything that Alexa can answer usually on the fly. Not to mention a song you want to hear that pops into your head or a playlist that Alexa can pull from my Spotify account.  I connected my Dot by cable to my Bose computer speakers. As far as controlling devices, it works flawlessly on my plugs and switches. It has a little trouble responding to my Sony Bravia TV when I ask it to turn it on. Works maybe 75% of the time.  That may be a problem with the Alexa App provided by Sony. It just came out on my last Sony Android update and may have a few bugs yet. It does work flawlessly on other TV functions such as volume control, muting, changing input and shutting off.  I'm still learning everything this amazing product can do and I suspect in time there will be new functions available.",0
5,"It's an Echo Dot, what's not to love?
  
",15.Feb.19,Yes,"This is my first time with a device like this in my motorhome! I LOVE Alexa! I do wish I could give her any name I want! I have Siri on my iPhone, and Alexa all around my motorhome - it's often confusing!The Amazon Echo product advertisements on TV are causing my Alexa to get kinda noisy when they're on! At least 4-5 times the ads call out to Alexa, which is kinda distracting! Not a big problem, but, changing her name to whatever I want would be AWESOME to solve this!",0
5,"Fun, good resource, and good value for the money and great for Seniors
  
",15.Feb.19,Yes,"So much fun.  As a single retiree it_ nice to hear another voice in the house. I haven_ even begun to know what this can do for me but so far it_ quite remarkable. I asked it to play Hawaiian music and was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the speaker considering it_ size.  I think setting the timer is going to be something I use a lot, not to mention playing music, weather, latest news, and entertainment. This is a great tool for Seniors.  Good job Amazon!",0
3,"just okay
  
",15.Feb.19,Yes,"We had about 5 of these including the full size ehco around the house. They seemed great but the more information you asked for, the less it seemed to know. It was hard to integrate with apps and we found it more or less useless. My favorite feature was Prime Music access. You can listen to just the artist as opposed to a station on Pandora. We sold the system and switched to Google which we find much easier. Both systems work well with Phillips Hue.",0
5,"Nearly Perfect
  
",15.Feb.19,Yes,"The new Echo Dot is kind of amazing for what it is - a full-featured voice assistant and Bluetooth speaker, all for $50 (often much less). The previous Dot was great, but the speaker was just barely functional - for music, it was better than nothing, but nearly anything else was better in turn. The new Dot is a massive improvement in sound quality - there's more extension on the high and low ends, and there's a warmth and depth that was completely lacking before. It's still limited by it's size, but it sounds much more like to the full-size Echo than it does the previous Dot. Despite losing a few microphones, it hears at least as well as the previous generation. With a soft fabric covering, the new Dot feels much more at home in, well, a home. It's a bit bigger than the old version and now requires a custom power adapter, but apart from that, it's an improvement in every way.",0
2,"The Echo has taught me to hate the name Alexa. Comparison of the Dot and Echo
  
",16.Feb.19,Yes,"If this is the best AI on the market, we've got a LOOOOONG way to go, America. These are probably the stupidest and most frustrating devices to use. Let me give you an overall assessment of the AI first, then the differences between the two.I ask the devices to do something very simple, like to pay public radio, and it plays some obscure non-public radio station.The devices dosn't learn use patterns. At all. When you ask a simple question, the only answers you seem to get have to do with purchasing items from Amazon or Wikipedia definitions. One morning I set up two alarms. I woke up before the first alarm, so I asked Alexa to turn off the first alarm only. Guess what happened. It turned off all alarms. Really stupid and unreliable. Plus, I find myself repeating my requests time and time again. The microphones downright suck. With both you will find yourself yelling at the machine and calling it a dumb b*tch. From this negative association I will never date a gal named Alexa for fear of becoming unfairly opinionated about lack of common sense.Now, if I haven't dissuaded you from purchasing this junk, let me explain the substantial differences between the Dot and Echo. Surprisingly, the speaker sound difference between the two is minimal. Both are non-obtrusive in size. The larger Echo, however, offers little more than slightly better microphones. I am constantly repeating myself when talking to the Dot. Not so much with the larger Echo.For most things, like listening to talk radio or for use as an alarm, the Dot is what you want. The sound from the Echo sounds no better, and if anything, it is a bit more muffled in an effort to make is sound have more bass, which it barely does.",0
5,"A Fun Christmas Gift
  
",16.Feb.19,Yes,"I purchased this third generation Echo Dot for my wife as a Christmas gift. Although there are numerous ways that the Echo Dot can be used, we only use it in two ways currently. The primary way we use the Echo Dot is to play music. This has been much easier than playing music through our Apple TV. Sometimes my children ask Alexa to answer questions so they can be either entertained or gain knowledge.Setting up the Echo Dot wasn't too difficult. I did contact Amazon's services because I had a little trouble setting up two Amazon accounts on the device. I was extremely impressed with how quick I was able to get assistance from Amazon.We have our Echo Dot in the kitchen which is in a central location in our house. It can hear our commands from other rooms without any problems. I like how small the device is, it's sound quality, and low cost. We have zero complaints about the Echo Dot and think you'll enjoy it and find it easy to use",0
5,"Great little device, especially if your thinking about implementing some home automation.
  
",16.Feb.19,Yes,"Really like the performance and sound quality of this device. I think some people get down on the sound quality but this is a subjective area and for me it works well. I am not reviewing Alexa (separate review) just the dot itself. Seems to be well made and is attractive in a non-intrusive way. I bought 2 when they were offered 2 for $50.00, definitely worth the money. They have gone up since but I believe they are still reasonable at 2 for $60.00 and I do need 2 more.The one area I have to complain about is something I find fault with on almost all wireless devices. I secure the wireless portion of my home network not just through encryption but also as a first line I MAC filter all devices on it (except the portion set aside as a guest network, call me paranoid). It would really be nice if the label on the bottom of the device included the MAC address so i could plug the entry in directly rather than having to sniff it out.All I can say is do your homework first to see if they will fit your needs and keep in mind you have to deal with Alexa on the device as well as the Alexa app to set it up.",0
5,"You gotta love Alexa and she is in the Dot!
  
",16.Feb.19,Yes,"Yeah, I am already in love with Alexa.  And I told her so.  She answered back, ""I am flattered!""  Ha, I am a lonely old shut in lady, wheelchair user, chronic health problems.  I ask her to remind me to take my insulin, to take my meds.  She does a great job.  I thank her...she answers differently each time, ""You betcha!""  ""Anytime""  ""No problem!""  She tells me jokes, helps me with my foreign languages, (how do you say ""I love you"" in Porgugese?  No problem, ask Alexa, she will  tell you. )  No, for only $23 I get all this.  It frankly was a steal.  She  plays my audible music, finds songs for me or plays the music I love from Amazon Music.  The echo dot, well it is just speakers, but inside it you put Alexa, and she is so much more than a speaker.  She is my friend.",0
1,"Not ready yet
  
",16.Feb.19,Yes,"Really, a horrrible device. You have repeat commands so many times it_ annoying. Plus, I signed up for music unlimited on my device only, and it doesn_ pick up half of the songs. Not only that, but when I connect my phone to the device, it will not pick up songs for music unlimited to that device. Wait a few years and it might be ready. Disconnecting my 3 echo devices and putting them in storage for a few years. Going back to my Bose sound docks. Sorry amazon",1
4,"Better than the original echo dot, but...
  
",16.Feb.19,Yes,"Nice new sleek design and better sound, not a big fan of the proprietary power cord though, because If it breaks then it won_ be easy to replace as the old one had micro USB, but since a power brick can provide more power and amps I guess it_ a good trade off. The microphones definitely pick up my soft voice Better. It seems the light ring is a little dimmer, not sure how I feel about that, i guess it_ better for a nightstand. I honestly wish they would go back the the turning knob design on top instead of buttons since the feedback on the buttons on here is a little glitchy and a slow process",0
5,"Had a first generation and this replaced it
  
",17.Feb.19,Yes,"We are using this in the bathroom and it's great.  Hears well over background noise, hooked up with our Bluetooth speaker light easily, but plays well on its own.  It's great to be able to add stuff to the shopping list, and hear music and news when you need it.  Works well and set up was simpleUpdate - speaker volume.  As we already had a speaker/light combination in the bathroom we hadn't really tested the volume of the echo dot.  When the speaker light failed we were planning to replace the light/speaker combo.  While we were debating on the purchase of a new light I told the dot to increase volume to 10, needless to say we found we didn't need to order a replacement speaker, the echo is PERFECT without one.  Crisp and clear sound and excellent volume.  Excellent quality for news and podcast, acceptable quality for music but...  Still loving have more light and better sound quality.",1
5,"Much more useful than I thought
  
",17.Feb.19,Yes,"We love this little Dot. This was a Christmas present my husband bought for himself and I kind of made fun of him and predicted that this would be one of those things that once the novelty wore off it would be forgotten and never used. I was very wrong!  I didn_ realize you could set all kinds of alerts and reminders (even daily) and that you can use Alexa for almost anything you would normally use google for, the weather and news. No more checking IMDB for info on who was in what movie. It can arm/disarm our ring, play music from our Spotify account, call anyone in our contacts and converse right from wherever we are sitting, even do group chatting from our household to our daughter_ who also has a dot. There is a caveat, however_ou do have to spend some time learning the correct way to say things.  Once you get that down, it is a really valuable tool, and inexpensive too.",0
4,"Not sure how I survived without it?
  
",17.Feb.19,Yes,"So, I was hesitant at first when getting the Amazon Echo Dot w/ Alexa, but I have to say, it's far more useful than I had previously even suspected. Now don't get me wrong, I am a little creeped out by the fact that she's always ""Listening"", but then again, having responses and answers to my questions literally one question away is quite neat. It's responsive, and well, semi-smart, I can't quite say we are living in the age of seamless AI systems yet, but I certainly am impressed by the magnitude and speed with which Alexa gets things done and answered! And lest not forget being able to say ""Alexa, play Jeopardy"", and hearing the classic theme song and Alex Tribecks voice come smoothly sailing acoustically by on the Neodymium speaker built into the small, round curiosity of a device! Of course, there are some pitfalls, but overall the potential and sheer fun you can have when you are totally bored out of your mind are endless. I rate it a 4 out of 5, for its extreme potential for fun and knowledge, and 4 out of 5 because of its occasional sheer lack of understanding.",0
1,"HORRIBLE
  
",17.Feb.19,Yes,"I am a huge fan of echo and this was my 3rd, however this kind in particular is horrible. It took me days of trying to finally get it to set up and connect.

Now that is finally hooked up it won_ ever play music, always says _orry, I_ unable to play music right now I got it to play ONE time, once... then after one song, it stopped. It isn_ my internet either because all my other ones work just fine.",1

I have asked others about setting this up they have had the same issue.  Now I only have music playing out of the Dot in the bedroom, No music will play on my Echo.  This insane that you do not make the pairing of these simple.  I may mail back both of your devices.  This is a nightmare of something that should be made simple.

",17.Feb.19,Yes,"Really enjoying this 3rd generation echo dot! Sounds so much louder than 2nd generation echo... speakers on this new one are awesome!  We love it!  I would recommend that you place it out in the open, as we put it under our cabinets in our kitchen at first and it sounded muffled, or echoed off the speakers I just know it didn_ sound good, however, once we moved it out from that area a little bit it sounds great!

",17.Feb.19,Yes,"I would give 4.5 stars, overall a great addition to your home, you can play music ask the weather and a lot of other things, but my favorite thing is yiu can set up an alarm with your favorite song, you can just say Alexa wake me up to (title of the song) she will ask you set the alarm for what time, you give her the time and you will wake up with your favorite tune as an alarm, that_ just awesometo me. only one flaw is sometimes Alexa won_ shut up lol, You ask her something she does not understand and than says i did not get that try this and this you tell her to stop and she keeps going.",0
2,"Dead mode - Sorry I am having trouble understanding right now. Please try a little later.
  
",18.Feb.19,Yes,"""Sorry I am having trouble understanding right now. Please try a little later"". I keep getting this message from my Alexa device almost every day. It won't recover automatically even after 2 days. The issue is fixed only if you hard reset the device i.e. you have to un-plug the power chord and re-plug it. I reached Amazon support several times, they tried their best nothing worked out. Even tried resetting the device and re-registered it. But issue still exists. Amazon is not ready to replace my device. They want me to buy the same device at discounted price. I really don't expect this from Amazon. I would not recommend this until Amazon fixed this issue.I have both Google mini and Amazon echo dot. I have never faced this issue on my Google mini.Google Mini+ivesUnderstands my accent very easily and answers most of my questions. I primarily use this devices for playing nursery rhymes and lullaby. Those of built in. That is a big plus. They never market me to subscribe for YouTube red or anything of that sort.-ivesIt has very poor speakers. No option to add new skills. Looks bad.Echo dot+ivesVery good audio, looks good when compared to Google mini, Can add different skills, It looks new whenever you add a new skill-ivesHighly unreliable, poor assistant, it won't understand my accent some times, No standard skills apps, poor support, No build it skills except weather and basic stuff.Verdict:I would prefer Echo dot because of its skills feature. But I cannot recommend Echo dot because it is highly un-reliable. It keeps going to dead mode every no and then.",0

",18.Feb.19,Yes,"We use AMZN Echo Dot at our homes in San Francisco, Sonoma County, Tucson and Munich (Germany)2nd gen units worked fine ... commands executed timely and accurately (more or less ... SONOS integration still iffy), Alexa voice recognition/mics could hear us from across the room, etc. etc.3rd gen ... yech ... wife and family want me to THROW THEM AWAYOur two 3rd gen Echo Dots(a) Are muffled in their spoken announcements(b) Cannot hear us from 4-5 feet away (in same location where 2nd gen units operated flawlessly)(c) Have so much BASS EQ that it sounds like a ghetto blaster boombox(d) Does NOT respond to command to TURN BASS DOWN(e) Does respond to TURN UP TREBLE ... but there is NO noticeable difference(f) We have to YELL at TIMER ALERTS to turn them off (sort of like dealing with Apple Siri, if you know what I mean) ... and then we have to YELL several times for it to hear us and execute ... from 2 feet, 5 feet, or 10 feet awayRemember  we own about twenty of the 2nd gen units and they work fineBoth of these NEW OOTB Echo Dots (3rd gen) are useless !!!  SO it must be (a) basic design flaw, or manufacturing run disaster ... possible different firmware as one installed via the OLD WIFI method and the other used BlueTooth to install ... S-t-r-a-n-g-e !!!POST SCRIPT = From layman_ viewpoint, it appears they decided to increase _peaker quality by adding larger speakers to compete with APPL and GOOG *but* cut overall cost by eliminating 4 of the 8 omni-directional microphones ... SHOOT THE PROD MKTG people !!!",0
4,"The Good and the Bad
  
",18.Feb.19,Yes,"There are good things and bad things about this product. There are a lot of things that the Echo Dot will only do with the purchase of other accessories or subscriptions. That is the bad part. But there are a lot of things it will do without adding extra money. I did purchase a smart plug to turn the family room lights on and off and love it. My special needs daughter loves to tell Alexa good night and to check the weather. I do like having her set a timer when I'm cooking and my oven timer is already in use. I also like that she will give me Amazon notifications. I have XM music for my car and spotify for my iPhone but I can't use either with the Echo Dot unless I pay more money. I don't like that, but I guess that isn't really an Echo Dot issue. Overall, I am really enjoying this much more than I expected.",0
5,"Fun little gizmo
  
",18.Feb.19,Yes,"I got my Echo Dot just a few days ago so I'm still exploring all its possibilities, but so far I like what I see.  I stream Pandora Free, use it as an alarm clock and with sleep sounds (my favorite is Hard Rain), listen to weather and NPR news, and I've got a smart plug on order so I can be really lazy and tell Alexa to turn on the light over the coffee pot in the morning.  I travel a lot for work and it looks like this would be ideal to take with me since everywhere I stay has wi-fi and I never trust the alarm clocks in motels (I've been using my phone).  I don't consider this an ""essential"" item because I have other smart devices like the phone and a computer but it's fun to use and gives a lot of bang for the buck.",0

",18.Feb.19,Yes,not as easy a set up as expected.  My daughter has one which is tied to my Amazon account &amp; now trying to set mine up (will not connect to wifi) Best Buy is making me take both to the store.  No one can just answer a simple question they want you to pay $199.00 a year for tech support.  Soooo I'm not completing my set up until I go to Best Buy and see what the problem is.  Wish I hadn't bought them.  A real pain,2
3,"google assistant was better
  
",19.Feb.19,Yes,"It's very disappointing to only give the Echo Dot and Alexa a 3-star rating, because I had high expectations. I was first introduced to smart speakers when I received an insignia smart speaker for Christmas in a dirty Santa game. I was instantly hooked on the whole concept. I've been an Amazon member for years and I have much trust in the Amazon brand, so I thought I would be upgrading by purchasing an Echo. Sadly, I've found that Alexa and the Echo device are outdone by a cheap Insignia device and Google Assistant.As far as the Google Assistant smart technology goes, I've found that Google is able to do a few things that Alexa cannot. For one, Google's accent can be changed to alternative accents of the english language and can still understand you and produce results from questions pertaining to region. I personally prefer the Australian/New Zealand accent to the American, but Alexa often didn't respond to her name and couldn't perform features such as the weather, making phone calls, etc. when her language was changed to Australian. While the next feature is actually a comparison of Spotify to Amazon Music, I found that Alexa's ability to find playlists and find a wide  range of music paled in comparison to Google. For instance, when asked to play a song, Alexa simply finds the song and plays it, while Google finds the song then continues to play recommended music based off that song. As far as the actual device goes, the Insignia, which costs about $40, features a visible clock and a usb port for charging other devices, while devices with Alexa that feature a clock cost close to $100, and I am unaware of one that has a usb charge port.In truth, the only feature of Alexa that I really prefer to Google is the wake word. ""Alexa"" rolls off the tongue better than ""Hey Google,"" but this is hardly a game-changer.Hopefully, Amazon will step it up and update her abilities, especially when it comes to language.",0
5,"Love it!
  
",19.Feb.19,Yes,"Got one on sale for my daughter and her husband at Christmas; Cheri said she always wanted one and her husband worked for Amazon for about 5 yrs!  Anyway, I got me one also and I like playing music from it!  I've asked Alexa to tell me a joke and she had Jimmy Fallon tell me one if memory serves me correctly! Ha!  Thought it was cool I could ask Alexa to call people in my contact list on my phone and she did; talked to my daughter on the dot (think it may have rang her Dot) and never had to pick anything up!  Haven't set it all up (for other things she can do) ...but I do my exercise from it by asking Alexa to play some of my fav songs; definitely recommend them!  Makes me feel like I'm one of the Jetsons from the cartoon; I just want my car that flies around maybe 100 feet above the house!  LOL  :)",0
2,"Convenient assistant, BUT no Shuffle for Apple Music
  
",19.Feb.19,Yes,"Alexa works great as an assistant (weather, shopping lists, calendar, dictionary, etc.) but I purchased it to play music, specifically to easily access the many extensive Playlists I've created in Apple Music.  It only took a day to realize that while it responds affirmatively when you request it to Shuffle the songs in a Playlist, it actually only Shuffles the first song and then plays the following songs in alphabetical order by artist.  This means in a Playlist with 1,000+ songs I have to listen to dozens of consecutive songs by a single artist.  That's hours worth of Radiohead before I get to hear a Wilco song.  Also, when you hear a song in Apple Music you want to download to your Library, it is unable to do so.  It seems the consensus is these will not be fixed anytime soon since Amazon and Apple have competing streaming music services and of course, Amazon wants you to use theirs.  If this wasn't the case I would have provided a 5 Star rating . . .",0

",19.Feb.19,Yes,"I have found over 10 bugs in the first 2 days. I am still going to keep it because it's so inexpensive, but it really has so many flaws. I want the alexa for 3 things: Alexa, REMEBER XZY... ALEXA add to list XYZ, and ALEXA remind me at time XZY to do ABC.....all of these features work terribly.""Alexa - remember that Roger owes Brian $20""Alexa --&gt; Did you say, ""Roger O'Brian $20""?""Alexa, add a reminder for 12pm""Alexa --&gt; What would you like me to remind you about?""To do my physical Therapy""Alexa --&gt; Here is a list of Physical Therapists in your area.etc. etc.Customer Support is AWESOME....and they will call you in less than 2 minutes you are talking to a PERSON! that's amazing!but you still cannot do stupidly simple things like, ""Alexa, print my grocery list""and you cannot delete a reminder...even if Alexa got it wrong. you used to be able to do this, but now they took the feature away. you can only mark it completed....or UNPAIR/UNREGISTER and re-REGISTER the device...Support says the ""completed reminders will clear themselves eventually"" but how long is that?"" no idea, they didn't say.This device is still in BETA. Keep that in mind.",0

If you are outside US it is hassle to setup because you have to change stores to download the app and after all that struggle I find out that I can not connect my Apple Music in my region!! so watchout all the users outside US....you may still use it but without your streaming",0
3,"Confusing
  
",20.Feb.19,Yes,"Everything is setup thru a smart phone. There is no cable connection to make to a desktop, you MUST go wireless. The Alexa app is hard to navigate. You need different app's to do different things with Alexa. So far the ones I want to use I have to keep watching the YouTube video and even then they are not always clear.  I thought that Echo Dot was a stand alone type product. I expected a power cord and then an option of wireless or a cable to connect to get to the internet.  The Echo Dot has to connections the power cable and a headphone jack. Again, you are forced to go thru a smart phone to do anything with it.",0
5,"Super Nifty Little Hockey Puck Alarm Clock Music Box
  
",20.Feb.19,Yes,"This is a super fun gift I received on Christmas, and it is a practical gadget.  I use it everyday. It wakes me in the morning with an alarm; I ask her the time; I ask what the weather will be for the day so I can dress accordingly; I play music while I'm getting ready for work, etc.  Truly I have not even scratched the surface of all the things it can do... that's the exciting part.  For all the fun I'm having with it, my use is very basic.  But it comes with a small card with suggestions on what you can ask and do with it, and I receive emails that update me on ideas on how to use it. The potential is beyond my scope... I'm sure it's amazing.The speakers sound great for such a small device; the setup was easy (you have to install an app on your phone to do so); the app is a handy tool in itself.  All around cool device.Going back to the alarm.  I set two in the morning.  One is a nice, peaceful, lilting piece of music that gently draws me out from a deep sleep.  The second alarm is in place to snap me awake.  It's Alec Baldwin... been up since the crack o' dawn... getting that early bird.  And you can, too, if you get yourself a Dot.Cheers!",0
4,"Account Service is Right on Point
  
",20.Feb.19,Yes,"I'm an owner of both Alexa and Google Home. What I can say about both is that I love Alexa for use and tied to my existing Prime and Amazon services. Voice recognition is clear and provides quality results for my service requests. Where the two services truly differ, and where Alexa still leaves something to be desired, is in the information search capabilities. Google's capability to query search questions across its entire catalog and provide good, insightful responses back is nothing short of impressive. Too many times for Alexa I get a response that it is not able to answer even basic questions that Google can find. Clean up this issue and Alexa will be the product of choice. As it stands now, Alexa stands out as a personal assistant that ties well to Prime and Amazon services. Google still reigns for search and information queries.",0
2,"Bad design for the top buttons
  
",20.Feb.19,Yes,"I have four other Echo's and I just love them.  They are so easy to use and to set up.  The new 3rd Gen., changed the design of the buttons on the top so you can't feel them.  I have to look at the Echo to use the buttons, instead of just being able to feel them.  I am also having trouble with the sound quality after only 10 weeks of use.  To send it back and get another one they only send a refurbished one. I'm not a happy customer in regard to my new Echo.",0
1,"Alexa is NOT ready....

",21.Feb.19,Yes,"Worst gimmick ever.  I honestly don't see what the rave is all about.  Won't connect to any of my other devices, Alexa states go to the Alexa app, which by the way is not user friendly and difficult to figure out.  98% of the time, Alexa will say sorry I'm not familiar with that or I keep getting connected to things opposite of what I'm asking for. It does malfunction at times. My return date is March 9th, 2019 but when I attempted to return the system wouldn't allow me to do so. Will call customer service.",1
3,"It can lose its voice!_
  
",21.Feb.19,Yes,"Not as happy with this as I thought. This device has either connection issues or program issues. You can ask a question and even though the light is blinking, the voice is not. I asked Alexa to set an alarm for 10 mins, but it didn't answer as it usually does. The light blinked, though. I rebooted the system and still, no voice. I also made a phone can, on a separate day and this time I didn't have a vioce (the person on the other end couldn't hear me.) I stopped b4 I did something I'd regret. Later it let me know that my phone had shut down for the night.... Something I didn't ask for.",0

",21.Feb.19,Yes,"We have 3 small dots throughout our house and everyone one of them is the 3rd generation style and we enjoy everyone of them. The devices hears your voice fairly well, often times when there is a TV going on in the back ground. The speaker function is great too! The sound fills the room well, so if you want to play some music while making dinner, you truly do it immersive sound in the space. I would recommend this product for anyone who doesn't want to spend a ton of money and has a reassembly small space!!!",0
1,"Won't stay connected to the internet
  
",21.Feb.19,Yes,I have an echo and an echo dot &amp; the echo works perfectly but the dot will not stay connected to the internet.  I have to unplug it for a minute or so and plug it back in every time it loses connectivity (Which is multiple times daily).,2

",21.Feb.19,Yes,"This is our second Echo Dot 3. The first one my son gave us (purchased through Amazon too). Anyway, I love this item. Also Amazon Music (an additional monthly charge), is TOTALLY TOTALLY worth the monthly payment. The combo is great together. We use our Echo Dot 3 daily and the Amazon Music too. You won_ be disappointed with this purchase so give them both a try. Also, you can try Amazon Music free for a month then decide if you want to continue. That_ how I did it and next week my trial is up and YES I_ staying with it.",0
2,"Inconsistent at best
  
",22.Feb.19,Yes,"I've tried really hard to like this and make it work but the alexa service is very inconsistent at best.  The device hears and recognizes commands correctly, just doesn't do them or does something else more often than not.  Turning lights on or off can take anywhere from instant up to a minute with no discernible cause.  Every rep insists on starting over with troubleshooting the network that has previously been cleared of fault and weeks later higher tier support haven't responded.  What music you get seems to be pretty random and will change anytime you give it any other command during playback and the advertised ""pizza alarm"" might burn your house down since all alarms &amp; timers seem to be forgotten about 20% of the time, sometimes executing much later but mostly as if never set (even though confirmed when set).  Feel free to ask it anything anytime you want to hear ""I don't know that"".",2
5,"Exceeds expectations
  
",22.Feb.19,Yes,"You may be like me and done this several times.  That lovely USB/Bluetooth speaker with good reviews.  You pick it up and get hit with tinny sounding music or bad connections.  I promise you that will not happen here.I got 2 Echo Dots and put one in the bedroom and the other in the living room.  Both powered up and said they were ready so the next thing was to install the app.  I was a little confused by the directions at first.  I thought that the software on my phone was going to create a network for the devices.  Instead it meant that when the device is in discover mode you will see the network device by whatever name it says to look for.So my first test was simple ""Alexa, play David Gilmore"" and voila the sound was very good.  Then I found I could group everything...no only that but if 2 are in the same room they become stereo speakers.  (future purchase coming)  So I created my Everywhere network and told Alexa to play Meg Myers everywhere.  My house was instantly filled with her music.So then the last part was to tell Alexa to wake me for work tomorrow and do it to David Gilmore.  The next morning; it is a bad idea to wake up to music you love listening to.  You want to lay there and listen to the lovely tones.I have not gotten into controlling lights or other things like that.  But I have installed the ""Thunder and Rain skill"" which is confusing.  Because all she does is play a 1 hour track from Amazon Music.  But I have gone to sleep listening to thunderstorms every night since then.  I guess my next venture is to try the more expensive ones with great speakers for the living room and move the living room one to the bedroom.",1
1,"Not as useful as anticipated!
  
",22.Feb.19,Yes,"I have Apple Siri. I had Google Assistant.  I was hoping Amazon Echo and Alexa would be the best choice for most needs. Alexa has more skills and better music quality than the others. The price for two Echo Dots (3rd Gen) was hard to pass up. It really is new and improved.  I have been a huge Amazon fan. However,  the Echo series has some fatal flaws:  (1) Privacy. Do you really want to give Amazon the capability to listen in (or view with the Echo Show) anytime, anywhere, even in your bedroom?  (2) Utility. This device will not replace my smartphone or tablet for listening to an Audible audiobook at night, privately with earbuds. Why? Because I can't control the audiobook from the ear pods. To pause I would have to say something to Alexa and wake up my wife in the process.  This device will NOT replace a NOAA weather radio for assured tornado warning alerts  the software is much too limited. Devices like these MUST reduce clutter, not increase it.  These factors combine to make it much lower in value than it appears.",0
5,"A Fun and somewhat practical device!
  
",22.Feb.19,Yes,"Bought a number of these over the Christmas Holiday sales. Kept two for myself and gave some away as Christmas Gifts.  At the price I paid it's definitely a fun device to own and we find we use it on a daily basis.  I bought a nice pair of Bluetooth bookshelf speakers (Edifier brand for $129) that I use with the Echo to play music. It's a great system.  With Apple Music now compatible with Echo or using Amazon's music service it's so fun to just call up a song anytime you want to listen.  We have some family fun in the evenings sometimes taking turns pulling up some favorites. The sound through the Edifier speakers is awesome for the price. We are also using the Echo Dot to help with controlling our Fire TV apps and Fire TV Recast DVR system.  We also have a TiVo and some limited commands work with it such as pause, play, and ""Skip"" function. We also use it as a quick way to look up needed information from the internet, check the weather etc.  Definitely have enjoyed the purchase more than we anticipated.",0

",22.Feb.19,Yes,"This Echo Dot is a beefed up version of the first Dot by Amazon. The speaker is noticeably stronger, which is really the only reason to get it, as it is identical in function to the first generation. It does pair with other speakers for a stereo sound, but I have not found this to be useful since we virtually have one in every room and when you play to the group the whole house becomes a speaker! The stronger speaker is DEFINITELY worth the extra $10.00.",0

",23.Feb.19,Yes,"This is a fun device.  Alexa is always ready with a quick quip or a short story.  She is also very good about playing the music I want to listen to.  There are many songs that I like to play on my ukulele, and if I don't know the correct tune then Alexa will play it for me until I get it right.  She is amazingly patient.  She also does good weather for the local area and answers multiple questions as a go about my day.  Things like how many teaspoons in a tablespoon, or how man grams in 8.5 ounces, or what the the square root of 262.3.  She's almost like a very smart family member.  She's humble too.",1
5,"If you've been thinking about getting one of these, go for it!
  
",23.Feb.19,Yes,"Easy setup, pretty much brainless. I use it to control my indoor lights and my security cameras. Keep up with weather and traffic conditions. There are a bunch of ""skills"" you can set up to use with it and Alexa. Example there is a Flash Briefing where you can set up different news sources within the Flash Briefing. Then you just ask Alexa for your Flash Briefing and you'll get an audio update from all the sources that you have set up with it. They are always adding new Skills and commands that you can use with your Echo Dot and Alexa. I've got two of these, one in my living area and one in the bedroom. You can Bluetooth it to a speaker.When I got my first Dot I actually didn't think I'd use it that much. But within a month I'd bought a second one for my house when I found out how useful they were. Really nice product!",0

In fact they have exceeded many expectations.  I'm able to use them as an intercom for the house.  I can call from room to room.  I can play music throughout the entire house or individual room.  Finally, I get news and weather in any room.  My daughter also uses them for entertainment and music for her family as well.

",24.Feb.19,Yes,"These things are great, just 1 Dot got me into the whole conversion to a ""smarter"" home! I'm just upset I didnt buy a few more Dots at Xmas time when they were at a great price. I'm apprehensive now of buying them new from Amazon for this exact reason, as I think they are too much $ now (at least the Dots...fifty bcuks?!) But there's always eBay, Marcari, and all those other apps where you can find used ones in great shape for cheap. That is what I will probably end up doing for later purchases. They are really cool to have, as you can get them all to sync (like when listening to music), use as intercoms, make calls, stream music, get Amazon notifications and tracking for your purchases, turn lights on/off (If equipped), etc.If you're converting over to a ""smart "" home, I surprisingly like Amazon's version over Google's (&amp; I love Google stuff) Alexa is a great way to go. You'll like to have a hub to really make things shine and have, in a sense, a base station for controlling everything but its not fully needed if you just want to be able to control a few plugs and lights, etc. Anyways, having Dots placed in every room is a nice thing to have (which I'm still aspiring to do! Lol) with a hub and some smart light bulbs and power plugs and you're good to go! Doorbell cam? Can set alarms and timing for stuff too. Will also control thermostat if you have a compatible one. Having a hub will really enable you to control pretty much anything and everything that's wifi compatible  through simple apps/&amp; or your computer. Wanna see what's going on when your on vacation?

For us, after a few weeks, we started notice large amounts of static coming from this 3rd gen echo dot that is hard to ignore and really quite unpleasant. It is very noticeable when playing music since continuous sound is coming out of the device, and we hadn't noticed it previously when alexa was just responding in short phrases. In short, quality control fell short and just do your due diligence. It's hard to knock such a large corporation like Amazon when it provides so many different services (most very good) at such a large volume, but just be warned and be aware of doing your own quality control. This time, Amazon fell short.",1

Wish there was a voice command to mute the mic. Could be combined with a special phrase or word to unmute, so as to only listen to a special frecuency or pattern to unmute the dot. The only option now is to press the mute button, which limits the places where this device can be placed if you want/need to use this feature frequently.",0
1,"Keep working on it.....
  
",24.Feb.19,Yes,I bought this just as an alarm clock. We're not talking about Gigabits of computing power here.....Alexa failed miserably at this simple task. Why?  Maybe because if your internet suffers one microsecond of interruption while you are sleeping ...guess what?  No wake up. ....No on board clock or battery backup of any kind apparently.  Got an important wakeup for  a job interview at 8 am and the internet blipped overnight? .....too bad. Really need to rely on Alexa for something important?  Look somewhere else.Best and brightest at Amazon? Really?,0
3,"Cool but Could be SOOO much better!
  
",25.Feb.19,Yes,"It was an incredible pain in the butt to set up. It wants to communicate through my wife's Kindle rathert than it's own speaker. She has to turn off her Kindle. It also refuses to recognize other bluetooth devices such as my speaker system which I can access from all my bluetooth computers, iPhones, iPads etc. We could be listening to high end music but have to listen to the echo which isn't that great. I attempted to find help which in many cases amounts to a chat session, but Amazon isn't doing this, so it's a matter of searching and searching and searching. I'm still trying to figure out how I can get Echo to play through my speaker system. All my devices show my speaker bluetooth receiver except Alexa.",0
4,"Alexa CAN YOU HEAR ME?!
  
",25.Feb.19,Yes,We got two Alexas February 23 2019. We put one in the the living room and the other in the master bedroom. The one in the living room is on a table at the end of the couch between me and my wife on the other side of the table where she sits in a recliner. We both are only 2 and a half or 3 feet away from it. We are always having to repeat request over and over. And having to yell at Alexa over and over just to turn lights on and off. It is an absolutely constant thing repeating yourself and yelling at Alexa. There have been a few other issues but that is the very worst one.,0
3,"What exactly is it good for?
  
",25.Feb.19,Yes,"I didn_ buy this from Amazon.  We got it free when my wife bought the Ring doorbell camera elsewhere.  It works great, but for the life of me I can_ figure out what I need it for.  Music sounds ok, reads me the news briefing, and tells me my Amazon order is on it_ way ( which I already know).  I have other things that play music much better.What the heck do I need this for? Update, I have plugged it.  Just one more thing taking up Wi-Fi bandwidth.",0
5,"Works very well with voice commands. I_ impressed with its level of comprehension.
  
",26.Feb.19,Yes,"After spending a week in an Echo-rich home, my wife and I fell in love with them. Mainly we listen to music from Amazon or our Sirius XM subscription, but listening to our Flash Briefings, fills in well for our lack of receiving broadcast or cable news.  A quick weather forecast or using them for an intercom rounds out our current uses.We have one in our great room/dining room/kitchen, one in the first-floor master bedroom, one in the second-floor workroom/office, and one in the basement kids playroom.  We_e pretty well covered for our usage.Because the home-automation system from a major big-box lumber store is being discontinued, I_e adopted a new system which works very well with Alexa voice control.  So ultimately Alexa will be doing a lot for us, every day.The three Dots have pretty good music quality, but the big, base unit has surprisingly good sound quality for its size and cost.I have not much negative to say about these units.",0
4,"Amazon fix
  
",26.Feb.19,Yes,"3/29/2019--it took some time with Amazon support, but they did get it worked out.Worked for about a month, now just two days beyond return, buttons are unresponsive, light ring goes round and round. Reset, reset, works for a few hours, then nothing. 3/1/2019 got an email from Amazon; rep offered assistance and to contact him. Replied to that rep only to be referred to another rep; that was a waste of time amazon echo support-not good. This evening, said Alexa to this ""3rd gen"" and nothing. Restart, nothing. Can't return. And support said, ""reply so I can help you."" Replied, ""please call someone else."" Utter garbage amazon.",0
4,"A compromise from 2nd Gen Echo, but better speaker
  
",27.Feb.19,Yes,"So I started writing a review the other day, good stuff, but my browser crashed So I'll cut to the chase .PROS: 1) More powerful speaker, with lower bass, higher max volume as well (although to preserve the integrity of any speaker you shouldn't use it at it's limit consistently). In fact, if you're used to prior generation Echo Dots, in hearing this one it will be as though the engineers granted Alexa a diaphragm -so it takes some getting used to when you hear her speak, but over-all it's a welcome change.2) Price: is actually more approachable on the newest gen, especially if you purchased at Christmas time 2018 like I did.Annnnd.. that's about it in terms of ""better than the last gen"". I did notice that it connected more quickly to the WiFi, but that could also be that I'm more used to the app on my phone and the procedure to connect everything the way it was. So on to CONS.CONS: As Amazon I'm sure spent more on R&amp;D as well as more material necessary for this model, the bigger speaker as well as the adapter (what a beast) they probably were thinking some parts needed to be cut to balance the cost. This unit has only 4 mics (down from 16 on the gen 2) and while it's not too terrible, I CAN tell the difference. I find myself talking deeper or raising my projected volume in order for ""her"" to wake. Sometimes I see the Echo Dot frantically ""looking"" for the direction of my voice even after waking and getting my request all wrong because it probably wasn't ""focused"" at the best position to receive instructions. I DO think Amazon could of gotten away with 4 less internal mics, I'm also sure they tested things and got reasonable results and that's what I get ""reasonable"" not terrible, but not at the level they set the bar with either; which feels like a disappointment.2) It's bigger and heavier and uses more power. This should be expected in going through with a newer generation of the same product especially since most loyal to the product will be doing so for the speaker upgrade. So the only reason I bring this up is because my Echo is mounted from under the cabinet in our kitchen. A clever designer created a plastic mount for the Echo 2nd gen (which fits the 1st gen as well) probably with a CAD program and a makerbot and sells these. They are sold in black and also white (which is my Echo's color so it best matches the kitchen even it you manage to see it). When Amazon changed the physical dimensions, I was forced to purchase a new kit (from the same seller who now had an updated kit for gen 3 Dots). So all this to say: if you're upgrading and it's mounted, you will probably be forced to re-purchase something you thought you already took care of.3) Volume levels. Volume levels are different on this Echo. Typically if you want to change the volume on your Echo you have a manual button on the Echo (which I'm not a big user of). And there is the verbal command ""Alexa, volume 6"" (levels go from 1 to 10). On the gen 2 Echo Dot when doing this, the Dot would play a short tone at the level that corresponds with ""level 6"" -just a helpful feature that allows you to estimate where you need to be with what you're listening to. To my knowledge, Gen3 Echo Dot lost this feature. Surely you can still verbally raise or lower the volume, but there is no audio indicator for what ""level 6"" is out of the 1-10 volumes. I contacted Amazon about this and they ""took it as a suggestion for an option on the Alexa app"" So thank you, but it was Amazon's idea to add this in the first place -it's just as likely their idea to remove it -so, not holding my breath.4)Power brick. Again it was an inevitability with the bigger speaker. This is the most obvious change to the 3rd gen Dot that most reviewers are upset about. So was I, since it took a good bit of planning to make the 2nd gen dot as hidden as possible while not using some kind of battery to sustain it's power requirements. When I did the math I understood. I didn't like the change, but I do realize it was the cheapest way to satisfy the Dot's requirements to function as advertised. You see, 5V is the max voltage a Micro USB cable can safely carry. Even doubling the cables on one side like some older portable hard drive enclosures used to do to get the twice the power to the device wouldn't get the 12V necessary to run the gen 3 Echo Dot. So you go from a fairly ordinary looking USB A/C adapter/charger to a monsterous looking ...""wall brick?"" Which could prove a problem for some users depending on how small the space is in the area they are trying to power their Dot in.So all in all nothing is a deal-breaker for me( I play lots of music from my Dot), however the lesser feature-set confuses me. Amazon built itself on customer service and then later, the ability to purchase almost anything on their platform. They have become a force to look to when considering what sells since they are inventing and selling sometimes ""firsts"" in technologies. They have even established themselves as reputable technology vendors of products that are at or exceed the level of rival technologies at a reasonable price. So why set the bar and then under-exceed your previous product? As it's said, "" Getting to the top is easier than staying on top"" I don't believe that was the case this time around. I hope someone over there will read my review and take action to truly exceed the 2nd gen Dot in every way.",1
5,"Munch better than older model
  
",27.Feb.19,Yes,"I have the 2nd generation dot, and the eufy gene. The eufy at the time was much better than the 2nd gen dot, now the 3rd gen dot is way better than both.The first thing you will notice is the sound quality. There is way more volume paired with a quality sound as well.After using for almost a month now the 3rd gen listens so much better with background noise, and listens better in general. With the 2nd gen and eufy if I ask to turn my smart plug on I may have to command 2 or 3 times. The 3rd gen dot does it the 1st time 90% of the time.There are more features then the 2nd gen and the eufy.Amazon made a great step in the right direction with this. My only fault I see with this is the power supply. It does not use a USB connection and has a rather large head to go into the plug. This limits the costomazation of the product if you need a shorter or longer chord. What is in the box is pretty long, and I wish it was only a foot for the location.Over all this is a major step up and I highly recommend!",0
5,"serves my purposes very well
  
",27.Feb.19,Yes,"I bought three of these because the 3rd generation includes an intercom ability. Since then I have found it does a whole lot more. Other than the intercom ability, I use the Dots for instant information and music. The speakers are suitable for most music as I move around the house and pair easily to my blue tooth earphones for excellent sound quality.I'm sure I'll become addicted to it as time goes on. Unfortunately, my dog's name is Lexie, and when I say the command, ""Alexa,"" she looks up expectingly, then when the dot replies, she takes off.",0
5,"Alexa is my new best friend.
  
",27.Feb.19,Yes,"I bought this for my bedroom after receiving an Echo for Christmas. These were the last things I  thought I wanted until I received the gift. I am a senior. It is so easy to use. I use it for reminders, to give myself a morning routine, to acess my Amazon music, get the weather. I have even used it for daily reminders to alter behavior like ordering pizza. I listen to Native Ametican flute music to medidate. To listen to fireplace sounds on chilly days or nights. The dot has just slightly less sound quality than the Echo.",0
3,"Not Impressed. Very Horse and Buggie.
  
",28.Feb.19,Yes,"I am a new first time user. Before making my decision to buy I read several reviews and watched several YouTube videos to educate myself. After receiving it and using it, I think it is over rated. There was nothing easy about the set up of the Alexa app or the Echo Dot. The app took over 30 minutes to download and update. When i plugged the Echo Dot in, Alexa said go the the app and follow the directions. What directions? The app opened and all I saw was the outside temperature and the time. I expected to see a start up screen. I had to find the start up in the menu. The Alexa would not discover and connect to my Wifi even though my phone was connected. The app would just sit and spin and say no internet connection. I was sitting 3 feet away from my modem/router. After trying over and over again I finally had to set it up manually. The same thing with my new Vizio Smart TV. I had to call Vizio technical support and get help with that.  The only thing this does with my tv is to turn it on and off. It always comes up with the Amazon Prime and I could care less about that. Now if I want full tv function I have to buy a Firestick. The Alexa app does not recognize Netflix, or YouTube, and many other social media outlets. Very limited. I have a new HP laptop with blue tooth and Alexa or my laptop will not discover each other.  Trying to get the Alexa app on my laptop is just an endless circle with the app asking for my phone number to send it to my phone. I don't think the sound quality is all that great so I added a Vivitar Bluetooth speaker. Alexa did discover that and the sound quality is much better. I tried to plug in a set of Logitech speakers, that worked but Alexa then disconnected from the Bluetooth speaker.  Very limited in it's capabilities. I live in a 900 sq ft apartment. If I want to use Alexa I have to move the speaker from room to room or buy more speakers.Alexa is very Victorian and prudish in her limited answers and almost boring. She has no sense of humor and her jokes are rather juvenile and corny. The developers must be very boring people and limited in creativity. This is nothing but a glorified toy. Alexa grow up.  I am an adult and live in the real world. If you don't want to hear swear words or talk about sexuality then put on more filters. Get real. If we can't have open honest conversation with real answers about anything then what is the point?Most of the things this does I can do on my phone and more.  Setting timers, making lists, searching for trivia, printing documents, searching websites...The is a money pit. If I wanted to turn my apartment into a smart home then I would need a smart hub, smart switches, smart receptacles, smart light bulbs, more speakers, more Echo Dots, etc.  This all seams very expensive, limited, archaic and horse and buggy. But is has to start someplace.",1
3,"great sound but Very hard to enable all the skills except for the very basics.
  
",28.Feb.19,Yes,It has great sound quality for such a small device. Got it  on sale for $29. Would_e been pissed if I paid 50 for this.  It seems like it has a lot of skills.  But trying to get them all to work is another story. It is very complicated to set up the skills to get your TV to work with it or your Amazon fire stick to work properly with that. Anything but setting up the very basics is extremely difficult at least for me it is so I would assume for others it is to . Right now the only thing I can do with it is play music call and text my friends ask weather and turn on tv. If I ask to  launch Netflix or something like that forget it it always says I don_ know how to do that one time and then the very next time it_l do it and I had made no changes so what_ going on here. Please simplify your products Amazon. Just like the only music I can play from this device is Amazon music. I really wanted to buy your second generation echo deluxe is with the woofer I believe it was about 350 Dollars but when I discovered all I could do is play music from Amazon forget it why can_ I play music from my sources. I believe for this reason you were losing a great amount of sales.,0
3,"Helpful But...
  
",28.Feb.19,Yes,"I always wanted an Alexa to help me with waking up, playing music, and keeping me on schedule. And she does do that however, there aren't many things you can do without being a prime member. To listen to music you need either apple music or amazon music. I thought maybe it would allow me to link my music that I download from the iTunes store but I can only use the apple music (which I don't have). I'm not a prime member and I don't have any special subscription. I was just a bit disappointed with the lack of things you can do without paying for subscriptions that's all.",0
5,"Much Better Sound Than 2nd Gen
  
",1.Mar.19,Yes,"I use these dots around the house in smaller rooms (bathroom, kitchen, etc), and the larger Echos in the big common rooms.  And I have some off-brand devices in bedrooms that work just like these.  Obviously the sound is better on the $150 ones, but it's not 6 times better!  These can be had for $25 if you watch for sales and at that price point the sound is really great!  I do recommend that you read up on the various mounting options that are available.  For instance, in my master bathroom I bought a recessed wall mount (yes, I cut a 4.5"" round hole in the wall and installed a plastic box inside it, ran the cable down the wall and out the other side to a plug, and then put a grate over it so you see a speaker grate with lights dancing behind it on the wall).  In my other bathroom, I have a plug mount so it hangs down from the plug with an integrated look!  The kitchen one is glued to the underside of a cabinet so you can't see it.  It's a smart home system without a ton of work or expense.  And I'm just starting to dabble in smart switches and plugs.....",0
4,"Good, but need some improvements
  
",2.Mar.19,Yes,"I bought these because I wanted a few speakers to listen to music, audiobooks, etc. at home. My apartment isn_ terribly big, so three speakers are sufficient. And they work fine as long as you are working with an Alexa-compatible app (Amazon music, audible, etc.), but if you_e streaming from another app (for example, the app I use to download audiobooks from my library), it is confusing and frustrating. I can_ get it to play on all speakers at the same time. Sometimes it will let me change the speaker with relative ease as I move from room to room, but usually it_ a big production. There_ no reason for that-except that it _ncourages you to use amazon services. _And perhaps the most frustrating thing is that Alexa won_ answer troubleshooting questions about her. She tells you to go to the _elp section in the app.",0
4,"Nicer than the old ones
  
",2.Mar.19,Yes,first of all when I tried to order them they were out of stock and I'm back order however I did receive it in the time specified. I would also like to add is that the new 3rd Generation Echo Dot has a heavier bass sound to it but unlike the first and second generation the 3rd Generation has audio settings on the Alexa app which is outstanding. It is of course a bit larger than the old generation dots and it seems to pick up voice commands much easier over music that is playing from it because that was a problem that I had with the old generation dots. I would recommend that their Generations over the first or second easily and I did it using the trade-in program provided by Amazon.,0

",2.Mar.19,Yes,"The 3rd generation Echo Dot rivals the sound quality of significantly larger and many times more expensive speakers.A true breakthrough in audio streaming quality, it reduces the space needed to the equivalent of a single wall outlet.This enhancement virtually restricts the earlier generations of the Echo Dot and Spot to command only functions.To be clear, you can still stream music on the older generations; you just won't want to after hearing the 3rd Gen Echo.",0
3,"Awaiting more advancements
  
",2.Mar.19,Yes,"It's okay. Like a lot of technology manufactured by Amazon it has it's limitations. Always surprised that the limitations are things that other brands seemed to have accomplished, but Amazon is lagging behind on. Of course Amazon's response is always that they 'are working hard to bring those advancements.' For example, you can't change the voice, yet you can with a Google device and I can with a GPS I've had for oven 10 years. Amazon may want to consider working a tad bit harder.",0
4,"Looks nicer but not bowled over.
  
",2.Mar.19,Yes,"I love my Alexa devices. But I feel this one is less sensitive (just barely noticeable, but it is) to voice, and the sound  is not any great change. I think I may like the second generation better. This third generation looks better and feels less cheap, though it is a little bigger if you have wall mounts for old ones. I have decided not to replace my other 2nd generation models for now. Do go for it when there are good sales though.",0
2,"Doesn't work well.

When I use the Alexa phone app, it works almost instantly. The Echo dots have a delay.When I tell it to turn something off, it tells me that device doesn't support that. But it does, Alexa. I use you to turn it off every day.Going to buy a Google home. Hopefully that works better.",0
1,"Quality control issues, second replacement.
  
",4.Mar.19,Yes,This is the second Echo Dot that I will have to return for sound distortion. Our first lasted about two months before the sound all of a sudden was distorted and staticky. We never have the sound above 50% so I know it's not because of having it up too loud. I was disappointed that they replaced my first echo dot with a refurbished one. Now that one (which is less than two months old) is having the same issue. Not worth the price.,1

Not much new in terms of functionality, though I believe they did add bluetooth low energy capability to this version, maybe some improvements to the speaker also.I suppose it's worth the price if you're new to the smartspeaker market, but as an upgrade from an older version I'd say wait until it comes with a transporter... Not much to write home about otherwise.",0

",5.Mar.19,Yes,"After much debate, i finally broke down and invited Alexa into my home via 2 of these echo dots. i cannot believe how handy they are and i have become slightly dependent on them lol.

Its listening capabilities are so good that it can hear me in my normal speaking voice from across the room. i have had to be care full because it will start asking me what i said when addressing my daughter (Alyssa). i am now in the market for more of the line like the Ring and smart plugs, im hooked!",0

The speaker is a bit louder which is positive but it doesn_ work half the time. It_ dissapointing that Amazon would release such an unpolished product. I would wait until amazon releases another or just purchase the echo dot 2nd gen.UPDATE: After I moved my Bluetooth speaker away from the echo dot the Bluetooth grabbed strength. It might be an interference between signals not sure but the dot works... it sometimes requires an unplug here and there but that_ all electronics.",1
3,"Fun to have but seem to crap out eventually.
  
",5.Mar.19,Yes,To start off I received and amazon echo one of the first generations for free from my bank which caused a ripple effect of me buying one of the dots to have in another room. Slowly they just started getting slower and slower so I ordered two of these around Christmas time to replace my older ones and put the older ones where I wouldn't use them as much. Well one is still going pretty strong but the other one has a blown speaker. Yes they have been up pretty loud but not so much that it should've blown it. I guess I just have bad luck with these hopefully you'll have better luck with them than I.,0
5,"Great device! An actual updated device!
  
",5.Mar.19,Yes,Typically now a days it seems like tv's games phones etc always has some sort of quick redundent thing/upgrade without actually having any sort of update. As with the model prior to this one these devices are great. updated model definitely has a huge difference in sound loudness and qualityn which is great. One thing that i was hoping to see this time around was some sort of stand alone power and or battery having to stay plugged is a majordr's i mean come on the device alone stands out for future tech all together so not having that cordless compatibilty seems a bit odd to me but im hoping to see it next time around!,0

She's only struggled once to connect to the internet. The Alexa app could use some work since it's hard to find what you want and doesn't have everything available in the routines app. Like when I say ""Alexa, good morning"" I have her respond with traffic conditions to work and the weather for the day. But I can't add the reminder to take my medicine so I have to make that separate at the same time everyday which sucks since I don't say good morning Alexa at the same time every day. I also work at two different locations so I'm unable to get the traffic and weather for one of the two locations since there is no option for a second workplace address in the app and what days to set it at. She also could be more friendly to comments about mental health issues from users.",0

",7.Mar.19,Yes,"Thought this would be a great purchase but found that they are more useless than useful. We purchased the 3rd generation after returned two 2nd generations that did not work well at all. We constantly were unplugging and plugging back in when the Echo would tell us that they weren't able to connect, or how it couldn't understand us. We would ask to play music and it would begin, and say playing such and such music from spotify, then nothing. It would cancel itself... I returned the 2nd generation and purchased the 3rd. Got them all set up and doing really well for the first few months but now we are having the same exact problems. The echo will turn red and it will delete items on our shopping lists... it would respond or stop mid saying something. Also, it will turn on sometimes when nothing else is going on.",0
4,"Good for baby's room
  
",7.Mar.19,Yes,"Our daughter's room is very close to the rest of our home, so we like to play some white noise to cancel out any of the TV noise while she sleeps. After doing some research, we couldn't find a noise machine for kids that we liked at a reasonable cost, so we bought the Echo Dot. This thing is great - it plays white noise, lullaby sounds, whatever works for your kid. I can talk to my Echo in the living room and turn it off/on without having to go into my daughter's room, adjust volume on my phone, etc. The speaker on it isn't anything special but it serves its purpose.The only thing I don't like is how it sometimes cuts out in the middle of the night. I assume this has to do with a loss in Internet connection but I am not sure. A lot of noise machines work on timers, so having something that could play all night was big for us.What I like the most about using the Echo Dot as a noise machine is that, when my daughter gets older, I can still use it, instead of storing it away with the other baby stuff. For &gt;$50 bucks (goes on sale quite often), you can't go wrong.",0
5,"Works great
  
",7.Mar.19,Yes,"good voice recognition controls and adaptability, it's really intuitive. I don't have a handbook of commands but I did learn a dozen or so just from playing around now I know about 50 the real key comes in the syncing of different apps to give it more abilities calendar checking and basically working as your assistant. While some of the commands I think are a bit long winded like ""Alexa tell xbox to press a button"" or the find my phone feature that makes you spue out your phone number without any breaks as you would normally have. The verbile vomit can be a bit annoying but the power in it is worth the price.",0
5,"Work great as a stereo pair with an Echo Sub.
  
",7.Mar.19,Yes,I ordered two of these thanks to a SiriusXM promotion and set them up as a stereo pair with my Echo Sub. The sound this pair makes is better than the original Echo (beta testing version) I had set up before. The 3rd gen dot has much better sound quality for music than the 1st and 2nd generation dots also.They were very easy to setup using the Alexa app on iPhone. Something that might help you in the future; push and hold the action button until the ring turns orange to put an echo in setup mode.,0
5,"Worth the price of admission to upgrade
  
",7.Mar.19,Yes,"We own several of the 2nd Generation Echo Dots and love them. After plugging in this 3rd Gen, I can honestly say I love it even more! It has a much richer sound and seems to have a better ability of picking up my voice. My 2 year old son is even able to get her to respond to him, which doesn_ happen on the older generation devices we own. Definitely worth the price and would even consider upgrading the older devices so the whole house audio skill I have set up will sound even better than it currently does.",0
5,"Blows away the competition
  
",7.Mar.19,Yes,"I purchased two of these for my sons at Christmas.  We already had a Google Mini at home I received for free and they loved the concept.Let me just say that there is no comparison in the microphones, responsiveness, and most importantly, the speaker sound.  The microphones pick up from other levels of the house.  The sound is double that of the Mini.  The speed of the processors and response is about instant.  I love the product and I am looking into other amazon speakers to replace the Mini.",0
5,"Big improvement in sound from Generation Two
  
",7.Mar.19,Yes,"I have two gen 2 Dots, and use them frequently.  But never for music.  The sound quality was just too lousy for that (I'm spoiled - we have Sonos in our home).  This Gen 3 has much much better sound quality.  In a pinch, I do use it for music.  Looks nicer, too.I do wish Amazon would have an alternative voice.  Those who have hearing loss can usually hear lower tones more easily - we need a MALE Alexa voice, PLEASE!",0
5,"Echo Dot changed my life
  
",8.Mar.19,Yes,"I am the type to honestly purchase new electronics and end up selling them because of lack of use. Not with my Echo Dot. I purchased this alongside two Kasa plug in outlets that are compatible. My first smart home electronics. I set it up right away. I have been using echo dot (Alexa) for a few months and it has changed my life. From the simplest thing to turning on and off my light and water cooler and setting and disabling alarms for me, it has made the little things just so much easier and FAST. I don_ want to waste the time to turn on my PC to play music while I get ready in the morning so I will just tell it to play a certain artist and genre, and it_ does so quickly. I struggle with insomnia from time to time, so some nights I ask for it to play sleep music, and it has such a good selection when it plays it for me. I absolutely love this device as a 19 year old open to using electronics for different purposes, and I am excited to find out the other skills and uses the device has! Thank you for creating this!",0
5,"Thank you Alexa...
  
",8.Mar.19,Yes,"I bought this and a smart plug for a lamp that I could not reach. Alexa has been such a help turning the light on and off whenever asked. My granddaughter also loves this as well because she can request songs to put on a dance show for us. She also loves to check her math with it by asking for answers to confirm if she's right. It's always fun to thank Alexa after she does something for us because you never know her response, you're welcome, sure things, etc. Might have to get more of these for other rooms in the house.",0
1,"The Echo Dot support team scammed me out of $450.00
  
",8.Mar.19,Yes,"I called in for help when I couldn't get the set up done.  Was directed to a Mr. Mike Harvey who proceeded to tell me my system had a major virus. He said he could correct that issue. He needed to access my computer and Amazon Account. He said because I was such a good customer I won a $100 gift card.  He just needed me to complete the CC number to apply the card to. Instead he bought 3 - $50 cards and sent them to another email address.  He then accessed my email and AMAZON account - deleted all transaction notification and removed them from Deleted and Archive history. I asked him why he did that and he said they were just taking up space.  I told him to put them back, but did not. He was going to update my anti virus.  I got 3 $100 Google Play cards that he said would be reimbursed 75% after the program was installed. Well no program and not reimbursement.  And I still can't use my DOTS. I am very upset and discussed that AMAZON would have that sort of business going on.  I have contacted my bank to file a dispute claim.",0
5,"Improved version of the already brilliant 2nd gen. Echo Dot, excluding the mic.
  
",9.Mar.19,Yes,"Summary:The third generation of the Amazon Echo Dot smart speaker is better in many aspects from the already brilliant Echo Dot 2nd generation. Only one thing really bothered me about it, which is the built-in microphone, which appears to be inferior to the previous model.Since I already own the Amazon Echo Dot 2nd generation and the Google Home Mini, these are the comparison benchmarks that I can relate to in my review.The sound that comes out from the Echo Dot 3rd generation is pleasant to the human ears. It isn't meant to replace a true speaker if you plan to listen to quality audio, but it is adequate for background music in a small space (such as a room).As for how it's like compared to my benchmark smart speakers - The 3rd gen's sound is better compared to the Amazon Echo 2nd generation, and in certain aspects, it is better than the Google Home Mini.In my opinion, the Google Home Mini offers a more balanced sound and better ""mid"" range, while the Echo Dot 3rd generation has better bass and more impactful ""surround"" sound.The 3rd generation Echo Dot is louder than the 2nd generation and the Google Home Mini. While testing the Echo Dot 3rd generation, I've placed the device in one specific room, and the maximum volume level sounded too much for this space (3x4 meters). So though the audio quality sounds great, and there's not that much of a distortion, I prefer not to set the device to its maximum volume level.What I did is to set the 3rd gen to volume level 7, and it is about as equal as the Google Home Min at 100% volume level.If the Echo Dot 2nd generation looks like a hockey puck, then the 3rd generation looks like a stylish &amp; sophisticated donut.It's larger &amp; heavier compared to the previous model, but it's hard to go wrong which one is the newer model.Since the Echo Dot is Amazon's most affordable smart home speaker, it's good that Amazon offers it for about the same price.I purchased it during Black Friday/Cyber Monday 2018 when it was relatively new, for $23 (as part of a deal that included 3 units for $69). It's not always offered for this price, and Amazon should have the interest to keep the price low, but I still appreciate the fact that Amazon didn't raise the price of the intelligent device compared to the 2nd generation's price.For some reason, I never used the Bluetooth capabilities of my 2nd generation Echo Dot and Google Home Mini. In fact, I totally forgot they exist...That's why I was glad to ""re-discover"" this so obvious feature is available on the Echo Dot 3rd generation - And it works well with my other devices!Right from the start, I suspected that the newer model is less responsive. At first, I thought that the increased volume level prevents what I say to be heard. Every time I talk to the device, I test if it can hear my voice  sometimes I whisper, other times I talk while there_ music playing in the background, and I_ quite sure the built-in mic isn_ improved compared to the previous model.I think the main reason why Alexa misses some of the things I'm saying stems from the fact that the 2nd generation Echo Dot had a 7-microphone array, while the newer model has 4 microphones.The 3rd generation Echo Dot is powered using a power adapter. I don't mind the power adapter takes more space compared to the USB cable that energized the previous model, but I guess that as a result of the improvements in the audio/volume/size of the newer model, it consumes more power (15W compared to 9W), than the Echo Dot 2nd generationOverall, it seems that Amazon understands its customer_ needs and managed to improve the new Echo Dot so it would offer more features &amp; better quality for about the same price range.Please note I attached to this review screenshots + a video review I made about my experience with the Amazon Echo Dot 3rd generation.The pros:- Improved audio quality compared to the previous model.- Higher volume level compared to my benchmark device.- Stylish design.- Price remains attractive.- Bluetooth connection.The cons:- It is less responsive compared to the 2nd generation of the Amazon Echo Dot.- Bluetooth connection.- The device consumes more energy compared to the 2nd generation.****FAQ :****If you have any, please do ask and I will do my best to answer them.",12
3,"It's a nice start, may work well someday.
  
",9.Mar.19,Yes,"My real motivation to get the Dot was to create a connected music system. I have two of them, connected as a ""group"", each connected to Edifier 1200T powered speaker systems, which are in turn powered by Dot controlled outlets. The quality of sound now is far higher than the little bluetooth speakers, even though I have a couple of nice ones.The system Will consistently will turn on both outlets by automated ""routines"" or on command when calling for my ""upstairs group"", it won't though consistently execute my routine to play music on that group, but often only starts one set of speakers (we typically have well over 20 Mps internet). We don't typically walk around the house shouting commands at each other, so the voice interface is unnatural. I had hoped that the Alexa app might be useful for things like searching for music, but it doesn't have a search function besides again shouting commands it doesn't understand anyway.One of the most irritating things is that if it does start music, it may play 3 or 4 songs but then just stops. This is NOT an intelligent system, but rather a command line interface. It only understands exact pre-programmed instructions and figures nothing out based on AI. The voice command system is largely an exercise in futility as a search system, and Amazon's song selection and list creation isn't that great (and yes I'm a premium music subscriber). You can ask it to bring up your Pandora or Spotify lists, but adding longer strings of commands that way, then trying to get it to remember to play on both members of the group? No.If I do get the music group going, you can't ask it to change stations without losing one room or the other.  It frequently loses one room or the other, although the laggard will generally come back with the next song.So it is a nice gee wiz, and yes, I can sometimes get it to play the music I want in two rooms simultaneously. I like that my phone isn't tied up by a bluetooth connection, but frankly, my net result is generally better with bluetooth. I guess I should have sprung for a Sonos system, although that was going to be a lot more money.Bottom line, I'm  suffering from buyers remorse.  I have nice sound systems in two rooms. I can't say that I have a multi room setup.",0
5,"Way better than previous Dots!
  
",9.Mar.19,Yes,"The original and second gen Dot was a total bargain and pretty handy to have around in places you just wanted another alexa point. This 3rd gen Dot is however, fantastic - I use mine in the bathroom for when Im getting ready and want to hear the news or listen to music while I get ready and shower, etc. Before I could barely hear the speaker over the faucet running, hair dryer or shower noise - this new one is much louder but also better quality sound. It is a bit bigger which is not a concern for me.If I had a bigger place I would totally consider getting another for the bedroom at some point but between this in the bathroom and the echo plus in the livingroom I am pretty happy.For the price, you really cant lose. Enjoy !!",0
5,"She's impressive.
  
",9.Mar.19,Yes,"Alexa has changed my life, a little. But a good change. I bought the plugs and and a WiFi light bulb that changes color in an old antique globe lamp that was losing it's paint from wear now it can be red without paint chips, or green, or pink. I also bought the firesticks to enable to pause and playback on my television with Alexa. Okay I know it sounds a bit lazy, but when your hands are full like say eating while watching TV, it is great.  I can control most of my home with my voice. Maybe lazy, but I say efficient. You can also turn your lights on from anywhere else while on vacation to make the appearance that your home for security. There is also an app that plays iheart radio while I'm gone and keeps background noise for my dog. If I had to pick something to complain about, I wish you could pick your own wake word or she knew you were talking about her as opposed to her. Tiffany Hadish made her play Janet Jackson on Nobody's Fool, which was kinda funny the first time, but I could see it getting old hat. You'll also notice your eyes will glance across the room seeing if she lights up to unwantingly take part in your conversation, when you say her name casually like you accidently said the name of the person your gossiping about and they might be in earshot and heard you. But she's fun to have around the house. Timers are a lifesaver as well as even asking her the time.  Games like SongQuiz are awesome that's has all generations of my family playing along, family game night is back and you don't have to clean up thimbles and fake money when it's over. She even tells me when my packages are at the mail box so I know my mail came. I use the lists for many of things, things I need for different projects at my house or for a trip the grocery store. I love Alexa she's awesome! Also an interactive kids tv show with an animated Alexa might be cool.",0
5,"Great satellite for the Alexa system
  
",9.Mar.19,Yes,"I purchased Echo Dot to add to my existing Alexa-based smart home system. The integration was simple and easy. Because of the proximity of the main Alexa unit, I had to change the default wakeup name from Alexa to Echo. Using the Alexa app, that was not a problem. The smaller speaker doesn't quite have the same music fidelity as its larger sibling, but it's not bad. And it's nice to have an extension to the smart home commands. I plan to purchase additional Echo Dots to provide coverage throughout the house.",0
5,"2nd Gen VS 3rd Gen
  
",9.Mar.19,Yes,"3rd Gen: slightly larger but not so much as to create a space issue if you are replacing 1st or 2nd Gen.  Also, it has ""cloth"" which may not be as easy to wipe clean but I personally don't touch my unit much... so no accidental cheetoes finger prints left behind. The upgrade to this unit is most definitely in sound quality and volume. I recommend the 3rd generation.",1

",10.Mar.19,Yes,"El echo dot tiene una construcción y desempeño sobresalientes:  Pequeño, con buen sonido, el anillo de luz da retroalimentación útil y puede usarse un parlante alternativo por cable o bluetooth; el asistente (Alexa) en español es competente y no tan mecánico como el de GoogleHome. Si bien el uso en español es posible y útil, tiene limitaciones asociadas con restricciones asociadas a la tienda en que se compra (la de EEUU, México o España dan acceso a conjuntos diferentes de skills de Alexa; por ejemplo en la de EEUU no es posible habilitar algunos servicios de noticias que sí están disponibles en la de España) y a la pobre oferta de interfaces en español o para mercados fuera de EEUU  de algunas aplicaciones limitando su valor (por ejemplo, no he podido hacer la integración con Harmony Hub, pues al usar el Echo dot fuera de EEUU no se habilita el uso del skill).",27

",10.Mar.19,Yes,"""Of all my wi-fi devices this is the only one that would not reconnect automatically to the home wireless network after any type of disconnect. Every time you re-plug it at new home location, lose power or the like, the thing is at loss and wants you to go through a setup routine anew, smart?""Above was my original reaction. After weeks and multiple trials, frustrated, I posted a one star review, got call from Amazon on my voicemail next day with an offer to help, came home and plugged the thing in again (just to make sure it still did not work before I called back) - and it worked! Miracle, don't know what to think.  In disbelief I tried few times more.Went back into the setting, found a suggestion to allow Amazon to store a wi-fi password so new devices could be connected automatically. Was it a privacy issue then and my Echo did not save the key first time(s)? Then how had it been fixed w/o my intervention - a mystery. Don't understand what's wrong with saving wi-fi passwords in the device's some sort of non-volatile memory on a first setup, as apparently all my other devices like cameras/speakers/tv do. Unless the device is not secure maybe? Never thought of that, what about cameras? Anyway, problem solved, not an issue anymore.Thanks!",0

I will command Alexa to turn on a music channel and when she can_ seem to figure it out i just give up and have the google home mini play it instead.  The mini understands the same command that the dot does not.  I would bet that the echo dot can get louder than my google mini but i don_ know because the volume never needs to be loud. Especially living in a townhome with a shared wall.  the quality of the sound is poor at the  low level we use it on.  I feel like the bass needs to be turned down and the treble needs to be up at that low level because it_ not clear.  For that reason I struggle to understand it as well.

Unfortunately, it is not compatible with my surround sound system that is throughout the house.  I was hoping that the music could play through those speakers rather than it.",0
1,"Audio sounds like it's covered by a blanket
  
",11.Mar.19,Yes,"These devices have EQ settings, which was good to discover, but even with the treble maxed, the bass all the way down, and the mids set for best clarity, the audio is muffled. I have $10 radios that sound better. The music is so so. The voice sounds like it's talking through a pillow.We do enjoy these devices for some things - music at dinner, ""flash briefings"" in the morning, and occasional time and weather checks. It's rare to check traffic but it seems to work well.What prompted this review was something I read somewhere that said the audio was better if you ordered premium service. I don't know what that's about - I'm already paying for Prime, I guess now Prime has it's own audio version of Prime, for more money, and I can see where Amazon is going with this.The audio stinks. The device is nothing but a paper weight without audio, and they designed the audio to stink. And if you want improved audio, you have to pay extra? Seriously?",2
3,"An amendment to my earlier review.  Re.  Home Automation.
  
",11.Mar.19,Yes,"I alternate between being awestruck and total frustration.  It depends on hat you wish to do.I have to admit I find the technology to be very interesting.  The book I read on it led me to believe that I had to go through some sort of Voice Training exercise to get this to recognize and respond to my voice.  I found his not to be the case as both me and my wife no had difficulty in communicating with her.  She seems to have quite a range of things that she can answer and I often find myself thanking her and later realizing she probably doesn't care.Some very pleasant surprises like the fact that I can tell her a word and she can give me the proper spelling, very handy for one who cannot spell worth a hoot.  Weather reports, major events, time of day, setting alarms and timers are among the many useful things she can do.  Got a song you like or want to hear a joke she can do that.  She takes the moral high ground so don't ask for anything X Rated.  It is truly impressive what she can do!But there is a down side to this.  Many of these issues may have solutions however you will need to be much sharper than this old duck.My first concern is for security.  It is a well known fact that she will occasionally get initiated for no apparent reason.  Then there is the fact that I wanted to get local traffic information so I gave here my location and Cell Phone number.  I was taken back to find that she had ingested all my contact information without asking!  I am not sure where Alexa stores her scripts however I would not be surprised  to find it on the Cloud some place (for my money nothing there is secure!).But since it is such a neat deal we sorta glance the other way and overlook many of those issues.  My next great heartbreak is when we decide to utilize it as the Voice Interface for some home automation.  I have managed to get a few things to respond to my voice commands however this road is long and filled with many potholes.Our first pothole came when I was trying to install the Alexa Software.  Originally I had intended to install it on my iMac however I could not get the software to install.  I was able to get some assistance and the first thing the man told me was to install it on my iPad (I would be willing to bet there are some issues with the Mac version).  We began that process and immediately ran into problems.  I have to own up to not checking out the router settings as it will not install on anything other than the 2.4 g router setting.  Once we switched the router the installation went rather smoothly.We began our home automation adventure with the Starter Kit from Sengled.  It is a very good deal with a couple of lights and and Bridge.  However there were some installation  and compatibility issues.  A common thread with most of this Home Automation stuff is that it is not very intuitive and there are no help options in the software.  The bridge will allow you to add quite a few lights however they get pretty pricey (this is where they catch up).  Now if you think there is any compatibility among the different manufacturers you have another thing coming.Bought some other wifi enabled lights and found I needed to install another app!  At last count I have eight different apps running in my home automation group on my I pad.Wireless things that were already on line don't appear to be discoverable and this is also an issue.Now we have something that was intended to tie all this stuff together however this also seems to be a bit of a train wreck.  It is called IFTTT and it was suppose to allow all these different devices to work together.  I have been able to use a few of these widgets however I find myself powerless to deal with them.  The Alexa Software says that some of them are there however I have little control over when and how they execute!  You are suppose to be able to script them and have multiple widgets run from a simple voice command however it looks like this may require another app and that may only run on my phone.  There is little help available for IFTTT since it is suppose to be a no brainer (guess where that leaves me).It appears that the Hype far exceeds the reality.  This would make a fine hobby for some nerd however I find that fun just keeps coming.There could be a few more stars available but some one will need to show me of that intuitive stuff they have been hiding.An Update regarding home automation.  It should be worth noting If you want to use Alexa fore home automation.Saturday 27 July there was a wide spread internet outage that affected large parts of the Northwest.  At first I did not think much about it until I began asking Alexa to do things.  Her response was that there was a problem and I should go to the Help Menu in the Alexa app.  The did not work as did any of the items I wished to control through Alexa.If you loose your internet connection Alexa will cease to function.  She will direct you to the help menu in the Alexa App.  So if you suffer frequent outages this may not be the home automation app for you!",0

I know I can lower by voice command, but sometimes doing it manually is quicker to get it just right!Plus the _abric cover on the new DOT is harder to keep clean.

You can set each one with a different time alarm to remind or wake individuals according to their schedules....I'm surprised at how many practical uses these little things are capable of - and for their size the sound quality is great! Games, weather, sports, recipes, they can tell jokes that are actually funny!  ...way too many options and features to list here.  I LOVE THESE THINGS!!",0
1,"Is 'Alexa Guard' really coming?
  
",12.Mar.19,Yes,"Is 'Alexa Guard' really coming?  I would like to hear any and all reply comments.I have two 3rd Gen Echo Dots and a Ring Alarm system ... but Amazon will not provide a 'specific date' when it will be made available to paying longterm customers like me. All they for the last 4 months is 'coming soon'Here's what ADT is officially saying. IMHO ... I think Amazon has 'Guard Issues'In September, ADT announced it had expanded its relationship with Amazon by supporting the integration of the Alexa Guard feature with the ADT Pulse security system. The intent is Alexa Guard will turn the Echo and Dot voice assistants into audio sensors that can be integrated with the Pulse system. ADT_ professional installation and monitoring solutions are expected to be offered to customers through the Alexa Guard website and Amazon mobile app._e_e working with Amazon to refine the go-to-market strategy. They have been strong partners to us, but the full launch will be made when Amazon and ADT are ready, and we don_ yet have a date for that, DeVries said. _e have a very high bar.

3,"Good improvement in audio, but it comes at a price
  
",12.Mar.19,Yes,"I have three Echo Dots in use in my house, two of them on small ""outlet shelves"" that are built to hold small smart speakers.The Echo Dot v2 speakers work great with those shelves, as they can use a small USB power port to cut down on cable mess and not block one of the outlet plugs.The Echo Dot v3 is a little bit bigger, and while it just barely fits on the shelf, it does NOT use a USB power supply, and the included power supply is big enough to block one of the outlet ports and you can only do so much to compact a 6 foot power cable to fit in the 8 inch distance from the plug to the back of the speaker.Function-wise, the v3 is a great improvement. The sound is louder and has more range.Design-wise, you sacrifice the ""fits anywhere"" and USB-powerability of the v2.",1
5,"Little Dots Made Alexa Available House-Wide
  
",12.Mar.19,Yes,"I bought two of the 3rd gen Echo Dots when Amazon was having a special earlier in the year. I have an Amazon Echo but it was in the bedroom and I found myself wanting to hear music or ask questions from other rooms. Two dots have Alexa available to me all over the house, and now I hear my music in every room. My husband and I also use it as a whole-house telecom system via announcements or drop-in and this works great to get one another's attention without having to yell. I know there is much more I can do with this that I haven't had time to explore. The speakers are very good - better than anything I grew up with in the 1970s. The Echo Dot speaker sounds like something I would have spent several hundred dollars on back in the day, or a radio today (although maybe even a little better than some radios). I have nothing bad to say about the Echo Dot.",0
5,"I Love My Echo Dot!
  
",12.Mar.19,Yes,"I recently received an Echo Dot as a gift.  I knew of them but wasn't looking to own one but I didn't return it.  Eventually I set it up (which took me a while, I'm an old lady :-)  I started out asking Alexa simple questions; music, weather etc.  Then I synced it with my Sirius account to listen in my home.  Then I got the Alexa App and  started making lists;  shopping, To Do, books to read....I love this feature as it all goes to my phone.  I'm definitely enjoying this and who knows what I'll do with it next week!!",1
5,"Great AI device. 3.5 jack turns off alexa speaker
  
",13.Mar.19,Yes,"I got alexa so that the government can listen in on every conversation we have and be bored to death.I got three alexas for the purpose of intercoming between rooms. Our house phone has this feature but others felt it was easier to wake up the dead by yelling down staircases so now they find it fun to drop in the other rooms to call each other. Besides that feature alexa is very smart and has surprised us all. At times she does not understand 7 year old gibbirish and gives random answers, but that is expected.This little device is great. It would have been cool if the 3.5mm jack didn't turn off its external speaker. I tried to have it plugged into a stereo but it's not used often. But then we can't hear alexa unless the stereo is on. Another idea would be to allow settings for the jack. Another alexa sits on top of a bass speaker with input Jack's. If I could chose to only send bass frequencies I could then have a little bass to the external speaker.But overall we are happy and sorry for the boring conversations.",0
3,"Amazon 3rd Generation - Not As Touted in Release
  
",13.Mar.19,Yes,"In my opinion, I can hear no improvement in the sound quality of the device, and the device is less sensitive to the sound of my voice than the previous one I had where this one sits; and in general, I have a harder time trying to verbally communicate with this device.  I bought an additional device (total of three now) so I that I could have more units in spread around the rooms of my small apartment to interact with and so that I wouldn't have to talk loudly or repeat myself and go to the machine to speak to it in order to get it to work.  The short:  Now, I wish that I would have just looked into trading in the whole set of my purchases of Alexa devices for credit to my account and been done with the aggravation.  Also, cannot get setting ""Follow-Up"" mode to turn off/on in the Alexa App.I have always embraced new technology, and I really, really want to like this more than I do (particularly since I invested so much money!). It's just like having something else in your house electronic that you need to keep setting and re-setting and troubleshooting and diagnosing all of the time, which I already have to do for my computer and smartphone, and it never quite works the way you want it to.",0
5,"Love love love
  
",13.Mar.19,Yes,"I am so happy with this little thing! I bought it for myself while it was discounted over the holidays. According to the tracking notifications it went ""out for delivery"" but never showed up at my door (and is still stuck in that status all these months later...so I'm pretty sure that someone stole it). However, after waiting a long time I finally contacted Amazon about the missing order and they quickly re-ordered one for me which arrived safely and quickly at the end of January.I am using it in a small room so I didn't need a full size Echo and it has been easy to set up and perfect in every way. This is my very first Echo product, but years ago when it first came out I had purchased and gifted the 1st gen full size Echo which impressed both me and the recipient. I don't see any going back and I will start investing in compatible smart products.",0
3,"Sounds better listens worse
  
",13.Mar.19,Yes,"I was very excited for this new version but I find it more often than not frustrating.  I could give the version 2 commends walking past it, this one I have to stand in front of it and speak loud and slowly.I have three echo devices and I have to talk so loud to this one while I am downstairs where it is that the two upstairs hear me and respond more regularly that this one does.But it looks better and I got a deal on it at Christmas so I left it.I don't know if mine is defective or Amazon focused so much on the speakers that something got left out of the microphones.It does look much better though, but looks aren't everything.",0
4,"Slight improvement over the previous generation
  
",13.Mar.19,Yes,"The Echo dot when on discount are great value! The new model is heavier and seems built very well. The deep base is slightly better than the 2nd Gen dot, however still not as good as the full size Echo, however songs with bass will quickly make the speaker rattle which makes the speaker unusable at high levels. The tinny sound from the 2nd gen echo dot is gone and now has slightly more bass in this model.  I don't find the mic's work better which I was hoping they were.  The new model has a hard time recognizing my Wemo light switch for ""bedroom"" and often says ""Bedroom can not do this action"" while the older Echo dot 2nd gens had no problem.",0
3,"Good but much much less functional than expected.  Real problems with Australian amazon accounts.
  
",13.Mar.19,Yes,"I bought this product to explore the Alexa/Amazon universe for the first time.  I intended to use it with my two Amazon Fire TVs that I had just acquired.  The echo dot is *good-ish*, but there were a lot of problems, rather than everything working ""straight out of the box"".1.  Initially, all of the TV control functions would not work, and on investigation the entire menu section in the Alexa App for TV controls was missing.  It took weeks to figure out what was going on: Amazon had decided the device was being used in Australia, and although they don't tell you this at all, Amazon chooses not to let Australian users control their TV through Echo Dot.  I don't know why.  Although I bought the Echo Dot in USA, bought the TV in USA, downloaded the Alexa App from the USA iTunes store and am using it in the USA, I once used to live in Australia.  This was frustrating as all of the ""Help"" sites said ""navigate to the TV settings in your Alexa app"" and this whole section was missing.  I eventually solved this after several weeks, but it involved having to fundamentally change settings across my entire Amazon account.2.  After I solved this, I discovered that, unlike my trusty Google Home devices which can control multiple fire TVs, the Echo Dot can only be paired with one Amazon Fire TV. Really annoying, as this also limits me using the other TV as a speaker.3.  Since then, I have battled to get Alexa to actually control the TV it is paired with.  It can definitely turn it on and off, but after that... well if there's a solution, I haven't cracked it.  I've stopped using the Alexa and have gone back to using my Google Home as my primary ""media control"" device.4.  Echo Dot and Alexa refuse to acknowledge my Audible account. Well, no, that's not quite true.  They won't acknowledge my Audible.com.au account, which I log into using my Amazon.com username and password.  Australian Audible is not OK.  The only way I can listen to an audiobook using the Echo Dot is to start a new Audible.com (not Audible.com.au) account, and re-buy the books I want to listen to.  As you can imagine, I am underwhelmed.5.  I use Alexa/Echo Dot to control my wifi lights at home, and it generally works well... adding new lights was not difficult once I understood the process, and grouping them into rooms has worked well.6.  I use simple routines with the Echo Dot/Alexa such as good morning and good night, which play me morning news, tell me the weather and turn the lights on/off as needed.  Not bad, but REALLY limited as to what information I can have played in my morning feed compared to Google Home.7.  She doesn't love my Australian accent.  Sigh.  Nothing I can do about that. Oh well.So.... for me, the Echo Dot has not lived up to the hype.  The advertising implies it can do many things, but in actual practice, it turns out it's mostly just a voice-activated speaker, and Amazon has chosen to be really difficult about country codes.  I'm not a google fan per se, but in comparison, the Google environment works much much better.",0
5,"Alexa is the friend in the room
  
",13.Mar.19,Yes,"I bought one form for myself and then one for my 52 year old brother who resides in a nursing home due to various medical conditions.  Nursing homes are not considered extremely social environments and this makes  Lon's stay monotonous.  Having Alexa at his side allows him to actually have another voice in his room and connects him with various outlets that are otherwise not available in that kind of housing.  He listens to his favorite music at will, checks on the news etc.  I am very happy to help make his circumstances just a bit better and his life just a bit fuller.",0
3,"Alexa cannot substitute the Internet, but she is great for controlling devices
  
",13.Mar.19,Yes,"I think its great to use for controlling my devices, playing music, and even playing games. I also try to use it as a homework tool sometimes, but the Alexa cannot comprehend some questions. I assumed this would be similar to using a search engine online, but I guess not. Alexa has more limitations than I expected. My son likes to learn about sports, but if he asks something like ""what previous team did Kevin Durant play for"" she can't answer. We even tried rewording the question multiple times. My first time using Alexa (came free with Ring). Not sure how it compares to previous versions.",0
5,"Neat gizmo
  
",13.Mar.19,Yes,"The Echo Dot joins the Echo and the Echo Cube in my house.  I specifically bought it so when I am working in my office downstairs I can simply ""drop in "" on my wife upstairs without yelling to get her attention.  Yes, I also use it to get the news reports and to listen to my music on my XM account.I was surprised that it took nearly a week to receive it when I order other items from Amazon and they arrive within two days.Overall, I am pleased with it's performance and sound.",0
5,"Radio Replacement
  
",13.Mar.19,Yes,"I purchased this, my third Echo device to replace a radio in my office that was going out and sounded terrible. The new Echo Dot was a great alternative. Since I am an Amazon Prime Member, I have free access to Prime Music and with the Echo Dot, I am able to get access to a huge amount of Amazon Music and even radio stations by using Echo Skills. The sound quality is outstanding and it is easy to control and change music without having to get up out of my chair and go across the room. I would highly recommend the purchase of an Echo product for many needs and even as I did, as a replacement to a radio for music.",0
3,"Limited support
  
",13.Mar.19,Yes,"We purchased first one and then three more of the Echo Dot 3 units.  We enjoyed them at first but the novelty did wear off.  We use them primarily for intercoms and shopping lists, both of which works well.  My main gripe is that they are not programmed to tell you how to use them, what steps are needed to perform common tasks, i.e. how to interconnect with each other, what can you control.  Any question is that regards usually gets the same comment from Alexa, ""Hmmmm  I do know that.""  There is only so often you can can and wait in a cue for answers.  Alexa is a dumbed down Siri as far a facts are concerned.",0
1,"Disappointed!
  
",14.Mar.19,Yes,"Bought this in January and by March the speaker has started to mess up.  Sounds muffled and messed up.  Also,  there's a lag in response when I ask for the time. There's like a 5 second pause before echo answers. Also  unlike the previous generation this one stops playing music after some time. The older version would play music until I tell it to stop even if it meant all day. It looks better and the speaker is louder than the older version but it sucks! It's always having ""issues connecting with the internet"" almost every other day blinking red. I never had this problem with the prior generation. I regret upgrading now or maybe I just got a bad batch",1
2,"On its own, there isn't much Value-Add
  
",14.Mar.19,Yes,"I received an Echo Dot as a gift, and I had no idea what it even was. Or what it did.After plugging it in and linking it to my Amazon account, it appears to be another version of Siri. Without any ""smart"" light bulbs, security systems, thermostats, or other smart devices in my home, the only additional function I could see was to ask for the status of an Amazon order. I only order once a month or so, however, so that is not a big deal to me. I am already getting notified on the Amazon app and by email.I already use Siri on occasion and Google voice on my phone, so adding an Echo Dot did not enhance my ability to ask questions to an electronic device. And Siri answered more of my random questions accurately.In general, I don't like having to add ""apps"" in order to get questions answered by the device. It's not very smart until you go into the Alexa app and add a bunch of functions, which means searching for them, testing them, or researching online for Top 10's, etc. It's exhausting. Just answer all of my questions without making me do the setup, please.In my opinion, if you plan to have a smart house and connect a lot of other services and devices, then this would be a perfectly acceptable controller to access and change those devices. But if you just want something fun to sit on the table and play with, just say Hey Siri and move on.",0
5,"Wonderful product, and I'm still learning how to use it
  
",14.Mar.19,Yes,"I am learning new uses for my Echo Dot every day. I started using it (sorry, her) next to my bed to give me time, weather, and music. That stuff is ideal. She has replaced my clock. Then I found I could get my favorite radio station. Although when I asked for NPR she wanted a station location. When I gave her location, she found two stations with identical names and asked me which one. I gave her one of the duplicates and now I have it whenever I want it. I have no idea what she did with the other one. Then I asked her for stories and jokes. She's excellent at those! Although when I asked for a bedtime story she needs permission, somehow. I haven't figured out how yet. I don't know how to convince her I'm 71 and old enough for a bedtime story.My next attempt will be at asking her to order something from Amazon that I regularly order, like my favorite coffee.",0
4,"Alexa. She's a true lady
  
",14.Mar.19,Yes,"I bought this Echo 3rd generation Dot, and I've hit to say it's pretty cool. I can tell Alexa what to do and she does it. It's the perfect quasi-wife"" for hopelessly single guys who are a little old fashioned and really enjoys having a woman around the house. She's always there. To this point, While servicing my needs for 2+ months now, she's been primarily limited to playing individual songs, playlists and radio stations around the world on iHeart, TuneIn, Amazon Music (non-paid version) and Sirius XM. I enjoy listening to audio books from Audible and Amazon, and that's as easy as 1, 2, 3. There's lots of built-in games, latest. News, sports scores and more. You can even order pizza or an Uber through this little darlin. Well, sort of, you have to enable her ""skills,"" (then just tell the newest lady of the house what. To do or what you want her to do for you. I got a great deal before the 2018 holidays, but that's gone gone gone. Should've ordered 4.imstead.of 2, but hey I wasnt planning on marrying her, I was just taking her for a test drive. But, I truly fell in love. I'm gonna try this next, ""Alexa, sweetie, I love you, bring Papa a beer!!!!!!"" Will foow-up soonish on how that worked out.",0

",14.Mar.19,Yes,"I'm a premium youtube subscriber and this doesn't support it, I think because they have a competition with google.",3
5,"THAT'S what I was hoping for!
  
",14.Mar.19,Yes,"I can babble on and on about Alexa and what it can do, but this review is specifically for the person who has a generation 2 and is thinking of upgrading to the Gen 3.  It's ALL ABOUT THE SOUND.  I have Gen 2 devices, and they work wonderfully, but each of them is attached to some form (either by 1/8 inch plug or by bluetooth) to a Speaker because the built in speaker on the Gen 2?  Let's be honest, it's a bit disappointing when compared to the actual Alexa unit.  But this Gen 3 is DEAD on fabulous sound-wise.  It's the Echo size and the Alexa sound combined together.  The kids now have Gen 2's in their rooms.  The living room and my room have Gen 3 and no longer require external speaker support.  And the play music Everywhere running on multiple Gen 3 units?  Ooh, baby!  Rig up a few iView bulbs set to the ENT scene...and you got yourself a disco!",0
3,"Could be great but Amazon restricts it  for $
  
",14.Mar.19,Yes,"Great: for voice action questions, music, links in easily with speakers bluetooth. This works good if Amazon would allow devices to openly work will all other smart home devices would be Great but the have restrictions targeted at getting you to buy there other products such as Amazon Spot etc. Such as shame.Poor: if you have a smart home will not link with as doorbell chime or any other camera based device with sound.  Ultimately Amazon requires you to purchase their video capable device to hear which is a waste.  So in my case had to go purchase Google mini which link with video doorbell chimes as well as other camera devices with sound capabilities it on the other hand is not as user friendly on all voice actions with my smart home. Note if you down load Alexa on computer or phone same problem it will not give you access to cameras or sound directing you must purchase their other devices what a waste.",0
3,"Still learning
  
",14.Mar.19,Yes,"So i'm new to the whole alexa thing, and i consider myself pretty tech savvy. However, setting up things on the echo was a little confusing at first. I still need to earn the commands. I mainly got it so i can use it for my spotify playlists. It worked great the first night when i set it up, but the day after, I asked alexa to play my playlist and it kept giving me nursery rhymes from amazon music lol. It was quite frustrating. So i went into the settings and realized that somehow my main music was set as ""amazon music""-(which i dont even have)  instead of spotify.  Once i switched spotify to my main music, it worked again. So hopefully it doesn't happen again. I will write an updated review once I learn more :)",0
4,"this thing is great only one problem
  
",14.Mar.19,Yes,"I love my echo but if you live in a location with no or pour hard line internet like me and are force to use wireless hotspots as a main source of internet then you will need some extra set up. the echo does no do peer to peer connections like Wi-Fi hotspots so if you need to connect it to one you have to buy a 3rd party Wi-Fi router to feed off the hot spot or establish a mesh system in your house, but once you do that it works great and doesn't drop off.",0

1,"Speaker blew out after a couple months of minimal, non-max-volume use.
  
",15.Mar.19,Yes,"I loved having music I could control by voice, and played music through this Dot about 2 hours per week total, in 30-minute chunks, with volume between 3 and 6 (out of 10 max). Today I noticed a singer's ""S"" sounds were fuzzy and blown out on a familiar song; I tried other songs, and sure enough, the speaker was blown out. This seems unreasonable, as I never even played at the max volume, not for extended periods of time, etc.The item is beyond its return window. I would appreciate if Amazon contacted me about alternatives. I have two other Dots (same model) and am worried the same thing will happen.",1
5,"Very Nice Addition to Our Home
  
",15.Mar.19,Yes,"Bought these for the kids' rooms. Easy to open, a snap to set up. I like that I was able to rename the dots to the kid's names/rooms in the app. Instead of 'drop in on Echo dot 2', I can say 'drop in on xxx's room'. Kids love them. Broke down and got the Amazon Music Unlimited Family plan too so they can stream different music simultaneously. Also cool that, although Alexa is in several rooms and the experience is seamless, each device retains its own identity. So if I set a weekday alarm for 6:10am in one room, it only goes off in the one room, not on all devices. Anyway, we are all very, very happy with the purchase. Thinking to add just a couple more now.... :-)",0

",15.Mar.19,Yes,"I got this because of the clock.  Because I cut the cord, I no longer have a cable box in my living room, so I didn't have a clock.  I had a 3rd gen. Echo Dot on the end table next to where I sit, and when i saw that Amazon was now selling one with a clock built in, I ordered it.  It solved the problem.  I found a place for the other one.If you ask the new one for the temp, it will display it on the clock while giving you the weather report, and then go back to the clock.  If you ask it to start a timer, it shows the count-down instead of the time.  Very useful.",0

In addition, let me choose a response other than _K. As an example: _o Housemaid, and it responds with  Yes Master",0
5,"I love Alexa!
  
",16.Mar.19,Yes,"She has been awesome and the customer support has been great. The only downside is that they don't tell you that you have to pay for a program to correct network errors. I chose the 4 year plan for $150. When I was working with support trying to get Alexa installed I found out that my computer is secure but the network Alexa uses had a bunch of malicious and junk files that had to be removed before she would work. It was an unexpected expense but I got a good deal on Alexa.It's not Amazon's fault that, unfortunately, I have a HTC Desire 510 Android phone (I guess about 5 years old) and it's not compatible with Alexa. So I guess I'll be upgrading my phone in the future.I worked with support this morning to pair a little wireless Bluetooth speaker with Alexa. They walked me through it and it went great. I can now have it near Alexa and have ""stereo"" sound.I like to listen to classical music on my local PBS station. My Bose Wave radio has a lot of interference on that particular station for some reason. All I do now is say ""Alexa, play 88.7 FM"" and it comes in very clearly.All in all, I'm glad I got her!",0

",16.Mar.19,Yes,"After initial setup, which was more or less simple, the device kept insisting to have my phone number. WHile I get that that is how it could get some functionality for messages and calls, fact is I don't care about it and do not want it. There was no way to have this stopped. Because of that, I simply remove app from my phone and the so called ""smart"" device keeps sending notifications (or at least it says so) to my phone -which is not connected!"" Second and more disappointing matter: outside of very simple questions like the weather, traffic and few others, most of the the time the device/service does not know the answer. Then there is the annoying fact that this ""smart"" device only understands if you ask or better said, pronounce words of places, cities, things, etc in English. WHy would that matter? Because at home we have 4-5 languages going on and we know the real names of place, things, etc....This spills into events, facts, history, etc of several other countries where we often go and need to get info of. Sometimes we have no idea what the English would be....We are at a point of disconnecting it and throwing it (unless someone wants it free). I'm going to give it a few days chance when I see about connecting a few lights and other and see how that works (though I do know that to make it work remote, I'll need to connect to my phone, but I'm setting up a Line2 disposable number so if I want to be done with it, I simply delete the Line2 and number.While I'm sure it has good uses for many other people; it does not work at all for us and other people in similar situations (we have checked with amy of our friends in more or less same and they all say the same.All in all, quite disappointed.",0

Won_ play music that I_e already downloaded from iTunes without manually doing it on my phone itself after having to pair it via Bluetooth. Also cannot connect to more than one device at a time. If I want to play music with my phone but want to use dual speakers I would have to use an aux cord to connect the two speakers. For the price, this product is a definite no.UPDATE: downgraded from 2 stars to 1. Would give it zero if I had that option. It constantly disconnects from WiFi and doesn_ automatically reconnect afterwards. I_ forced to go through the whole set up from the beginning. Also some of the skills it offers are glitchy, offering paid-for upgrades that don_ work even after shelling out the extra money.I wished I had returned this product when I still had the chance. But I was optimistic that things would get better once I got used to it and all of its limitations. Sadly, it got considerably worse and now I_ stuck with a piece of junk.",0
1,"less than expected
  
",17.Mar.19,Yes,"I purchased the device because the product description advertised as blue tooth speaker. Well it does not work as a blue tooth speaker with my TV set, which it stated that it did. Works with one TV as expected but not my other set. Both are Samsung Smart Tvs. Very disappointing. Returned it. Beware that it does not work as described with all devices. Look before you leap.  Was very impressed with the sound quality . Very nice. No battery must have a power soucre another negative. Customer support is lacking for this device. They run you around in circles and a little reluctant to admit the unit might be defective and reluctant to refund. But they will. Most features work well.Well I purchased a different bluetooth speaker for half the price and it works great. First try and all paired and connected perfectly. The sound is great to. I would consider an echo Dot again for all the other features if they can get this problem squared away. It a shame that it can't be used a a regular bluebooth speaker. I hope some of their engineers are listening. I invited Amazon engineers to contact me to help resolve this issue.",1
5,"How did I live without this just three months ago?
  
",17.Mar.19,Yes,I love my Echo. I_ having surgery next month and I set two of these up to control smart outlets in the living room and bedroom so I can control lights without having to get up. I really like the ability to set alarms and timers. I use one when I_ baking and another one for getting up in the morning. I have a routine set where the alarm goes off and then it turns on a light. A bonus from the smart plugs that has nothing to do with the Echo is that I can turn on lights in the house from my phone while I_ driving home (although Echo can be used to set up a routine for those as well).One thing  I didn_ realize is that you have to be connected to the internet for any of them to work. The speech recognition engine is not hosted on the local machine. I live in a remote area where the internet goes down from time to time. It would be nice if Amazon would enable some basic features like alarms to run internally.I was impressed with the sound; my Echo pushes noticeably more base than my Oontz Angle. I do have some problems with Alexa selecting songs with similar names to what_ in my library from the cloud instead of from my library. I_e gotten a couple of jarring surprises.,0
2,"Static Speaker
  
",17.Mar.19,Yes,"I loved the speaker at first, but I have only owned it for less than a month, and the speaker has a lot of static noise. It is not constant, but comes and goes.  The sound quality to not great. I have an Oontz Angle 3 Solo that has much better sound quality than the echo. As far as the Alexa features I love it. I just wished the speaker had better quality.",2
3,"Not as good as the older ones.
  
",17.Mar.19,Yes,"Doesn_ hear as well as second gen.  I wish I had sent these back in time for a refund.  I_e had them for a few months and they seem to perform ok when they can hear and understand me.  The 1st and second gen dots that I have seem to do a better job.  Also these new ones have a proprietary ac adapter so if yours gets damaged you can_ just use an extra usb laying around.The speaker is better, but that doesn_ really matter much to me because I have my second gen in a speaker dock anyway.  Probably going to sell these for a loss or try nd trade them for second generation ones.",0
2,"One step forward 3 giant steps back
  
",17.Mar.19,Yes,"The music quality of the echo dot 3rd generation is a huge improvement over the 2nd generation, but the redesign is buggy and consistently crashes. (We use ours a lot for timers and on occasion a timer will got off and not stop even after repeat commands until the plug is pulled) worse the reason why we chose to upgrade our devices was the lackluster ability for it to hear us. Our hope was this new generation would be an improvement but was a significant disappointment as it regularly does not hear or understand us.Updated 6.22.19- roughly a week after our review went live Amazon called to address the issue. After a reboot and reset I can say our echo dot still does not work correctly",0
5,"HELLO, ALEXA!
  
",17.Mar.19,Yes,"I was ready to send the darn things back, I followed directions, but couldn't get the little suckers to work.  I wasn't told, that apparently, the dots have a pecking order, #1 and #2. Who knew? I had left #1 dormant while I wasted time on #2. I gave one more try and started with the dormant one, and BINGO! Both of my dots hooked themselves up!  Wonderful! The sound is great and Alexa and I are BFFs. She finds just the right music and helps me in the kitchen. I'm going to buy 2 more dots.",0
3,"Mixed Bag
  
",17.Mar.19,Yes,"Seems to have somewhat better wifi sensitivity than the second-generation Dot, but that's where the superiority ends. Sound is bass heavy and muffled. It's also quite directional and speech can become downright unintelligible if the Dot is not properly oriented or close to your ear.I also found that the switch from a USB power supply to a dedicated one is not a convenience, especially if you have earlier Dots around the house, or need to relocate this one occasionally.",0
5,"Works great! Sounds fantastic for such a compact device!
  
",17.Mar.19,Yes,I_e been an Apple Device user for the past several years. So I purchased this thing and WOW!I_ super impressed by the technology!Alexa is far more fluent in Human interaction than Apple_ Siri!Plus having all of the Star Trek Easter eggs built into the system has practically turned my man cave into a Starship computer system! LolI purchased two of them and an Echo Sub and now have an AMAZING theatrical sound system and a very low cost!,0
4,"Great buy. Two for $50.00 deal.
  
",17.Mar.19,Yes,"As I did research on my kids request for an alarm clock in the morning I found the Echo Dot.  When comparing prices of alarm clocks, the ECHO this was a no brainer. My boys are able to play the music that they like and white noise at night for bed. They set their alarm and find out the weather for the next day so they know how to dress For school. Overall I am pleased other than it has to stay on the charger continuously. The only thing that would give this product five stars for me is that it_ portable. I guess I_ gonna have to upgrade LOL",0
5,"I know Echo Dot does all kinds of things, but I mostly use it for rain sounds
  
",18.Mar.19,Yes,"Echo dot with Alexa does all kinds of cool things. I know. I get the emails every week telling me all the new things up with Alexa!  I may get around to trying those things out one day...but mostly I use the Echo dot to play rain sounds while I sleep. It does that awesomely! I have seen my husband use the Echo dot to control our firestick. That was pretty cool. Alexa has answered my little ones questions with some quippy remarks a few times; that was fun. The dot has been pretty helpful in telling me the weather outside before I step out in the cold in my underwear--that's been a lifesaver. I think my next purchase is going to be the Echo dot thing that comes with a screen and reads you recipes. I probably won't know how to use that to its fullest capabilities either, but Amazon is still going to get my money because someone in my household will know what they're doing. 10 out of 10 would buy this again...actually, I did...I just bought the kid version...so, yeah, Amazon strikes again. I'm told its worth it. Get you one!",1
5,"works great nice sound quality
  
",18.Mar.19,Yes,Purchased Echo Dot to use at work in my office.  Wanted primarily for music but also to be like an assistant with questions answered easily.  For the most part it works perfectly.  Sound quality is good and no longer have to hassle with radio station static.  One complaint is if I don't ask a question every 3 hours or so it goes off.  When I ask why the response is was shut off due to inactivity in several hours.  I was listening to the music!  Oh well I adapted.  Another complaint is since live streaming music it goes off if get interrupted WIFI (which happens for me at least once if not more times per day).  Again I adapted.So yes I do recommend the Echo Dot.,0
2,"Functionally Disappointing, Get Google Home
  
",18.Mar.19,Yes,"My roommate got a Google Home since his family got 2 (or something like that) and a week later my echo arrived. Alexa knew more random facts and was able to keep things up faster than Google and honestly she was more entertaining, but functionally she was disappointing. The emails should you need for each and every little action gets tiring. Want to download a song on your streaming service, download the skill. Want to connect to other smart devices or equipment, download a skill. And the worst part is, the skills are buggy as all get out. The save songs skill worked for a day and then Alexa would say, ""you need to download a skill for that"". I tried connecting her to my 4 Phillips Hue lights and she created 8 lights and then wouldn't turn them off if called by their nickname. She was unable to turn off my Samsung TV for a while until I changed it's name to ""TV"". She can't turn off my Vizio or do anything with my Fire Stick. Unfortunately the list goes on. It doesn't have as loud a speaker system as Google Home either so I don't know why I even got it. I thought the voice assistant would be useful but Google is way ahead in that department too. I decided to stick it out for over a month and now unfortunately I can't return it, so don't make the same mistake I did.",0
2,"Apple Music?
  
",18.Mar.19,Yes,"Can_ get Apple Music to play and when I ask Alexa, she says I need an update to my software. When I try to update - nothing.",4
4,"Alexa, do you hear me now!
  
",18.Mar.19,Yes,"I like the Alexa. I wish there was a way to program my morning and night announcements in one segment instead of multiple segments. It gives only so many characters to write your message. I had to keep adding actions to my morning and night announcements. That was tiresome. It does not connect to a mobile phone. Maybe, I am not doing something right, but I did not see an option to connect my phone to Echo. There are a couple more things that I wish could be change, but overall I am ok with it.",0
4,"I Like It
  
",18.Mar.19,Yes,"Love hate relationship with this thing. I like everything it does, but, I don't like that it's always listening.  Nice that I can stop it from listening if I choose.The speaker on the dot is ok; at max volume, it does not seem loud when compared to the 2nd Gen Echo we also have. Speaker quality is also a step down vs the Echo.If you can splurge I would recommend the Echo vs Dot especially if you plan on using it to blast some tunes with it.",0
1,"Waste of Money
  
",19.Mar.19,Yes,"This really a waste of money. I can occasionally get it to turn on lights and start a timer. The frustration of trying to get it to do anything else is not worth it. The app is so confusing to try to get it to automate anything. Yes I can ask it some stupid questions or play a few games, but I can do all those things with my phone, and much better.Considering Google's assistant is already built into my phone and works better. It was rather dumb of me to buy this. It just seams like for all the things it does well, there are cheaper and better options.I just cannot stress enough how bad this device is. All the issues I seem to have, most people have to, by reading the app reviews.Update: July 4thI continue to believe Alexa is worthless for most people. Here is my latest frustration. I asked for the hours of a particular store. It got the right one the first time. When Alexa asked if I wanted to call, I said Yeah. It does not understand that Yeah as a yes. So I asked Alexa again. However, it started giving me Kentucky and other cities far from my location. I went and looked at what it thought I was saying. The first time, it thought I said ""New Bird"" every other time it understood I was saying ""Newberg"", but used the ""Newburgh"" spelling.So now I say "" New Bird"" for ""Newberg"", it recognizes it as ""New Bird"", but will give me ""Newberg"" info. This is what drives me crazy about Alexa, always having to figure out the magic words to get her to do what you want. Other times you give the exact same command and it understands what one wants, other times it will have no clue.",3
1,"Terrible sound with 3rd Gen Echo Dot
  
",19.Mar.19,Yes,"I already had two 2nd gen Echo Dots and was happy with them. Nevertheless I eagerly bought two more 3rd Gen Echo Dots when I heard that Amazon had improved the sound. What a huge disappointment. The Alexa functionality is the same (which is great) but the sound is absolutely terrible. At times Alexa's response is unintelligible, even after repeated attempts. The voice is very muffled as if it is covered by a thick blanket, and this is even after trying to tweak the base/treble using the app. I equate Amazon's attempt to improve the 2nd gen Echo Dot to New Coke (which failed terribly)! Trust me, given the choice, get the 2nd gen Echo Dot, or wait until a 4th gen comes out and keep your fingers crossed. The 2 new Echo Dots I bought will be stored away in a box as last resort spares in case my 2nd gens ever fail.",3
5,"Love the echos
  
",19.Mar.19,Yes,"Have three of the Echo Installed and absolutely love them.  Easy to set up and enjoy.So many uses, I use for my outside lighting and inside lighting. Its a clock, weather report. so many endless things you can ask. Love the shopping list and to do list. I have app on phone and when you go to the grocery store its right there, all the things you tell Alexa to add to your list. Plays my playlists and It works my TIvo box, changes channels and controls the recorded shows. There is so many uses as listed in description. I didn't realize how useful the Echo would be until I got them and started using Alexa controls.",1
5,"Exactly what I wanted!
  
",19.Mar.19,Yes,"When my ""Alexa"" version 1 lost her life, and was dead, I needed a smart speaker by my bed as I fall to sleep every night listening to the radio.  It is the reason I started out on this adventure of using ""robot"" like objects to ease the pain of being OLD!  Ha haha.  Safe to say, the Dot was just right as I do not have complicated needs, just radio, alarm, turn the radio off, and ""what time is it?""I have another smart speaker in my kitchen for listening to the radio, making grocery lists, turning on and off my kitchen light, and hall light.  You see.... pretty easy.  I love the help!",1
5,"Major improvement from previous Gen!!
  
",19.Mar.19,Yes,"What I like about this particular item is that it sounds much more better than the 2nd gen. The mini size woofer gives it the umph to hear such a better clarity and sound quality for the prize. Not to mention that it can be connected via Bluetooth and any device. But if you simply have an amazon account, it makes it easy just to stream music from your accounts with out the need to play from your phone. Just simply enable the skill for any music app and ask away. The best is that it now lets you even enable a skill to play your iTunes music if you are subscribed. This makes a perfect gift and an Awesome product overall!!",1
4,"_t_ always listening for the wake word
  
",19.Mar.19,Yes,"Appearance-wise, it_ beautiful. The power cord is not the same as the 2nd gen so if in case the cable is lost or needs replacement, if there_ still warranty that_ good, if not then that_ another purchase. The setup is easy enough. I find that the green ring is always running waiting for the wake word to be spoken so it_ always listening. I haven_ been able to load the history to delete recordings so I_ giving it a 4-star",0
2,"Lack of support w/ Echo team. &amp; Pore English
  
",20.Mar.19,Yes,"Technical support is basically nonexistent, I_e called more than a dozen times every single time they put me on hold and or the call dropped for no reason, I have called and tried to find out if there are records that I_e called and yes, no answer why the long waits . I tried complaining to supervisor, again I never get through. My questions are easy and simple. I needed to hear previous sound tracks  using the Amazon streaming service using the command, and never went through. I called more than six times regarding the same issue. Not a single individual figured out how to fix this?. Again there_ been other simple commands that I can_ issues with the device I witch is not executing.  Technical support is basically nonexistent, I_e called more than a dozen times every time I tried calling I_e ask for a supervisor, again I never get through. My question is still the same, I needed to hear  Previous Music using Amazon streaming .. and my commands  were not going through.  Still the lack of support that you get from the echo department is disgusting. I finally had to call the sales and returns Development to file a complaint.If anyone  is having the same call center issues I encourage you to write about it.",1
4,"Better than 2nd gen, still not perfect
  
",20.Mar.19,Yes,"If you like Alexa, you already know her capabilities, so I won't comment on that.  This Echo dot is much better than the 2nd generation speaker.  The sound quality and volume level of this is FAR superior to the 2nd generation.  The look is a bit more pleasant as well, as they fit more into a living room decor than the plasticy looking prior generation.  The microphone pickup ability on these is also better than the 2nd generation, but still not perfect.  I definitely still find myself yelling at Alexa to stop, or repeating commands at the top of my lungs because she can't hear over the TV or something.  Definitely worth the extra money to buy this one over the 2nd generation.  If they'd somehow manage to perfect what Alexa can hear over other noise I'd be 100% happy and give 5 stars.  Maybe I'm expecting too much?  Still, a very good quality appliance and I have bought several for other people so they can experience the benefits of Alexa.  It's much better listening to music and audiobooks on this model than the 2nd generation also.",0
5,"The speaker in this generation is a substantial upgrade! The only Alexa device needed!
  
",20.Mar.19,Yes,"I really like this little big upgrade from the previous dot. The speaker is much louder and for this I am grateful. I like how this can read me my kindle books. I find it 100% more useful than the google device that doesn't even have bluetooth and the speaker is so poor I haven't even plugged it back in. (I got it free with my nest thermostat I couldn't find a use for it compared to Alexa.)So I guess for me my take away from this is that Alexa is the only smart home device cordinator I need. Plus my kids can use it to make VoIP calls. Also free time was fun to play Disney music.I also use it to turn on and off light switches, set timers, alarms and tell me the weather.",0
5,"So many uses and improving all the time.
  
",20.Mar.19,Yes,"We have an echo plus with built-in hub in the living room and added the dot 3rd gen in our bedroom. The sound from the dot is surprisingly acceptable when playing music which was important as we often go to sleep to some of our playlists. Also, having access to all of our attached devices is convenient if I want to turn a light on in another room when waking up in the dark. I might get another one for our cellar. I recommended these to a friend who just built a new house and likes to listen to music in different rooms. He bought two and loves them. They also entertain their grandchildren with the games that are available.",0
4,"Easy to set up
  
",20.Mar.19,Yes,"I found it easy to set up. But, only after I sat down with my cell phone and did some reading. I now have 3 dots. I've replaced my radio in the bathroom with one. I have another in the living room. The third in the bedroom now has replaced my clock radio. I have alarms set with ""Reville"", ""The National Anthem"" and the ""Marine Corps Hymn"". That's enough to wake me and get me going. Sadly, I can't find one sound, a US Navy's ship with ""This is a drill, this is a drill. General Quarters, General Quarters. (Then the klaxon alarm)"" Experience from nearly 50 years ago would really wake me up. I ask for any type of music genre at night and it is restful. My only problem would be if I don't ask the question or command in the proper manner, it will come back with ""I don't understand"" or ""I can't do that"" or ""Sorry, I'm not sure about that"" or something like that.  For instance, I just asked what time an English soccer game plays on Saturday. Alexa couldn't respond with an answer. I then asked the question a different way and I got the game location, game time and opponent. It can be frustrating, but maybe it's me.",0
4,"So far, having fun, sound a touch muffled, Android app is battery drainer
  
",21.Mar.19,Yes,"Finding new things to do with it each day - Alarms and multiple Timers at once, Reminders like ""Alexa, set reminder for lunch at noon on Sunday"", 'she' repeats it back and at noon on Sunday, 'she' tells you, Audible books (subscription) which pick up where you left off, Shopping list (shows up on Alexa app on phone),  White noise machine at night (lots of free Rain, Thunderstorms, Crackling fire, Ocean Waves, Wind, etc), Games (song trivia, regular trivia, Word of the Day, etc), Flash briefings (easier to set up on laptop than on phone app) which give you are run down of quick news, or weather, or pop culture stuff - what ever you add to your Flash Briefing list, Entertainment (Music (lots free w/ Prime), Radio Mystery Theater,  Choose your own Adventure books (interactive), look for new stuff each day.The voice is bass heavy making it sound a bit muffled but that can be adjusted. You can also tell it to turn up or turn down - these commands are 10 level (out of I think 100) jumps, but buttons on device have smaller adjustments if just want to move a little (louder or softer) at least I think they do.The Alexa app on Android phone (Galaxy 5 - older phone) doesn't seem fully functional and I ended up removed b/c it kept 'turning on' in background and draining my battery! BUT when it was on there, it was neat having my shopping list right there. I'd say Alexa (or you can use the name Echo, Computer, or Amazon - if you have more than one device, trust me - name them differently) ""Add 2 dozen eggs to my shopping list"", 'she' (the device voice), says ""2 dozen eggs added to your shopping list"". Sure enough, open app, and touch ""shopping list"" there it is. I was also able to dictate a phone number to it and 'she' called it (was a land line) - sounds on my end was good, but the person I was talking to, said it sounded slightly echo-ish.",0
5,"ECHO DOT 3 IS AMAZING!!!
  
",21.Mar.19,Yes,"I really like the echo dot 3. You can use it in smaller rooms without a separate speaker or you can add a bluetooth or audio cable directly to a speaker.The sound quality out of it's own speaker is not jaw dropping. Truthfully, the sound is ok. At low volume or high volumes it gives acceptable audio. When connected to an external speaker then the quality sounds as good as your speaker can sound (or as bad).The look is much better than the previous echo dot 2 and comes in 3 different colors.I use money to control several smart devices ( light bulbs, humidifier/aromatherapy, smart plugs, Nest thermostat,etc). All of these work flawlessly with the echo dot 3. Non of my devices require a hub, so for the $49 you get a lot. It can answer many question, although not as many as the google home mini. You can play games on it like Jeopardy. It can tell you jokes, play music of course and much more. All you need do is add the equipment (bulbs, thermostat, etc) and allow the skill in the Amazon Echo App.I use mine every single day without fail. In fact I now have 1 in nearly every room in my house.You can also control any of the other echos that you have from any other echo. You can also play the same song on all echoes if you choose. So if you are are walking in and out of other rooms you can continue to hear the same song. The only thing that could make this better is a little bit richer sound from the internal speaker (which, again isn't bad). However, to do that, I am certain that a price increase would be involved.  I think $49 is a fantastic price and not to hard to swallow if you want to get multiple units like I have.",0
3,"Good, with some annoying features
  
",21.Mar.19,Yes,"I have a second-generation Dot, and just received this third-generation Dot today. In my very brief experience, here are my impressions.Definitely better sound quality, with noticeable (but not substantial) bass.The cloth exterior looks nice. Glad I ordered the dark gray - I'm not sure how long the light-colored one would stay clean, and it looks like it would be hard to clean it.The power supply uses a brick with a proprietary connector. You can't power this thing with a micro-USB cable anymore, like you could with a second-gen unit. I don't like that. If you lose the brick, you're in for a significant expense.I was in an online meeting for work when the Dot suddenly announced, in a loud voice, that it had received an important update and needed to restart. I had to apologize for the interruption to the other people in the meeting. I REALLY didn't like that.",0
4,"Not too bad
  
",21.Mar.19,Yes,"This is a piece of crap! 80% of the time it can not find the music I am asking it to play. I just spent 20 frequent minutes of my morning asking it to play yoga and meditation music while it was trying to drive me out of my mind playing some horrific frequency music. I would break it if I didn_ have to earn my money so hard. This device is a waste of money and time! If this is the glorious artificial intelligence, we are all in for a huge trouble and mess.UPDATE: I upstared my review because the problem was not with Alexa but with Spotify where it either played the wrong music or simply stopped playing in the middle of the playlist. I cancelled Spotify and switched to Amazon music. So far so good. Alexa still can not understand me so I have to control music through the app on the phone, but at least it plays without interruptions.",0
3,"Meh
  
",22.Mar.19,Yes,"I figured I would try a dot since my phone is listing to me all the time anyway.  I cannot say I am very impressed.  The dot has already stopped doing things like _his day in history and does not have access to many answers.I tried to use it with Rosetta Stone and that didn_ go over very well.  On top of this my smart light bulbs with with google home not Alexa (bummer).After owning this for several month now I use this as a glorified timer.  The interface is just not reliable or precise.  Also, on many occasions it turns on and listens which no activation word said.The tech will be great someday but at the moment it is spotty.",0
1,"Very aggravating
  
",23.Mar.19,Yes,"Alexa, big or small, is nearly useless. She has massive problems finding any useful information. She plays trivia games well, orders things off amazon, and the speakers sound good, thats about the end of what it does well. All of those wonderful apps that make it useful...music, podcast, controlling other devices, etc, etc....all of that costs more money. $2 a month here, $5 a month there, $9 a month for this, $12 a month for that. You want this thing to be useful...it'll end up costing you about a $100 a month.Update:Wow ... beware ""Big Brother"". If you give Amazon a bad review, they will call you and call you. They will harass you and pressure you into changing your review. They won't actually do anything about the reasons you gave them a bad review, but they will flex their corporate muscle and remind you how big they are.",2
5,"like
  
",23.Mar.19,Yes,"well hmm i said i would never have one of these or any other like listening device in our house and yet here i am reviewing one we got!! i wouldn't of ordered one myself before, this one came as a free add-on with the ring alarm system kit we bought on here and i honestly had no plan on using the echo 3 and was going to give it away but, curiosity got the best of me and well it only took a day to get hooked on this awesome no-hands device after trying it out. not having to stop doing what i am doing to go turn on music and skip songs or not having to remember to later write something down to buy on a list and just ask alexa to order it has been great since i forget to write things on a list later on 75% of the time. I haven't played around with everything this does, not really into all that game play/etc with alexa stuff. The music, shopping list/cart and phone messaging is all i care about really (am looking at them plugs to turn thing on &amp; off with alexa too now) and there are some issues like everytime i say order/buy something, it gets added to cart and am told to go there instead of alexa ordering/checking out even though one click and all is turned on.. also we first set this up on my ipad and needed a phone number to set up a part in app, being new to this, we didn't realize it would become that ipad's phone number for messages/etc.. and installing app on phone afterwards resulted in us not being able to set up communication on it because cell phone number was already being used by ipad -anyhow sure others already described everything about this echo 3. i like it, music sounds great to me on it (although not older music) and i can unplug it anytime i want and it easily reconnects by itself within a minute when i plug it back in. i don't bother with that part anymore since i keep it in kitchen corner but, it is nice to know i can unplug it and not have to redo setup when i decide to get more echo's for other areas of our house.i will say i was suprise at how far/well this echo 3 can hear us, i told alexa to shut off when i was in opposite side of house in living room to see if alexa/echo could hear us there and yup she heard me.. will admit at first that bothered me but, now not so much.",0
5,"Small Dot, Big Sound
  
",23.Mar.19,Yes,"I wrote 3 of the first 1,000 skills for the Amazon Echo when it first came out as part of a developer program. I received a first generation Echo, which has been absolutely fantastic. I wrote a few more skills and got a few more first generation Echo Dots. They were OK for listening to news, etc., but music on them was very tin-sounding.Fast forward to a couple of weeks ago and my wife saw the third-generation Echo Dot at an Amazon pop-up store at the mall. They had a promotion where if you bought two, you got $20 off, so she texted to ask me what color I wanted. I put it on my desk at home and I'm blown away by its sound quality. I'd say the sound quality of it is close to or at par versus the 1st generation Echo.It's a fantastic addition to smaller rooms if you want to listen to the radio, listen to music, or control your home. I'm absolutely delighted with the third-generation Dot. After hearing the sound quality of this device, I'm tempted to get a new Echo, as I'm confident Amazon's made great advancements in sound quality there, too.",0
1,"DO NOT BUY IF YOU HAVE TEENS!!
  
",23.Mar.19,Yes,"This product is ridiculous.  It's all over the web how parents bought this for their teenagers only to find out they can't use them.  Amazon does not allow teen accounts/profiles to access these devices.  That means you would have to use your account to register them giving them full access to buying because the echo thinks it's yours.  It also means no music custumization.  For as advanced as a company as Amazon is, this is a MAJOR shortcoming that needs to be resolved.  It should not be difficult to allow teen accounts to have their own echo with the same limitations as the apps on their phones.",1
1,"DON NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY
  
",23.Mar.19,Yes,"Worst purchase I_e ever made. Have a 1 out of 5 stars cuz she works MAYBE 1 out of 5 times. Set my whole house up with Alexa (lights, tv, outlets, etc..) and she hardly ever works. I have GREAT wifi connection and have spent a lot of money to make sure of it because Alexa always tells me my devices are not responding and to check connection. After spending hundreds of dollars on modems and the highest quality WiFi package she continues to do the same. I go to my apps to control from my phone and it works fine but Alexa doesn_ not, proving the problem is with Alexa. Also, if she does not hear you clearly, expect a 5 minute explanation of some movie or book named _ights at full volume at when you are trying to get up for work. Worst part is when she gets started she will not stop, even yelling _lexa at the top of your lungs will not stop her. You just have to wait it out while she wakes up the whole house. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.",1
4,"Set up is a pain in the ass, but once set up they are a lot of fun to use.
  
",23.Mar.19,Yes,"This was a complete pain in the ass to set up!  Just telling the end user to ""go to the alexa app and follow the directions is a really bad joke!  I spent over two hours trying to set this thing up and I was unable to do it following the app directions.  I had to have a friend, who has set up six of these units for his family, set mine up.  Even he had some problems making it connect.  Now that it is set up, I really enjoy using it.I have since, helped set up two units for my sister and a friend.  Before I did, I reviewed online videos on how to set them up and thought I knew what I was doing, but still they were a ""pain in the ass"" to get set up and connected.  I finally called the Amazon Echo Support phone number and a service guy walked us through the set up and we got the job done.  My advice to someone setting one of these units; down load the alexa app, plug in the Echo device then call the support line at 888-283-1678 and have the service person walk you through the set up process.  This can save you hours of frustration because Amazon techs don't know how to write instruction sheets that human beings can read and use.Besides the set up head aches, the units them selves are a lot of fun to have and easy to use.Amazon needs to put a written instruction sheet in the box that tells the end user:  The account names and passwords you need to have ready, the need to have a credit card on file with Amazon, then a step by step direction on how to set these things up.  I have other friends who are interested in purchasing one of these units, but they have heard how hard they are to set up and are intimidated and are afraid to buy one.Amazon:  Fix the set up problems with proper instructions!!!",0
4,"Understands a 2 (almost 3) year old
  
",24.Mar.19,Yes,"I like the idea of the echo dots.  I wish they were cheaper. I would only give it a 3.5 rating if I could, but I don't think a 3-star rating is justified.  I believe them to be worth the $30 I paid when it was on sale.  But anyway, that isn't the purpose of this review.Watch the video, it's cute. It is my almost 3 year old.  He loves to push the microphone button and ask Alexa what time it is.  The fact that Alexa can actually understand him is pretty cool if you ask me.  I know many adults who don't understand him when asking this question.  Good algorithm. :-)",0
2,"Sleek design, but awful microphone
  
",24.Mar.19,Yes,"I_e had an 2nd generation echo dot for a while, and I_e loved the features and smart home capabilities it brought! I decided to get a 3rd generation dot for my living room, as it would be nice to have a newer model and better speakers in a room that would get a lot of use. Unfortunately, it has not been as solid of a model as I_ hoped for, and I_e found that it_ worse than the 2nd generation model in many regards.First off, the package came dented, which wasn_ a huge deal, though I wonder if that caused some of the problems. The setup process had a solid amount of errors due to already having on echo dot on my account, where it just flat out didn_ work the first day and continued to say it was not fully set up even after finishing it within the app multiple times. Once it was up, I was pretty happy with the speaker, and it can sound pretty good for such a small device.The true problem is the microphone system. It almost never hears anyone, and you have to yell at it to get it to pick you up! Even then, it often mishears us and does something totally different than what we wanted. While it was funny the first time I was screaming _LEXA STOP! over it playing some music, it_ gotten a bit old now (but still kind of funny). We_e tried putting it in different places, but no luck.It_ a shame, because I really like the 2nd gen dot that I have, but this one just can_ compete because it can hardly hear anything. I_ hoping they improve the microphone in the future, but right now, it takes a major toll on the product.",0
5,"3-Months in and now here_ my realistic review
  
",24.Mar.19,Yes,"What_ not to like about it? (Besides the occasional miscommunication between you and your Alexa usually from mumbling or faulted pronunciation) From as simple yet convenient as a Bluetooth speaker with Apple login for any room, all the way to making calls/play games and trivia/turning on lights/locking doors/ closing blinds/ controlling outlets/ etc. The convenience is all too good to pass up! I bought 2 of the Echo Dots (3rd gen) the first week the 3rd gens were released. One for me and one for my mother. And she absolutely loves it! It_ an everyday used product for sheer convenience with anyone I_e ever known who owns an Alexa device. Definitely worth the purchase in my eyes!With that said, it_ bug fixes don_ come as often as a tech-y kind of person like I would like BUT they hardly run into any problems as far as I can tell from all of the Alexa devices I_e had. Like I said, miscommunication is number one problem as of now which hopefully will be managed someway/somehow. But as of now, just speak clearly haha. I have yet to experience any bad connections with any of my lights, outlets, or other Alexa devices with my Echo personally so I_ assume any review saying there are disconnection errors with external add-on devices would be because of either their poorly constructed third-party device or poor internet connection. Either way, I believe only what I see with my own eyes and what I see and perceive from my experience  so far is a well executed and designed Amazon device.For the great price they run it at, it really is worth the try!",0
4,"Good but has some issues.
  
",24.Mar.19,Yes,So far so good. I have multiples and enjoy the intercom feature. Only complaint is one of the 4 has an issue where the person on the other end hears an odd noise like feedback but only while they talk. Present from multiple devices contacting the one. Also get occasional devices dropped off the network and have to pull the plug and plug back in to get it to reconnect. I have purchased smart plugs to allow me to power them off and on remotely to remedy this.,0
5,"Better with multiples.
  
",25.Mar.19,Yes,"Love the newer echo dots, we have 3 in our house which is better than one as you can group them and listen to the same song through out the house and we use the drop in feature and we have cloud cams as well that will notify us through the echo dots if there is motion or glass breaking and so forth.At first I didn't like that the changed the plug in part cause the old echos required the same type of plug as a phone, its the same as a phone charger. But I did have issues with the connection being stable sometimes it would fall out and with this new echo dot the plug is secure and I have grown to like it much better.I have grouped my in to Multiple speaker group and now if I am cleaning it will play my music or audio books through out the whole house so if I move rooms I will still continue to be able to listen to my echo dots which makes things much more pleasant..There always updating Alexa with new things to try and privacy seems to have many people canceling or deregistering their echos but you can remove the stored audio on the Alexa and it is just used to help recognize your voice and helps the alexa get smarter, I like this feature as I dont have anything to hide anyways so this does not bother me what so ever.There are deals you can get through your echo by shopping on Amazon.com through the echo which I love a good deal. I once got $100 off a $300 cole hann purse, ecstatic! This was the discount from ordering with my Echo dot !You can also have conversations with your Alexa which is fun!Also it guards your house when your away like if it hears breaking glass or a smoke detector or a carbon monoxide detector go off it will alert your phone, I have pets at home and things like this mean the world to me I am very appreciative of this feature.Will continue to purchase this item and any newer generations as well.",0

",25.Mar.19,Yes,"I have been trying to figure out how to bring some decent sound into my bedroom and have tried a bunch of wireless smart speakers from Bose and Yamaha.  I was ok with both, but they were very expensive and the sound was no better (I think not as good)  than my very old Cambridge Soundworks CD740 tabletop radio.As an experiment I bought the Echo Dot and plugged it into the Aux of my Soundworks radio.  Perfect!  Sounds great with full Alexa functionality!For those of you looking to up the sound on your Echo ... this is the best and cheapest way to go.Get on Ebay and buy an old Soundworks or Bose tabletop radio and plug a Dot into it.  I'm not exaggerating that the sound on these old puppies is every bit as good or better than ANY (Sonos and Echo Plus included ... even with SUB) smart speaker.  I am now returning my Bose Speaker .... which I really think is very good ....  and buying another Soundworks radio for $50.  Total of about $100 for great sound and Alexa that you could not get new for less than $400-$500.",0

This version is slightly larger, definitely heavier, and so far has made it through several trips. I was very disappointed it did not fit into the same carry case as the previous versions, so I had to ditch my cute round pink case and get a clunky black case that fits this version.

",26.Mar.19,Yes,"Have 2 Echo Inputs connected to stereo systems, 3 Gen 2 Dots, and just purchased a Gen 3 Dot.  I have all set up as a group, ""Everywhere.""  We like to play music throughout the house and with everything connected, it has been great moving throughout the house and being able to hear the same thing.  The system runs for 8 hours or more per day.  Bought the Gen 3 DOT and it worked quite well, for a couple weeks.  At first, it would not start playing a song when all the others were playing, but would cut in a few seconds after the song started.  Then, it started just shutting off while the others still played.  Finally, after two or three songs, it would say it was having trouble playing the music and would shut down everything.  Contacted support, and received a replacement today.  Changed out the defective Gen 3 with the new one and all worked well, for a while.  However, the replacement now has started to just shut down after a couple hours.  Both of the new Gen 3 Dots seem to feel warmer to the touch than the older Gen 2s, so don't know if they are overheating after a couple hours or if there is another problem with them.  Thinking seriously about just requesting a refund on the Gen 3 and getting another Gen 2.  I do like the sound better on the newer Gen 3, but if it keeps shutting down, ..............  Will probably use it for a couple more days and see if the problem recurs or if maybe it was just an anomaly.",1

I_l just say that the setup experience is flawlessly easy, the unit looks good, and the sound is impressive.In order to get improved sound from the echo, you_l need to elevate it off the hard surface that it sits on to increase the bass effectiveness. There are a ton of 3D printable holders to make, some you can simply order, or if you_e lazy, just set it in the box it came in (empty it for best results). You may be impressed as well.",0

",26.Mar.19,Yes,"Initially I was skeptic about buying these but when I saw a '2 for $60' deal I went ahead and bought these. These are awesome little speakers. I fitted one in both my bedrooms and believe me they look small but have a great premium sound for little speakers and also gets the work done working as satellite smart speakers for my echo plus. I created a group for all the echo speakers and can play music from anywhere I want and it is great to hear all the speakers playing in sync. Gives a great surround sound feeling if setup correctly. Would have liked it more if it was possible for them to play in sync when connected with Bluetooth. As of now we can only connect them in sync if we are using some streaming service to play music. If used with bluetooth, only one speaker will play music that you have your bluetooth device connected to.

",27.Mar.19,Yes,"Easy to setup but echo takes multiple attempts to turn on the light that is connected to smart adapter (amazon brand or 3rd party brand. I tried both)Even after echo confirms the command by responding _k. Light still isn_ turned on.It takes 2-3 tries. One time it took 5 attempts to finally truly turn on the light.The voice recognization is becoming worse each day. It doesn_ respond to Alexa or Echo. Often we had to raise the voice loudly.It is not next to wall and it has problem hearing even during quiet night time.However, weird thing is that once it hears me the first time, then subsequent commands can be heard and acknowledged even with very low voice volume.Very inconsistent in responding wake command.Echo does not know most of questions asked. For example, can you recommend a national park to visit?Try google home. You will get better answers most of the time.Update:Received a call from Amazon to resolve the device issue. I requested to get a call back at a specific time but never received a call back.The device problem is still there and not getting better. It doesn_ respond often with first call of _lex. Repeating it with same tone, same voice level, and same direction and it responses second or 3rd time. Just not the first.Turning light on is still terrible that it ticks us off sometimes.

3,"Good product but sound is muffled
  
",28.Mar.19,Yes,"I received my first Echo as a gift from my adult children Christmas 2018. It was the Echo Show. After setting it up to play music, video, and control my home automation using Alexa, I decided to extend coverage to our bedroom with an Echo Dot. After reading a lot of reviews, it became apparent that the 3rd gen. was the way to go, so ordered it on my Prime account and waited for it for over 2 weeks. After receiving it, I found setting it up to be a breeze since it was set for my account when it arrived. After getting it setup on my WiFi, it readily accepted my voice commands and pretty much worked flawlessly. But soon after the initial setup, I noticed the sound seemed muffled... very difficult to understand Alexa, or hear any clarity of music. No problem I thought, I'll adjust the tone controls to fix the issue. After turning the treble all the way up, I could hear little or no difference. I'm still amazed at the low quality of sound I'm hearing. It's as if everything is sharply cutoff at about 3kHz. After reading many reviews about the improved sound quality of the 3rd. gen Dot, I'm starting to wonder if I may have received a defective unit. But if what I'm hearing is normal for this model, I can only wonder how bad the 1st and 2nd get Dots were. Many who might read this may wonder if I was expecting too much from this little $50 device especially after starting with the Echo Show which has excellent audio quality. My answer to them would be no, I'm a realist when it comes to expectations from various devices. I have to honestly say my iPhone has better audio quality than my Echo Dot. Sorry Amazon, I really like the Dot but it (mine) falls short of any average expectation of a device designed to do what it is supposed to do... let me hear it.",0
4,"Fun &amp; Interesting Gadget
  
",28.Mar.19,Yes,"I received Echo Dot as part of a promotion.I would never had ordered one but turns out it actually has some interesting skills like answering questions without asking Google or Siri as well as playing ambient sounds for relaxation.If you have a good quality bluetooth speaker you can pair it with the Echo dot for better sound quality.There is one skill, however, called Alexa Silver that I saw a video about but I have not been able to find it.It would allow me to wake up the echo dot with a variety of names like Alaina, Allegra, Aretha, Alisha, Alfonzo, Aldis, Arashel or Excederin.It's also supposed to have a listening mode that responds ""uh huh"" while you tell it stories.With this skill it can repeat itself or increase the volume for those of us who may be hearing impaired.I would recommend getting one of these.",0
3,"It's ok
  
",28.Mar.19,Yes,"The darn thing doesn't understand what I'm saying half the time. I have to use the app to find what I'm looking for most of the time. Sound quality is good. I haven't tried ordering anything on it. I'm very disappointed in the Prime Music. For what I pay for Prime, I feel Amazon Music should be included. I'm very disappointed in that respect. Unless you buy your music or pay for Amazon Music, you're going to be limited to only playing a random selection from an artist or group. You aren't going to be able to find one album and chances are you aren't even going to find the one song you want to hear. The latter is the reason for a 3 star rating. In my opinion, paying $9.99 a month for Prime and if I want to find the songs or album I want to hear, I have to pay an additional $8.99 a month for Amazon Music is just a way for Amazon to soak you for more money.",0
5,"Especially Great for me in Recovery Phase Post-Op Total Knee Replacement
  
",28.Mar.19,Yes,"For some years, I had used a network, using the Apple Airport router and multiple pods called _pple Airport Express to play music through multiple sets of speakers throughout the house. They worked well for a while but I did have to reset them a couple of times. When Comcast upgraded their routers, the Apple router seemed redundant and the Airport Express network became more problematic. When Amazon released it_ Echo dot and Google released it_ _ome Mini, I was interested in both as possible replacements for the Airport Express. The decision was pretty easy when I realized the Google Home Mini did not have a mini jack for speakers. I bought our first Echo Dot.The set-up was fairly straight forward and even easier to use than the Airport Express setup had been. We could just ask Alexa to play whatever music we wanted to hear without having to open up a computer and iTunes. During the Christmas season, the price dropped below $30, so I bought two more. Over time, I bought a couple outlets and was able to connect all the lights in the living room so that I could just tell Alexa to _urn on all the lights. This was much easier than turning on the lights individually or putting them on timers as I had done previously.So, at this point, I had music and lights connected which were convenient and fun. Then I added a Nest _mart thermostat. We loved being able to control the thermostat without having to go downstairs to adjust it. I could adjust it from my iPhone or just ask Alexa to turn up the heat or turn it down. Adjusting the temp verbally through Alexa was not without problems at times. You have to be very exact in what you say and how you say it to Alexa. It was really easier just to use the iPhone to make adjustments as I always have that close by.I am a senior on multiple medications for this and that and when my doctor changed the schedule of some of my meds from evening to morning, it was hard for me to get into the new habit of taking them in the morning. I found myself forgetting to take them on some days altogether. This was solved by asking Alexa to remind me to take my meds every morning. If I am home, she verbally tells reminds me to take my meds. If I_ traveling, I get a notification on my iPhone. This has been great.But the real reason I am writing this review at all is to talk about how all of this technology was invaluable after having a total knee replacement this year.After I came home from surgery, I was pretty much upstairs in our home most of the time. I don_ know if it was the pain meds or what, but one minute I was hot and sweaty and the next minute I was cold. Being able to adjust the thermostat whenever needed from my bed was wonderful.I was doing a lot of tossing and turning in bed that first week after surgery and getting up multiple times to use the bathroom during the night. My husband was sleeping in the den as there was no way he could get any sleep with all of my activity. We left the bedroom door open and the door to the den open so that we could hear each other but I realized that I could go onto the Alexa app and use that to _rop in to the den, where he was sleeping like an intercom, rather than shouting. I could do the same _rop in to the living room and to the kitchen.During that first week home after surgery, I woke up and needed to get up to use the bathroom. The walker was next to the bed and bathroom only a few feet away. Usually, I used my left leg, the non-surgical leg, to gently lift my right leg, the surgical leg, off the bed and then gently down to the floor. Once, both feet were on the floor, then, using the walker, I had no problem getting to the bathroom.For some reason, maybe due to sedation of the pain med or just impatience, I moved a bit too quickly to get up. I did not support my right leg with the left foot as I had been doing and when the knee bent because of this, excruciating pain shot through my body and I lurched back, trying to land on the bed but instead of landing on the bed, I landed on a folding table which broke in two pieces, and then a plastic wastebasket that was under the folding table and then finally onto a machine that pumps ice water around the surgical site. Water went all over the floor. I had kept my leg straight and had not fallen directly onto the floor because the table, wastebasket and ice water machine broke my fall but I was stunned and started shouting for my husband in the den. He was sound asleep.I saw my iPhone on the edge of the bed, logged onto the Alexa app and _ropped in to the den and shouted for help. He woke up and came in and found me on the floor and helped me back into bed. I_ not sure what I would have done in that situation without Alexa and that _rop in feature. The next day, I ordered our fourth Echo Dot for the bedroom so if there was ever a problem n the future, I would not even need to find my iPhone.In conclusion, I highly recommend the versatile Echo Dot. I love the reminder features that keep me on track with me meds. I love the ability to just play music on request. I have recently been having Alexa read me the book, _ Handmaid_ Tale. And of course, I LOVE the _rop in feature.",0

But I am afraid that I am going to have to switch to a system that has a better long and proven track record when it comes to voice recognition, control, and personal assistant.  Sorry Amazon.

",28.Mar.19,Yes,"And be trapped forever. I had to reset this thing because my roommate trolled me and I had to reset it to quit the game. What an easter egg...Pretty cool to be able to use this to turn on lights, get answers to random questions, and know when packages have arrived. But past that, I don't have much use for it...It will randomly turn on. Which is disturbing.It also responds to ""Golexo"". So it must be going through an identity crisis.",0
5,"Very compact, Great range, Easy set up!
  
",28.Mar.19,Yes,"Excellent quality and sound rang. My house isn't that big, only 1400 square feet, but I'm impressed by its ability to pick up my voice from the kitchen into the living room without any trouble. Fully and easily integrated into my audio/video set up and for the Mooney, a very good investment. I truly believe they will become better and better as time progresses, as most electronics do, but at this stage, it's compact size and ease of set up its a winner for me!",0
3,"Sound not that gr6
  
",28.Mar.19,Yes,At first I was really enjoying my dot. Our whole fa liked asking it questions and listening to music. I have it in our bathroom because our 3 year old daughter likes listening to nursing rhymes and sin in the bathroom tub. We have the volume about halfway up and the speaker sounds like it's blown out?! We only had it about 4 months. At first I was thinking about getting one for each level of the house. But now that it sounds so crappy....I think I'll stick with my Bose speaker.,0
1,"Arlo owners beware!
  
",29.Mar.19,Yes,"This device has a long way to go. I like the drop in feature, and the smart home features, but the main reason why I bought it was to control my Arlo cameras (Mainly just turning on or off.)  The only way to view a camera is to have some sort of Amazon fire tv or echo show device.  It doesn_ even allow you to view the cameras on your phone using the Alexa App. Regardless if you have fire tv or similar device, It doesn_ turn cameras on/off or arms/disarms camera. If you have a LG TV, you can control the TV except turning it on. Not sure if that_ a Alexa or LG issue, but other brand TVs work. I can live without the TV issue, but Amazon needs to fix the Arlo issue!",2
5,"Excellent buy. Can't stop at just one!
  
",29.Mar.19,Yes,"Absolutely love this. I bought several for my home including a sub, I use it every day. I know some people have a problem with the Amazon echo because they believe that Amazon is listening in and recording what they say, and I don't think this is exactly denied by Amazon either. The seems to make a lot of people nervous, however when you think about it it's not that much different from having your smartphone on you. Your smart phone can listen, and track you with GPS, what difference is it by having an echo in your house? If you want to get away from anyone that can listen, leave all electronics and take a walk in the woods. As far as this Echo goes, it works very very well. Sometimes, I have noticed that I need to word things a little bit differently in order to get the result I want, which seems a little silly, however I have acclimated quite well in order to get it to do what I want. For such a small little thing, it has an amazing speaker in it. It plays really really well, and with the echo subwoofer it is amazing. The only thing I've really noticed about the echo Dot, is that on max volume the speaker doesn't have as great of sound. But considering that max volume is absurdly loud anyways, I usually don't put it that high at all and I never have any issues with sound. I have also noticed that sometimes the echo doesn't want to give commands to other third-party apps such as robot vacuums, there's been a lot of problems with it. But nonetheless this has been an amazing device and I have been very pleased with it so far.",0
5,"Cheaper than the competitors and works better too!
  
",29.Mar.19,Yes,"Our first experience with a smart speaker was a Google Home. It had a nice app and it did some things, but we had to repeat _kay google! 5 times before it even heard us. We repositioned it, we reset it, recalibrated the voice commands, etc and nothing really helped. It was too late to return/exchange it by the time we decided it might be a hardware issue, so into the bathroom it went to be used as a music player.Then comes Alexa. Easier to use and set up, and the physical buttons are easier to use than Google_ (admittedly cool) fabric touch surface. She can hear us calling out her name in the nosiest situations, and I_e gotten so comfortable with using her that I don_ even look for the lights to see if she_ picked up on my voice anymore. I just call out a command and she follows without fault every time!We_e got her hooked up to my Prime account to deliver us notifications and place orders, she_ connected to our thermostat, she can turn on my TV, and we_e got her connected to Smart Outlets to control lights and appliances. I_e almost even forgotten that Siri exists on my phone now!I love out Dot so much that I_e been using them as gifts for practically any occasion. They_e incredibly helpful and I_ excited to expand her abilities and even place a few more Dots around the house.If you_e looking for a smart speaker, I seriously can_ imagine anything better than this. Just try out a Dot! You won_ be disappointed.",0

",29.Mar.19,Yes,I got the product nov with google home mini to validate what is better ... 95thday my echo dot went dead... I contacted the amazon support... they simply said it_ more than 90 and they can offer a promotional credit of 15%.... and they even closed my report saying it solved .... bad customer service and cheap product.... google home mini is better ... it goes good,2
2,"Got worst over time
  
",29.Mar.19,Yes,"I_e been using this echo dot dice the beginning of December. It had been great originally when I first got it. For some reason nowadays Alexa doesn_ hear me call her or when she does turn on, she will just beep and turn off. I tried an air blaster to clean it and everything but it either doesn_ hear me or just do what I want it to when it does. It has been happening for about a month and it isn_ every time. It was very clear and responsive when I first got it. It still works but it has become a hassle and some what annoying. I expected better from an amazon product.",0
5,"What you don't know....
  
",29.Mar.19,Yes,"I bought this as a Christmas gift and we set it up in the kitchen. It worked for 2 months then stopped working.  We_e tried going to the app as she directs, but nothing has worked. We are owners of the Echo Show, Spot, and black dot too, so we were really bummed when this one was faulty.  Come to find out, the Dots come with really awesome customer service that walk you through the issues.  It's just needed to be reset.  We are back in action......Alexa.",0
4,"The sound is OK, but nothing like the much better Alexa 2nd generation.
  
",30.Mar.19,Yes,"I originally got the Alexa 2nd generation for my main area the living room but soon realized that although the sound was great, I didn't like walking from room to room and not have the music going so I purchased the Dot. It does the trick and it is great when you link it with your Alexa 2 so you tell it to play ""whatever EVERYWHERE"" or whatever you decide to call the group. It is great that I have the dot in my kitchen, but now I want another for my bedroom as well for the same reason as the kitchen. I don't need one in my bathroom for Pete sake, that would be wasted money in my opinion unless you want music while you have a bath or something! I don't like the sound so much, but it is better than nothing and for the price I can hook up my whole house with the same group and enjoy the same tunes everywhere in the house! Only gave it 4 not 5 stars due to ""ok"" quality speakers, not great ones. What do you expect for a $50 product though. I heard they went down in price but can't find out where or I would purchase my next Dot there!",0
4,"Do not download the AP fro the App store.
  
",30.Mar.19,Yes,"Followed directions to install.  Tried to download the Alexa AP.  It failed to download.  A phone number is given on the web page to get help, when diAled ""THAT NUMBER IS NO LONGER IN SERVICE"". NOW THAT IS SPECIAL!  I tried to send a message for on line help and no one is available.  Not a very good start.he next day I tried again, the program still failed to download, so I again called the suggested number.  This started my nightmare.  I spoke to what appeared to be a very helpful ""Amazon tech""  she stated that I had a problem with my wifi and that Alexa had detected a problem with my computer.  She assurred me that she could fix it  After 30 minutes of back and forth and taking over my computer she cheerfully declared that she could fix this by removing all the illegal websites that had invaded my computer.  The cost $295.  I spelled a problem and hung up, then deleated what I could from my computer files.  Later on I called Amazon directly and the very nice young lady who assisted my and Alexa was working in 15 minutes.  I am still in the process of learning but so far I am pleased.  So, it is vey important to not down load this app from the app store!",0

5,"Great sound and app caveat
  
",30.Mar.19,Yes,"Alexa is now playing Abba and I didn't have to pay for a download! The Echo Dot is great. Caveat: identifying the correct app for setup was a supreme challenge. The correct app is subtitled ""music"" and that immediately told me keep looking for the setup app. In no way would I download a music app. NOT! The app labeled ""music"" IS the setup app. Setting up the Dot was anything but intuitive. This app needs reworking. Very few setup prompts along the way. It was 95% guesswork so plan on trying this or that link to find the next logical setup step. I finally had to call the HELP desk and she walked me through the whole process. Exceptional help from the HELP Desk. Thank you for that Amazon! I was close to putting it back in the mail today.",0
4,"Delayed response from Alexa
  
",30.Mar.19,Yes,"I love my 2nd generation echo dot, so I purchased a 3rd generation dot for my bedroom.  I definitely like the sound of the speaker on the 3rd generation; however, there is often a several second delay in the response of the 3rd generation.  It is annoying since I don't know if Alexa heard me or not.  I have both of them in a group together and today the 2nd generation would start playing music before the 3rd generation would start playing.  I am not sure how the 3rd generation went downhill in response time over the 2nd generation.  I would have assumed it would have improved.",0
3,"Glad I didn_ pay for this
  
",31.Mar.19,Yes,I received this freebie through a Siriusxm promotion. I downloaded the Alexa appon my iphone but I cannot get it to pair with my phone.  I_ done getting myself aggravated trying to do it. This will be packed back in the box and stored someplace where I don_ have to see it. It peeves me off because I_ pretty technologically literate.I_ glad I didn_ have to pay for this piece of junk.UPDATE: I did manage to get it paired and set up but not with the horrible instructions sent to me. It took a lot of googling. The sound quality is ok but not as good as my Bose Mini-link speaker. I'm disappointed that this thing isn't wireless (meaning you need to plug it in all the time). It's good enough to set up in my bathroom.,0
5,"Speaker is not as good as the Echo, but good for smaller room
  
",31.Mar.19,Yes,"I have an Amazon Echo and love it.  I got the Echo Dot for the bedroom.  I have tried to connect them for multi room use, but the instructions are hard for me to follow.  Someone more tech-savvy would probably easily understand.  I may have to ask my Grand children for help!  Anyway I was a little disappointed with the sound after the larger Echo, but I had a Bose CD/Radio that I had had for years.  The speakers on it are still excellent, so I connected the Echo Dot to the Bose (with the help of my son) and the sound is awesome.  I love this little dot and may get some help to connect so that I can play the same music in multiple rooms!  However, for now it sounds great!  If you want bigger sound, go for the Echo.",0
5,"The sound is amazing!
  
",31.Mar.19,Yes,"I have several Echo and Alexa devices. I always bought an extra speaker for my dots - until now. This is an astounding little gizmo and I love it. I will be replacing all of them within the next week. Alexa keeps getting better and better. I am very glad I stuck to kindle, fire TV, echo, and Alexa smart stuff. It keeps things standardized and it seems to me that they are the best in the field of 3. I can't WAIT for the Alexa car device to be released!",0
4,"Sound quality not as good and not as quick to respond as Echo Dot 2
  
",1.Apr.19,Yes,"I don't use a lot of the capabilities, but the sound quality is very muffled on the Echo Dot 3 when listening to the spoken word.  Its OK for music, but I purchased a compatible speaker which is far superior.  It connects instantly with Bluetooth so it compensates for the lack of sound quality in the Dot 3.However, one thing that is disappointing is that its not nearly as responsive as the Echo Dot 2. That one hears me from anywhere in the apartment at a normal speaking voice (scary sometimes......) and instantly responds. I have to stand almost in front of the Dot 3, look directly at it and give it directions. I have to speak louder as well to get its attention. Its also slower to respond to commands.  Its like the fabric outside  muffles the sound so its less responsive. I can certainly live with it, I was just expecting an improvement of the 3 over the 2, but that isn't the case.  Amazon, please restore the instant responsiveness capability of the Dot 2 to the Dot 4.",0
1,"First impression is this could be good.
  
",1.Apr.19,Yes,"Speaker quality leaves a bit to be desired. Voice recognition is also mediocre. Ease of use rates high once you get the thing to understand you. Still exploring features and will edit when we have a better idea of how we're doing to use this.Edit: This device keeps attempting to steer my selection of music to Amazon Cloud Music service which it says is set as default. I prefer Spotify and even when there is a spotify selection available, alexa says it can't find it and tries to get me to subscribe to Amazon music. To hell with that and screw Jeff Bezos. Demoted to one star for intrusive decisions it makes on your behalf. Would give it zero if that was possible.",0

",1.Apr.19,Yes,Love it! And thank you for the free plug offer with it!I already have a spot and needed a hub so I got the dot to help me a little more around the house lol. There_ a portable charger and speaker for the spot but was a bit too much so I went ahead and grabbed this amazon deal c:I_ not sure why anyone says it_ (dot) not loud enough. Maybe it_ just me but I hear it just fine. Great in big rooms. I_ not looking for a sound bar just a nice ranged speaker. Also has a nice bass! The spot however is lower sound quality so this is a great add!Loving my growing smart home &lt;3,0
5,"GREAT PRODUCT!
  
",1.Apr.19,Yes,"Already have the Echo Plus. Bought this for upstairs. Could not believe how good music sounds on both devices. AND I synchronize the music upstairs and dow. It was super easy to install. The only thing I haven't been able to do is to control the turning on and off of the Hue light bulb. It wouldn't respond, but I've been too busy to go back thru the steps needed. Also one must have one's smartphone to do it. I keep forgetting to take it with me. I also don't order anything from Amazon using either Echo. The process is either too confusing or else I'm just too dim to do it successfully.",0
2,"Static noise  after four months.
  
",1.Apr.19,Yes,I did get the echo dot with the purchase of SiriusXM radio.  It really stinks though that it started to break down just a month after my 90 day warranty expired...  static and Buzzing whenever you play anything on it.  Called and they said the best they can do is offer me $15 off of a new Echo Dot yeah no thanks probably won_ buy it again.  I_l stick apple...,1
4,"Work unit...
  
",1.Apr.19,Yes,"I purchased this unit for my job because...it was on sale. I really liked this 3rd gen because they upgraded the speaker and my music was clear and had depth. I could put this unit on 2 without disrupting anyone around me. Unfortunately, while I've been traveling for work someone has been using it because I came back today and the speaker is blown.  Anything with bass is distorted and tinny sounding.  If I find out who blew my speaker I'm going to make them buy me a new one!!!",0
3,"Alone, it's more gimmick than tool
  
",2.Apr.19,Yes,"So, it's all fine and dandy. It works. But, I'm not willing to give it access to my ordering, because then it can be messed with too easily. I had it connected to my contacts until I thought about how bad an idea that is. The fact is, if I had four of these and a full size Echo along with a FireTV control unit and a bunch of smart plugins/bulbs/etc., then it could be a useful tool. But, by itself, it's just a gimmick. It's nice to hear a joke and be able to play music, but I have other mechanisms for music (have to upgrade my Sirius account to integrate with Alexa, don't listen enough to make Spotify a good deal...). Anyway, as part of a complete system of home components, probably great. As a stand alone item in the living room, kind of annoying to have it flashing at me that I have notifications when I've already received a text message and an email from Amazon telling me my package is being delivered.",1
4,"So far so good!
  
",2.Apr.19,Yes,"I visited an Airbnb a few weeks ago that had an Echo playing meditation music in my room during my stay. I LOVED it.I've never actually been much for listening to music without lyrics, or listening to music while doing activities, but boy did this change my mind. It was a great way to relax and keep my anxiety lower during the day, and to soothe me into a bedtime mood at night. I liked it so much that after a week of arguing with myself, I went ahead and bought my own Echo Dot.I'm still not fully briefed on all it's uses, and I haven't used most of it's features. I'm a little cheesed that I can't access all music everywhere without paying a monthly fee, but in retrospect I'm not surprised they pulled that on users...But when all I have to do is say ""Alexa, play meditation music"", ""Alexa, play classical music"", ""Alexa, turn off"" to get relaxing music without a bright screen or fiddling with a device or charging something or taking up a lot of space (I'm looking at you, boom box/radio), this just makes me so happy! Also, it's a really attractive little device.I'm not sure yet how well it may or may not travel with me, and I still haven't used it for anything else, but at the moment I'm pretty happy!",0
5,"The easy use of it. I take it with me when 8 travel.
  
",2.Apr.19,Yes,For traveling use. It_ compact and easy. I have it so I can play my car XM satellite radio through it. Love it. I have the Echo Show and 2 Echoes in my home. I use the music on the every group. It_ so cool. I will be happy when you can use different music on each one. That_ the only draw back with Amazon music. My children listen to different music based on their age. I love Country they love other music. So Mom wins at this point. Please Amazon allow different Echos in your home to play different music at the same time.,0
4,"Considerably Better
  
",2.Apr.19,Yes,We own a fleet of the older dots. I got this one to replace one that seemed to have a hard time staying on my network.No network problems yet!New device seems heavier and better made that the old ones.

5,"Adds a lot of convenience to this nanny_ life
  
",2.Apr.19,Yes,"I really love this product, and it_ made my life as a live-in nanny a lot easier.I have a lot to keep track of in my life, and honestly the feature/skill to be able to play sounds for sleep has made a huge difference. I use it as my alarm, I use the morning start feature and have my calendar linked as well; then at night it_ helped improve my quality of sleep greatly- especially since it doesn_ play continuously.I also love that I can get notifications for my packages like I do on my phone, since I_ not always around it (nor do I feel a small sense of panic if I_ not _ust in case anymore) and the drivers don_ always knock or ring the bell.

",3.Apr.19,Yes,"This is my 4th echo added to the house. I_e had the 1st gen in my bedroom for quiet some time and when I found the deal for the echo and smart plug I just had to grab it. Compared to the first echo it_ much better sound improvement. A little smaller then the first generation but sound is way better. We use our echo to tell us the weather outside. Ask it silly questions and of course music so with the upgraded speaker it really makes a huge difference. Set up was a breeze and works just as good as the others. I have it synced up with my smart lights (I have the philips hue, but there_ cheaper choices out now). I_ constantly asking Alexa to turn and off lights. I also use the IFTTT (if this then that app) seriously.. it_ amazing! Alexa trigger bedtime and my bedroom lights turn off. My front door light and kitchen lights turn on at certain times to make it seem as someone is home. Also turns them off at times. I love how well everything works together.",0

",3.Apr.19,Yes,"Day 1 and I love this more than I thought I would. I think I may even pay the 3.99 a month for the music cause it_ nice to have access to whatever and my baby needs white noise to fall asleep. I plan on buying one for each room. I can take and place calls, ask for reminders and recipes. I can listed to music and play audio books. I can also communicate with other rooms like _ell Isaac in the baby_ room I need help and it will pass along the message. I have never wanted a smart house SO BAD. This was never my dream before I got this product. I was between google and Amazon but 1. Google is evil and 2. Alexa sounds hot....

1,"Regret
  
",3.Apr.19,Yes,I was looking for a full apartment speaker system and these very affordably filled that role. Amazon's prime music doesn't have everything but it does have enough that I managed to build a 16 hour playlist without anything beyond my prime subscription. The ability to sync them together and play the same music throughout my home was the big selling point and I will be adding an additional one or two more before too long.The only reason it did not get the full 5 stars if that the volume control is flaky. Some songs are too loud and others too quiet. The voice commands to change the volume are not granular enough so it goes from one extreme too the other most of the time.*Edited after months of use*There is something to be said for brand new electronics that are only backed by a 30 day warranty and it isn't good. They need to be rebooted frequently or else they will run too slow to be useful at all and 1/3 has already had a power supply fail which of course happened outside of the 30 day joke if a warranty. I'll need to read the fine print better next time certainly won't be buying anything more complicated than cables with Amazon's name on it.,0
1,"Buyer beware
  
",3.Apr.19,Yes,"There are major software  glitches every single day: from repeated volume control reduction to the lowest setting (without command) to music playback suddenly stopping or skipping songs in the middle of them, the subwoofer cutting out and/or one or two random speakers dropping off the _ulti-room playback function. There are so many bugs, I_e had nothing but trouble with this system. I purchased the echo stereo sub combo AND 2 extra echo dots for whole house sound system (that_ 4 speakers and a sub). I don_ know if I_ asking the system to perform functions that are maxing out its capabilities but I am using the system in the manner that amazon advertised it to function, so I expect it to be able to perform as advertised.  I have only owned my system for 4 months and Its been awful. I spent over 350$ and the system works about 50% of the time. I would NOT recommend to anyone.I_ fact, I_ love a refund if possible.",0

",3.Apr.19,Yes,"This is the only generation I have ever owned so I_ not able to compre it to past generations but this makes such a wonderful little stereo. I use to it listen to my audiable books and music when I_ studying or working. I still have yet to fully figure out how to permanently connect it to two phone devices without it always disconnecting. The skills are also difficult to connect as well. My pandora skill is already activated through the phone app but it still won_ play when I ask Alexa to play pandora. Other than that, it meets all of my expectations.",0

",4.Apr.19,Yes,"I received this item as a promotion from a company so I didn't need to pay for it and I'm glad I didn't. I had this product for approximately 3 months and I really like it. I used a few of it's features but the one I used most was the noise for sleeping.  To be fair, I did use it just about everyday and it worked very well during that time. It did not last long as the speaker on it went out in a very short period of time. I contacted customer support by email to see if there was anything they could offer me in regards to replacing it. The email told me the warranty expired (after 3 months?). It also stated there may be something they can do anyway and I should call their phone service to verify info. I did that and after a short hold time was told the best they could do was a 15% discount on buying a new echo product. To me this device is not too expensive but it wasn't something that I really needed in my life so even with a discount it's not worth replacing especially it if will just go out in 3 months again. For me this is just a little annoying, But if I did integrate this into my life more I would be quite livid.",1
5,"Worth the upgrade
  
",4.Apr.19,Yes,"Hi. Went from 2nd generation to 3rd. Thought I would have to reset everything. It all fell into place right away. No password needed etc. It saw all my routines with no hassles. I did have to re-find my Bluetooth speakers. But that was a breeze. It weighs more than 2nd gen. Listens BETTER. Hence, no yelling at her, repeatedly.I got white but suggest you don't. Fyi. Just a matter of preference!  The speaker in it is an improvement. Less tinny.  Hence the weight. The power cord is longer and the power supply is rated at 15 watts.I got the deal of the century. A 3rd generation and Amazon smart plug for 49 bucks. VERY happy and recommend it . I think it's worth considering. CRAIG _",0
2,"Static
  
",4.Apr.19,Yes,After 3 months  of use of the speaker started to be staticky and distort the music . It plays well for about an hour now before the static starts. My older generation echo products still work great so I_ very disappointed with this 3 rd generation echo dot.,2
5,"Great Product, many uses
  
",4.Apr.19,Yes,"We are loving this device, make our life so easy! The dot has a great volume, but if is on volume 6 or more Alexa won't hear, so you can get closer, yell or get the mic control. To get up or down the volume you just need to say alexa volume # (the volume goes from 1-10). The skill are great, you can do meditation, exercises, etc. My daughter uses to set timers for her piano practice and to be on time in the mornings. So far so good. Great product Amazon. Customer services is really the best!",0
2,"A review of the device not Alexa. Microphone sucks... that aside
  
",5.Apr.19,Yes,I'd review Alexa but I feel she is adequate this is purely my feelings about the current gen Echo Dot.I've had this(5 months) and the 2nd generation (1yr and 5months) for sometime now and I can honestly say I'm not overly impressed with the third generation. I had the 2nd gen in my bathroom and the 3rd in my kitchen. Walking through the front door the 2nd gen two rooms away was more likely to pick up my voice than the 3rd gen that was much closer and on top of a counter so it could be unreconstructed. The speaker is about the only thing I really have liked about this Dot as the 2nd gen was definitely really weak. I almost wonder if the mic on my 3rd gen in particular is just damaged. Even freshly unpacked the microphone was weak. It is so poor and the 2nd gen mic so good I had to move the 2nd gen to a back room where wifi is weaker but I can close a door so it won't pick up my voice.As a home assistant it is more important to have a functioning microphone than a speaker. Speakers can be bought and/or added on. Microphones can't.,1
4,"Stuff you won't read elsewhere
  
",5.Apr.19,Yes,"There are hundreds of reviews for this version so I won't just repeat the obvious or gush about how it is the best thing that ever happened to my life. I'm just going to say a couple of things that aren't usually mentioned.One is why I replaced my old original Dot. She was going deaf. I have several Dots but for some reason the one on my kitchen counter was having trouble hearing me, she would either ignore me or keep saying she didn't understand me. I finally figured out that all of the microphones are tiny holes on top of the device and just like an old man's ears they would clog up with dust and kitchen grease and gunk to the point I had to get a divorce - um, from her - and look for a younger model.My new model is more attractive and curvy and sensuous and speaks in a low sultry voice. And that's actually not good. One of the brilliant things about the original design was that Alexa's voice was sharp and shrill and could cut through the commotion of household noise. My new Alexa by comparison sounds muffled, like she has a paper bag over her head. She can hear me fine, better than the old model, but now I can't understand her.Comparing the white color to the first generation there are pros and cons.  First off the new generation is all white with a white cord and white power supply.  The original had a white body but the top, cord and transformer were all black.  I have mixed feeling about that. It does look more contemporary but the mesh side and matte finish on top show dust and fingerprints much more than the older model and already after a few days it is looking a bit dingy.  And as much as I like the new power cord the transformer is substantially larger, it actually prevents me from using the outlets on either side of it on my power strip.One final thing, you would think with all the money and time spent on developing this product they could have figured out how not to make the two jacks on the back identical in size and shape. The original model had a mini USB power port, the new one has a small round connector that looks just like an audio jack. The user shouldn't be forced to think about which one is the power port and which is the external speaker port.",0

5,"How did I live without Alexa?
  
",6.Apr.19,Yes,"I have this Echo Dot in my kitchen and I love Alexa! When I make my morning coffee, I listen to my flash briefing. Before I leave for work, Alexa tells me the weather for the day. When I_ cooking, Alexa can set a timer for me when my hands are dirty. Alexa reminds me every Saturday morning to water my plants. I can create grocery lists with Alexa and the list will be on my phone when I_ at the grocery store. Alexa can play my music from Spotify or play numerous playlists from amazon music. I personally like the cooking with classic soul I think it_ called. You can play games/quizzes with Alexa and she can tell you nerdy or corny jokes, which are funny to me.",0
4,"3 Month Warranty - Consider carefully
  
",6.Apr.19,Yes,"Update: apparently the speaker sounded blown out because of a software issue that was eventually resolved. Updating star rating to 4 stars for this review to reflect my overall opinion of the device and that this issue was eventually resolved- - - -I bought a 3rd generation echo dot 6 months ago. I woke up this morning to the alarm and the speaker was blown out. The volume has never been higher than 7/10 using the actual speakers on the device. Amazon has a 3 month warranty on the echo dot, so they would not offer me a replacement or fix. The customer service representative offered me a 15% discount on a new echo dot. I would be happy to give the product another chance for without paying more than I already have, but I_ not interested in buying a second echo dot in the hope that one of them will work longer than 6 months. Consider carefully before buying any Amazon branded electronics, Amazon doesn_ appear to trust its devices to work longer than 3 months, why should we?!",1
5,"Our household gives these 5 stars! We love them.
  
",6.Apr.19,Yes,"I think we have 6 of these. 3 bedrooms, Kitchen, Dining Room and gym. My son says he loves he can walk anywhere in the house and use Alexa. We also subscribed to the Family Music Plan so we use that quite often. I can walk into my gym and tell alexa to play my work out music play list and that right there sold me! I used to have to keep an Ipod down there and now don't have to fool with that. I also paired to a big speaker and that makes it very loud...I just wish it would pair to my surround sound in the gym..that would make it even better.",0
5,"Got it for the exteranl Audio Output
  
",6.Apr.19,Yes,I was thinking about getting the Alexa device that you use your own speakers.  Then I read one of the reviews and the person said that was a waist of money and I should get the dot because it has the external audio output.  I have several amazon echos however this is my first dot.  The 3rd generation has a lot of bang for $40.I hooked this think to my stereo with a male 1/8 to male RCA adapter.  Now I can listen to my amazon music as loud as I want.  Amazon listened to people with that external audio output.  I think that was a wise decision.,0
5,"So glad I did!
  
",6.Apr.19,Yes,"So far, this product far exceeds my expectations.  Alexa is smarter than Siri and it_ fun to play daily trivia questions and having her turn off lights and answer so many questions.  I like that she can control my LG TV - however, she cannot turn it on because it needs the Wi-Fi connection to make it work.  So, don_ blame Alexa or the TV - it_ logic - no Wi-Fi connection - she can_ turn the TV on - once it is on - she does everything the remote can do - excellent purchase and so far very happy with it!",0
3,"Warranty issues.
  
",6.Apr.19,Yes,"I bought a pair of these Echo 3s in January.  One has worked well and I can move it from room to room as needed.  The second has never worked properly.  In trying to replace it , I find Alexa reporting that I have 90 days, the website reporting 60 days, and the sales slip reporting 30 days.  Hmmm.  I guess Amazon does not have confidence in this product.  30, 60, or 90 is a very short warranty period no matter how you look at it.  I am not unhappy with the Echo that works but, since I can't return the defective one, I will check out the Google product and see how it compares.",0
5,"Love her!
  
",6.Apr.19,Yes,"Love her! I wish i would if bought her sooner. She's great compamy! Love asking her the news. She tells me what the weather is beforehand. Then I ask her each night to turn on my bedroom light, when my dog runs in there before me. She can play some piano for my pets while I'm away, ask me trivia questions when I'm bored, oh and I love when her light blinks, notifying me if Amazon shipments delivered. I could go on. =D",0

",6.Apr.19,Yes,"I bought one of these for a Xmas gift for my wife since we bought this one we have bought 7 more of these and 2 of the taller ones and wonder how we got along with out them. We use them for alarm locks, to control the tv, to control the smart lights we have and to control our ecobee thermostat. The tall ones work great with Sirius Radio and the sound is real good. Would purchase more but think I have enough of them",0
1,"Not good for medical reminders
  
",7.Apr.19,Yes,"Purchased for verbal medication routine reminders due to poor memory. My reminder setup was double-checked to ensure the test's accuracy.* echo doesn't understand me well, so I had to type in reminders* Mispronounces words typed in*Limits length of reminders so my noon medication instructions took five reminders spaced a minute apart.* If your medication routine needs to be repeated multiple times a day it does not give you the option of doing so without having to retype everything all over again.* Because the setup is cumbersome, I decided to just see how the noon cuing went; by the fourth day echo was only giving me 2 of the 5 midday reminders.*A reminder I set to begin a change in my medication routine began 9 days earlier than scheduled",1
1,"Failed after 5 months
  
",7.Apr.19,Yes,"My device failed after 5 months and Amazon does not stand behind these devices. They offered to give me a 15% discount to buy another one. When I told the rep that they were on sale for 20% off yesterday and I purchased it for 50% off originally she told me that I could also trade it in to get another 25% off. I had some problems with his device early on and didn't immediately ask for a replacement because I assumed Amazon stood behind there products. It would work again after I unplugged it and it restarted, but then it completely failed and died. On top of that, the link in the order says a replacement may be available for up to one year, which is not true. Google Home has a one year warranty.  The 1st and 2nd Gen Alexas have a one year warranty, but the 3rd gen has a 90 day warranty. Ask yourself why Amazon would change the warranty for substantially less time if the device was really an improvement over the 1st and 2nd gen devices. I own several of Alexas, but I certainly won't be buying more.",1
5,"Vast improvement!
  
",7.Apr.19,Yes,"I was an early adopter of the Echos and have used Gen 1 (Echo), Gen 2 (Echo &amp; Echo Dot), and now Gen 3 (Echo Dot).  I will say that this Gen 3 Echo Dot is a VAST improvement over the Gen 2.  I still have some Gen 2 interspersed with my Gen 3s and the sound quality is multiple steps of improvement over Gen 2.  I can finally use just one Gen 3 Echo Dot in a room vs having to use (2) Gen 2 in a large living area.  The sound quality isn't quite up to where the Echo itself is, but it is very close.  Music on the Gen 2 Echo Dot was distorted sounding and very tinny - this is not the case with the Gen 3 Echo Dot.  Would highly recommend upgrading if you are considering it.  I exchanged a few of my Echo Dot Gen 2s in when Amazon was running the trade-in promotion - seems like they are running such deals every so often to encourage upgrading.",0
4,"A great entry level smart device!
  
",7.Apr.19,Yes,"This thing has been really cool (I have 2 of them). My only complaints are that 1.) the audio quality is different between the two units, with one being slightly more muffled as you add bass, and 2.) it seems like the longer it stays plugged in, the slower it responds when you call it, kind of like a memory leak. I got my second unit at a drastic discount when I bought the first, so I'd say they're still an excellent deal. I use Alexa daily for my alarm, sleep sounds, and weather, and a lot of music when I'm around the house. It's cool that my kids can use the Dots to call me on my cell phone when I'm away.",0
3,"cool but need user preference enablement
  
",7.Apr.19,Yes,"Ya, I can say lots of wonderful positive things about my echo device, and I am very happy to have it, but this is about IMPROVEMENT needed.1) I use it mostly for my music in a tow room apartment using AmaMusic, SiriusXM and PandoraPrem.  It bluetooths back and forth to my bluetooth speaker in the other room.  BUT IT WON'T PLAY THRU ITSELF AND THE BLUETOOTH SPEAKER AT THE SAME TIME.  That's biggie Jeff!2) Sound quality is ok, but could be better.  Frequency control would be nice; maybe it's there and just don't it yet.  Getting it to play the wake-up alarm music loud enough has been problematic.3) Like it or not Jeff, Alexa can keep the tone and inflection of her voice, but so many other patrons I want to be able to rename her.  We all know now that you're stupid when it comes to women, so just accommodate us for this.",0
1,"Device sound quality horrible after 3 months of use!
  
",7.Apr.19,Yes,"The sound quality of my device totally crashed after just 3.5 months of use (right after the 3 month warranty expired)! Everything has static in the background and all voices (Alexa and voices on podcasts) sound like they have a horrible lisp! I contacted Amazon customer service and their only advice was to buy a new device with a 15% discount. If the quality of this device is so poor that it only lasts 3 months, then clearly it is not worth re-purchasing. I'm extremely disappointed in the quality of this Amazon device and cannot recommend it.",1
5,"Love this little thing!
  
",7.Apr.19,Yes,"This is so useful.  I can ask Alexa anything and she usually knows the answer.  I can set 3 different timers when I'm cooking and she'll tell me what each one is for when it goes off.  It's much easier to ask a question than to pull out my phone.  I loved this so much that I bought another one for the bathroom so I don't have to have a radio in there.  I just say ""Alexa, play station xyz.""  And I loved the price.  Can't beat it.",0
1,"Very dissatisfied n
  
",8.Apr.19,Yes,"This is my fifth echo Dot. The other four are second generations. the only reason I bought this one was because it was touted to have sound much superior to the 2nd generation. Well, to me, it sounds like someone talking through a rag!second generation sound is not that good but not horrible. However I would definitely give the third generation sound a horrible rating! I'm very disappointed!",2
2,"Looks pretty. Microphone sucks. Stay with 2nd Gen.
  
",8.Apr.19,Yes,"3rd gen looks pretty (the reason for the 2 stars rating), but just like others wrote - the near field and far field microphones suck big time. I literally just asked ""Alexa, play Christian Music on Pandora"", and the feedback i got was ""Playing Christian Comedians on Pandora"". ""Alexa, Stop!"". Then i repeated the request 3 more times, just to have the exact same result - definition of insanity, right? LOL. Comedy in itself is fine, but that's nowhere near the ""Music"" that i requested. My 2nd Gen array of echo dots work and respond far better. I advise everyone to stay with the older gen - they're cheaper, too (buy used, it's perfectly fine, too... I did for my last ones, and they're performing admirably)",0
4,"Gotta get the hang of these things!
  
",8.Apr.19,Yes,"Whoa!! Took me a while to get these things sorted out. Purchased 4 of them. Unfortunately I have 2 of them named the same thing as far away from each other as possible, so one doesn't activate the other because of proximity. This feature I don't like. Amazon.... common, get with the program. Due to the community Q&amp;A I have been able to find most of my questions answered, so thanks guys! Multiple rooms having the same audio, that was a tricky one! Overall the quality, sound and price for this is TOTALLY worth it.Oh and I can drop in when my kids are fighting without getting my lazy butt outta bed. _____",0
5,"Much better audio than the 2nd gen
  
",8.Apr.19,Yes,"I now have 2 of these Echo Gen 3's and a Gen 1 and Gen 2 Echo Show and while on the Show the big improvement is the much large screen, for the Dot's between 2 and 3, the sound quality is the most remarkable difference.  I've ready some gripes about the power plug being different but all-in-all, these Gen 3 Dot's are a great deal for the cost and improvement over Gen 2 in sound quality and clarity makes the upgrade worthwhile....plus, I traded-in my Gen 2 Dot to Amazon to get a good discount on the Show Gen 2. :)",0
2,"Hasn't been as good as Gen2 for me
  
",9.Apr.19,Yes,"UPDATE: Things are getting even worse. It really has poor microphones. I have this in the bedroom and I have to raise my voice (even though room is silent) to get it to hear me. Wakes up my wife. My older echos work much better.I have a voice that doesn't carry very far so I was excited to replace my gen2 Dot with this one... which promised better microphones to pick up voices even when there's background noise. I have not seen any improvement. I would say it is actually worse for me. Biggest pro is the whisper functionality - when it works. For example: I whispered something to try and be quiet for someone that was sleeping... Alexa whispered back the answer then asked in a normal loud tone something like ""Did I answer your question?"". Defeats the purpose of the whisper. Overall, I like Echo Dot. I just haven't had a good experience with the gen3 version. Don't know if it's an anomaly for me or if others are experiencing same thing.",0
2,"Google Home is better
  
",9.Apr.19,Yes,"Alexa is an incredibly stupid AI to the point where it's frustrating.  She has trouble hearing programmed routines or will answer your question with the wrong answer. The worst and most frequent answer though is ""I don't know how to answer that"".The final straw was when I set an alarm and it went off so I said ""Alexa, snooze for 20 minutes"". The alarm then started going off every 6 seconds and I couldn't stop it.  It would beep once, pause for 6 seconds, beep again and repeat. I was yelling ""Alexa stop"" and she would just give me answers like ""Which alarm do you want to stop?BEEP"". I eventually got fed up and pressed the button to try and set her up again, had the yellow ring and everything but the alarm was STILL going off.  Just going to unplug her for nowMy Google home works way better than this thing",0

The best news I have received is that there are some devices having this problem and their techs are working on the issue. Well it_ been 4 months and their techs haven_ figured it out? Most likely they aren_ going to be fixed and I_ hung out to dry. I_ shocked that amazon has not attempted to replace a defective item.

1,"Bluetooth + Speaker = Terrible experience
  
",10.Apr.19,Yes,"I've gone through 3 Echo Dots all with the same issue.  When using this device with either of the two different bluetooth speakers that I own it will only play music for any between 5 seconds to 10 minutes before the Echo Dot will lose it's internet connectivity.  If you call technical support they will make you go through the same setup guide that you find in the manual.  After a 30 minute process they will offer a replacement, so that in a week or so you can go through the return process all over again.The issue is that the Echo Dot 3 is not stable and can not run a bluetooth connection without giving you the red ring of failure. If you don't plan on using it for bluetooth, you might find it good enough.  Otherwise look elsewhere.",1
2,"Did not make me want to learn more about it - a neat little oddity
  
",10.Apr.19,Yes,"I already have a chat cylinder from another company.  Quite honestly, I forget a lot about what it was like to setup, other than I did not particularly care for it.  The other product that I have had a seamless, intuitive, and easy setup.  The Echo Dot was so boring, and seemed focused around Amazon, that it annoyed me.  It gave the appearance of listening all the time, cataloging what was heard in the in house - just my perception, not saying it's a fact.  Alexa offered to make phone calls, so I told it call someone, and said that they have to be on Amazon, or something like that, to work - what a flop.  I'm going to buy another outlet controller so that I can turn Echo-Dot/Alexa on and off through my other product. Also, the Echo Dot would not pair with my Bose Bluetooth audio adapter  - until the Echo/Dot, I haven't found a device that didn't pair with the Bose Bluetooth adapter.  The quality of the Echo Dot audio is nothing spectacular.  It's a neat little oddity that I cannot take very seriously.",0

",10.Apr.19,Yes,"I have had both Echo Dot (3rd Gen) and Echo Dot (2nd Gen) for awhile now, Both do the job for basic voice control and things of that nature. The 3rd Gen Echo does have more base overall, but for my needs the extra base does not really add much to the experience. If your buying your first (or adding one to a different room) Echo Dot then I can recommend getting the 3rd Gen, But if your just wanting to upgrade a 2nd Gen for a 3rd Gen I would suggest either not doing it (unless you listen to a lot of music), or plugging in your 2nd Gen Dot to a set of speakers.",0

",10.Apr.19,Yes,I like that you can say _lexa _lmost anywhere in the house and she will respond to you.

I do not have any complaints so far All I have is good news to report. Sound quality goes beyond anything anyone would ever expect.

5,"Dots work great even without an Amazon Echo
  
",10.Apr.19,Yes,"You do not need to have an original Alexa to make these dots work! I had misunderstood that and that's what kept me from getting one sooner. I ended up purchasing 2 of these Echo dots and we have been using them since Valentine's Day. I have five children that have had a lot of fun having Alexa tell stories and jokes.One thing that I really like is the ability for me to drop in on the downstairs Echo dot using the upstairs Echo dot to relay messages to the kids that ""can't hear me"".Since I have Prime and lots of Prime music for free, I use it for music often.Another feature that I had no idea about but use everyday is the ability to stream any radio stations using TuneIn.I can stream those all day long, to my location in Utah from their location in Pennsylvania, and the sound quality is great!",0

",11.Apr.19,Yes,"I_ an Apple guy. I used to work for Apple Retail and have used the HomePod and Apple Music extensively. I got the Echo Dot for free with the purchase of a Ring Doorbell.Alexa is doing great! She picks up what I_ saying quickly and responds aptly. I haven_ even called her bad names yet, as Siri has taken a tongue lashing from me. In the same breath, she responds more quickly and more thoroughly because she is remembering all my conversations, and as we have recently learned, these conversations are being sent out to be listened to. Siri does not remember prior conversations for privacy reasons, which is a higher moral standard, but less effective in the short term.But that_ okay, because you can turn off the settings that allows Alexa to send your audio out to be listened to.Amazon Music is okay, but the library is nowhere near as large as Apple Music and couldn_ play some of my favorite albums.But that_ okay, as I was able to easily set up my Apple Music account through the Alexa app and now I just tell Alexa to tell Siri to play my Apple Music. Alexa has an assistant, and her name is Siri.The bass is almost nonexistent in this little Dot, with a lot of low-mid trying to cover it, which is does an alright job of. The mids and highs are nice.But that_ okay, because it has a headphone jack and I just plugged it into my existing stereo.I haven_ tried any of the higher functions yet, but right out of the box and the first week have been impressive.Things are best when they are free.",0

So it works perfect for my, but not so great for other people visiting our home.Also audio quality is amazing for such small device. Even my dogs now are enjoying music when I leave the house.",0
5,"It's all fun and games until the power cord comes loose
  
",12.Apr.19,Yes,"Okay I'm really hoping that Amazon customer service will read this review because I actually sent back my first Echo 3rd gen that I bought because when I played music occasionally it would just get very distorted and start sounding like one of the speakers was blown basically. If anybody's ever had a blown speaker you know what that sounds like and it sounds horrible. Well we sent back the device and received a replacement only to have the replacement a few days later start doing the exact same thing. Now my logical brain deduced quickly that the two devices could not both be damaged because that was too much of a coincidence. So after tinkering with it for a while my wife and I figured out that if the power cord on the 3rd gen Echo becomes a little loose it starts distorting the speaker sound very badly. So hopefully that's an issue you guys are already aware of if not maybe I can bring it to your attention right now, but that is definitely an issue that happens. so ever since we have mounted are device on the ceiling and the cord is securely connected to the mounts and will not become loose anymore we have not had this issue, but this could be a serious problem for all the customers who are buying these devices and then just thinking that they're crap and sending them back now I love you guys Amazon so I knew that was not the case so I had to figure that out but I just wanted to let anyone else know that this is an amazing product I love it very much but if you start having that distortion of the sound problem like I was check your power cord and make sure it is securely plugged in.",0

",12.Apr.19,Yes,Being brand new (just received) I am having a good time with the ease of playing my radio stations and asking questions to help with crosswords and such. I'll probably get over the novelty but it works very well and I think it plays loud enough for me. Initially being an older adult I had a little uneasiness with the app and probably still don't understand all I can do with Alexa.  Tech people think everyone is tech literate but my spouse would have no idea how to set it up. Could be a little more plan and simplified. I realize it's more for the young but a few moments of simplification would be appreciated. Older people are more afraid to accidentally punch the wrong thing. Of course the system would like accidental purchases.,0
5,"Alexa has become our newest family member
  
",12.Apr.19,Yes,"Works very well, fun to use along with attempts to fool alexa (Who is your daddy).Alexa requires a constant internet connection...although you can ask alexa 'are you connected to the internet'.Overall an amazing product which handles different voices very well. Music is good for her size.Fun facts + ability to perform calculations are bonus.Alexa has integrated flawlessly with smart home products (WeMo + Moes).Only downside, since Alexa is 'always' listening, when talking about Alexa in the 3rd person she will respond.We refer to her as 'She who cannot be named'.  ;-)",0
5,"Clean style
  
",12.Apr.19,Yes,"We have a number of connected devices from Amazon, but I wanted a smaller device that could be mounted to the plugin (we purchased a mount separately). This device not only sounds good but looks good as well. At first I was disappointed that the first generation was no longer available as the mount options are much more plentiful. However the style of this device makes it look like it is supposed to be there and the rounded edges don_ hurt if you kid bumps into it.",0
5,"Amazing product yet niche and unnecessary for most people
  
",13.Apr.19,Yes,"Awesome and fun. So many great features. I bought it for smart home use and it's been a charm. I wish it didn't need internet but I understand how it works so its fine. My biggest gripe is that their still aren't enough skills available for various interests. One that stands out is that theirs no weather skill for my area or a news skill for many areas, but I can't fault amazon for that since most of these skills seem to be independently developed. If the internet is too slow it sometimes hiccups and might take awhile to speak back or if a song is playing through it might lower the quality but those are to be expected. My second gripe is that the bass is sounds a little off but all in all it's a great product that works great for its main purposes, if you want better audio just buy the version that hooks up to your stereo system.",1

",13.Apr.19,Yes,"All of a sudden with same environment (same WiFi network, same Echo Dot location, same quiet room, etc.)Echo Dot keeps saying ""I am having trouble understanding, try again later."" for three days.I have a lengthy conversation with customer service team letting me know that my Echo Dot is out of warranty so they can't be replaced. A suggestion he offered was move Echo Dot close to WiFi router...What a simple waste of my time talking to someone with a lack of technical knowledge....I did hard reset, reboot, and moved it close to WiFi router. Nothing works...Toss it to the garbage reminding myself never buy any Alexa products again.",3
4,"Good Starter Device
  
",13.Apr.19,Yes,I love the convenience for playing my favorite music from Amazon music or Spotify.  Love the ability to quickly learn the weather and latest news.  Love the Alexa features.  However the Alexa app can be a bit clunky compared to a typical Apple designed interface.  I bought the dot as a trail to see if I like the concept for my home.  Okay sound but nothing to get excited about.  Will upgrade to the larger and better Alexa speakers in the future.,0
1,"Poor sound quality versus previous generation.
  
",13.Apr.19,Yes,"Produces a very poor sound quality. Although the speaker is louder than the first generation the sound quality is not good.  Listening to a podcast or talk radio, voices give off a rattling, tinny, and distorted sound. This even happens just using Alexa. I would not recommend. I have four of these second generation speakers that replaced the first generation. I wished I would_e kept all of the older versions.  These Gen 2 echo dots are just placed in areas of convenience but are very annoying to listen to.",1
1,"Disappointed. Customer service run around.
  
",14.Apr.19,Yes,"Purschased the Exho for for the music playing ability. Worked flawless in the first 2 weeks then had several issues with volume and connecting to linked skills requiring me to unplug and _eset Alexa. On 3/30/19 I changed SiriusXM accounts. New account linked in skills but would no longer play on My echo. Contacted customer service who attempted to troubleshoot and was unable. I was told it would be escalated and I would receive a call in 24-hours. No call came and I have since emailed and spoke with customer service 2x/ea. Now 2-weeks later and this has started as just a glitch on my echo that it literally worked one minute but not the next, to a system wide issue with SiriusXM and no anticipation of when it will be resolved. Only information I have received now is that it has been escalated to a Master ticket and it is being worked on.",3
5,"so far so good!
  
",14.Apr.19,Yes,"I wasn't sure what to expect with Alexa. i do wish they had a booklet that went with it to explain everything Alexa can do! that has been frustrating to learn how to use it. you have to say Alexa first &amp; then your command. i enjoy being able to make a phone call easily, ask about the weather, listen to my music &amp; have her start my day! very fun!! i have had no problems with the device at this point. i have tried a variety of things just to see what happens. you do get a weekly email of updates on what she has been programed to do. connectivity to my amazon stuff has been smooth with the music &amp; audible books. no problems accessing my phone contacts. i put the app on my phone. i don't have blue tooth to connect. i did get the free plug &amp; am assuming i can plug in a light &amp; have her turn it on or off! fun!! i haven't figured out where i want to do that yet. i also saw on amazon you can order a door with a lock that alexa can lock or unlock with voice command. next will be a fully functioning smart house like on the TV show Eureka!!",0

",14.Apr.19,Yes,"I bought this item back in November and when I first got it, i was able to set it up with 0 zero issues. Fast forward to February the device stopped working and after trying every trouble shooting advice possible, the item is still not working and it doesn_ make sense to call Amazon. They just have you try the same trouble shooting you_e already done which does not help. I wish I could return this item but unfortunately I am outside of my return window..",2

",14.Apr.19,Yes,"Such a powerful speaker for the money and with Alexa being its primary function I, and my wife love it we can drop in to rooms when we don_ have our phones and it works like a intercom I love it! I know the weather everyday and I like when I_ leaving for work asking for the weather to know if o need to carry my umbrella! Works awesome no issues just need more of them!",1
5,"Easy to use and great features!
  
",14.Apr.19,Yes,"Honestly this is pretty damn awesome! I love how it looks and the performance is amazing. I have a Google mini but I prefer to use this one. Setting up and linking my apps and devices was a piece of cake, anyone can do it. I personally prefer Alexa to be on high volume but you can change it however you want. My daughter loves it, she listens to music on it all the time. This makes life a little easier for us and we love it.",1
1,"Don't buy if you want them to work independantly
  
",14.Apr.19,Yes,"I bought two of these things for my kids for Christmas so that they can hear different nature sounds at night while they sleep.  These things keep trying to sync with each other, and when they do one child hears the other one's request, and the one that request certain sounds get nothing.  Trying to unsync them is a big pain, and is difficult to find any information from Amazon.  When they don't sync, they work great, but when they sync they are a piece of junk.",2
5,"Hey Si...Alexa
  
",14.Apr.19,Yes,"As an Apple person who won_ purchase their HomePod because of the ridiculous price, I decided to purchase these instead. I bought one for each room and mainly use the bedroom one. Honestly I really only use it for news briefing and sleep sounds but the capability of this product is pretty vast.",1
2,"3rd gen and still NO Optical Out?
  
",15.Apr.19,Yes,"Amazon needs to add an optical out on these already. The Chromecast Audio puck has had optical out for ages but I prefer the Alexa environment over Google Home. The built in DAC/3.5mm output on the Dot sounds horrible. I would love to be able to run this through the Schiit Yggdrasil for casual Spotify listening when I don't feel like booting up Foobar but no optical out takes that off the table.Come on, Amazon! You're missing an entire market of high-end audio users who would buy these if we could bypass the lousy internal DAC and use our own.",1
3,"Software is difficult to use- Sonos support is difficult
  
",15.Apr.19,Yes,I have a Sonos system in my house driven by a Sonos Player and my own speakers throughout my house. I recently added a stand alone Sonos paired speakers in my bedroom to the overall system. Those speakers use the Amazon Alexa commands.The bedroom speakers worked so well with the Sonos and Amazon Alexa voice commands that I though I would try voice in the living room where I listen to music much of the time so I added the echo dot. It took a long time to set up a grouping of my rooms to use the echo dot and I am quite technology oriented. The software and the documentation is not helpful. I finally got it to work the way I wanted to by creating speaker groups that the dot now recognizes. Software was not easy to use but it now works well,0
2,"Total failure two weeks out of warranty after one hour of total useage
  
",15.Apr.19,Yes,"I purchased this Echo Dot Gen 3 for my wife as a Christmas gift.  We registered it, and then packed it away before getting any use out of it because we were in the process of moving out of state.  I was really impressed with the sound quality.  It was unpacked an connected when we moved into our new house worked really great for an hour before the unit died, exactly two weeks after the expiration of the 90 day warranty.  Amazon replaced the power supply free of charge, however that did not solve the problem. The unit simply no longer powers up.I'm certain that Amazon knows exactly how long this unit was powered up (since they're listening.)  I'm just disappointed that the best they could do was offer me a 15% discount on the purchase of a new unit.  We took a pass on replacing it.  Amazon knows too much about us already :)",0
1,"Does not respond well after two months and the CSR is sucks!!
  
",15.Apr.19,Yes,"After two month use, there was one time it did not respond me while playing music as my mouth only inches away, and another time when I called ""Alexa"" it does not respond at all but my second one placed farther responded. Contacted CSR for a replacement, the CSR asked to go through their troubleshooting process and told it was because the volume was low. That's interesting to hear that in my life the device volume is about if the device can hear me not the sound the device plays. And the CSR asked me to send back the product but they may send the same one back if they think there's no problem. I'd very like to know they would explain the closer one did not respond but the farther one did. Very disappointed",1
4,"Great choice
  
",16.Apr.19,Yes,"Initially I had a tough time getting connected to Wi-Fi, as I didn't have enough instruction to know I need my secure password for connection. However, after getting everything working properly, I am happy with this purchase. It will give me peace of mind to have this, as my husband is disabled, &amp; when I'm gone might need to call 911 plus me in an emergency situation. This is my primary reason for selecting this unit along with the Echo Connect device. We will discover much more when time &amp; curiosity permits.",0
4,"You can ask for information about EVERYTHING
  
",16.Apr.19,Yes,"The tasks, reminders, alarms, and communication features are awesome. Set up is easy, but you do need a phone or other device to set it up. After that, it's voice-activated. You can ask for information about EVERYTHING - movies, the weather, history, solve math problems - it's all there for free. after the Echo answers your question or completes a task, and I say ""thank-you"" - It replies to you with, ""your welcome"", ""you bet"" or 'anytime'!",0

",16.Apr.19,Yes,"I have two older Dots as well as two of the newer dots and Amazon has made this little machine even better than it was. I also have an older full-size Echo and the sound from these 3rd generation dots is close to what the Echo is. I imagine the new full-size Echo is even better. How can you go wrong with a device that can understand most things you ask it to do, sounds great playing music, and costs less than $50?",0
3,"MEH
  
",17.Apr.19,Yes,"My rating is not the brilliance of the DOT, but the services connected to the Dot  Audio fidelity, and the Echo are MEH,  Even with the new equalizer software treble is sacrificed at the expense of bass.  I have resorted to plugging the Dot into a stereo system for more controlled fidelity. I like to get my news flash several times a day.  The audio volume  of THE SERVICES is terrible.  The volume between services varies widely,  If Amazon is (arbitrarily) 'volume 5', NPR is volume 3 and  Bloomberg News is 'volume 10'.  I have mentioned this  to Amazon Customer Service and nothing has been done for over a year.Also, if you plug any device into the 3.5mm jack it cuts of the Bluetooth connection!.  I think that is just plain silly.On a positive, the Wall clock is a great feature, and remote control of appliances is a great feature",0
5,"Great voice assistant &amp; AI
  
",17.Apr.19,Yes,"As a long-time iPhone and Siri user, I_ super impressed with Alexa_ fast reaction and accuracy. It really puts Siri to shame. Alexa correctly understands my commands over 99% of the time and immediately performs them. I use it to tune into SiriusXM channels and my local NPR station, play music through Apple Music, listen to news headlines, get the weather, and connect to my phone for a Bluetooth speaker when I want better audio than my phone_ speakers. I also use it to turn off my tv (it_ sadly too old to turn on with Alexa, but off will do). Alexa_ technology and _kills (aka apps) really seem to work seamlessly. It makes me want to upgrade my existing home gadgets, which mostly lack smart home features, sooner so I can fully avail myself of Alexa_ smart home capabilities. My usage is still fairly basic. I don_ use Alexa to make calls, or read or send messages/emails because I think some of those functions are limited to contacts who have Alexa devices, and others just seem like major security/privacy breaches waiting to happen. I also don_ use Alexa to do Amazon orders because I want to be able to price shop and know exactly what I_ getting before the order goes through. But overall, I_ impressed with its technology and capabilities. Shocking that Amazon beat Apple here so roundly.",0
5,"Nice addition to the family!
  
",17.Apr.19,Yes,"First off, when my kids asked if I was concerned that people at Amazon were listening, I told them I had no plans to break the law anytime soon, so, no. I replaced my thermostat and wanted to get one that worked with the Echo. I also suddenly had an excuse to add a couple of Smart Plugs to let Alexa turn lamps off in the family and bedrooms. Those lamps required you to awkwardly reach up under the shade to switch them off. Now we just ask our buddy, Alexa, to turn them on/off for us. I have been enjoying the Amazon Music Unlimited too. I love paying $3 to hear whatever music I am feeling at the moment, vs using my tv and wearing it out. Echo Dot 3 has a sound as full as or better than my Blue-tooth LE-Bose Surround speaker.",0

",17.Apr.19,Yes,"Sounds great for the priceUpdate- This broke after a month of moderate use. I was able to get a replacement. The replacement is a refurbished one that did not come with a power cord. Since I sent my power cord back with the device I now needed to order a new power cord that magically wont be here for 5 days with my 2 day prime. The device itself is ok, but the customer support is lacking a bit. My advice is not to send your power cord back if yours fails like mine did.",0

",18.Apr.19,Yes,"I'm embarrassed. I teased a friend who has an Alexa in several of the rooms in his house. For months I said, ""I'd never have one, why?"" Well, I take that back. This is similar to the first time I bought an electric screwdriver. I recall saying to myself ""how did I live without it?"" So, this little item is simply amazing. I'm able to enjoy my audible selections while cleaning the kitchen, easily listen to radio stations of interest thousands of miles away, add items to shopping and to do lists, turn off upstairs lights and catch up on traffic and news. I love it. I'll be purchasing more units. I will say in all honesty, I have the google version as well, but the Amazon Alexa item in my view, is superior. Thanks Amazon.",0
5,"Kind of life changing
  
",18.Apr.19,Yes,Really warmed up to the idea of having one of these things. It's kind of like having a smartphone in that you don't realize how handy it is to have around until you do. Voice commands work really well. It's amazing how you can think up so many different questions or commands and it automatically understands. Love streaming music through the house. Setting timers verbally while I'm in the kitchen and my hands have food on them. Great for reminders. Parents can also montior the sound in the house from a remote location through the smart phones app. Great if you have kids. Also helps my kids with their homework when I'm not around. It's the side of a hockey puck.,0
5,"Functions as expected.
  
",18.Apr.19,Yes,"First. I am not a big fan of these machines. This one came with  a subcription to satellite radio. It took a short time to get an ""app"" and set it up to use my wifi. I use it to access the satellite programming via internet ""streaming"". It does that job well and I am satisfied with that. Any of it's other functions I don't use and expect not use. My wife has one of these and uses it for streaming music and she gets the local news and weather through it too.It arrived in good order and well protected as usual. I would recommend one to customers who are interested in such things but cannot speak to the other functions like controlling a ""smart house"".Bill",0
5,"Easy to Setup
  
",18.Apr.19,Yes,"The Echo Dot has made my home truly tech friendly, from turning on/off light, controlling the thermostat, easy integration into my stereo system to play my favorite music. It's amazing that life existed before technology however, it has made our lives easier - sometimes not in a good way, just my two cents.  I have mine sitting behind a picture on a side table so it's barely noticeable.  If you wary about setup, it's super simple and you don't need to be a techo geek to do it.",0

",18.Apr.19,Yes,"I have been delinquent in writing this review - I now have three echo products and I think they are excellent. I purchased this DOT for my bedroom and she (I guess it could be a he) interacts wells with the other echo's in the house.  I was a bit hesitant that the sound quality would be sub-par but have been pleasantly surprised. Even the bass response is great, especially for such a small footprint. What can I say, just order it.

1,"Echo Dot 3rd gen fails hard!
  
",18.Apr.19,Yes,"My family had an echo dot 3rd gen for several weeks.  We had upgraded from an echo dot 2nd gen and were happy with the sound and how the 3rd gen functioned..  Today Alexa set off an alarm and would not stop.  No matter what we said to have Alexa to stop the alarm, Alexa would not stop and Alexa said there were no active alarms.  I decided to smash Alex.  We all talked about it.  When a computer stops taking instructions and malfunctions like this, there is not a second chance.  I will try google now with the same expectations. Space Odyssey 2001 is not an option.  F*&amp;^ technology that is designed to take instructions and fails.  Now I also have to cancel my Amazon music!  Oh well.",1

",18.Apr.19,Yes,"Purchased primarily for music in living room and kitchen. Good sound quality, but performance is sketchy and capabilities are limited. Paired stereo (two echo dots in living room) works, but frequently one speaker or the other _gnores the first 5-10 seconds of a song then starts mid-phrase and plays properly until the next song whereupon the same symptoms repeat. Only fix seems to be unplugging both dots and restarting them. We_e also very disappointed that there is no way to play music from our own library.",0

",18.Apr.19,Yes,"Fun to have around, but mainly wanted it to control my TV. Only thing it's good for, is telling PSVue to start, and go to a channel. It wont turn my TV on or off.

",19.Apr.19,Yes,"I have two 3rd generation Echo Dots. I bought them right before Christmas as gifts for my husband.  At first they were both great! We still do enjoy them, especially for the music, but the speakers in both are junk.  If I listen to music for more than 15-20 minutes, then sound and Alexa become distorted and static like. If I turn them off for a couple hours the sound returns to normal, but only for a short while. I have posted a video with this review as an example of what you will get if you purchase an Echo Dot 3rd generation. I have searched Amazon to see if I can get them replaced, but I can't get anywhere. I hit one wall after another. If it were just one of the dots I would just figure I got a bad one, but it's both! We have a regular Echo also and have had no trouble.",3
2,"CRAPPY TECHNOLOGY FOR THIS DAY AND AGE
  
",19.Apr.19,Yes,Update. with the way technology is today you would think the Alexa app would be much smarter in understanding the English language. Awful. And beware it will purchase things or put you on a monthly payment of some sort of service quite easily and without you knowing if you say the wrong thing. So keep an eye on your bank statement. Simple statements such as Alexa go to chapter 1. Just like that and all she says is I'm sorry I don't know that. very very simple commands she doesn't get it when reading a book. The device is nice but the Alexa service sucks pretty muchI bought this to listen to books from my Kindle library but I did not know it was not wireless. However it still works great. And it is so much fun to have. Read stories at night. Plays games. Plays any song I want from the Amazon music.... all voice controls. Absolutely love it. If this holds up it's worth every Star if it doesn't I'll come back in re-edit,0
2,"Keep looking
  
",19.Apr.19,Yes,"I upgraded to the 3rd generation Dot from the 2nd generation Dot roughly 6 months ago. My only complaint about the 2nd gen Dot is that it wasn't loud enough. This issue was resolved with the 3rd gen. Initially, I loved it. I thought the sound quality was much better than the 2nd gen. But the love affair soon faded. At first, the sound would randomly start crackling, and sound distorted, like the speaker was blown. But it wasn't consistent, it did this very sporadically. Then, I started to notice a long pause/delay with the Dots responses to my commands. Now, approximately 6 months after purchasing, the sound is consistently fuzzy and unpleasant to listen to 100% of the time. Music is a definite no-go, it's so distorted that it's unbearable. Podcasts are slightly more tolerable, but still pretty bad. I've power cycled, disconnected/reconnected, etc. Nothing has solved the problem. Based on a preliminary Google search, I'm not the only person experiencing this issue, it appears to be a common complaint. I have 2 other echo devices (original and spot) and they work fine, no issues with them. And I never had this issue with the 2nd gen Dot. This is exclusive to the 3rd gen Dot. Overall, I cannot recommend this product.",0

",19.Apr.19,Yes,"The setup with the Alexa app is very easy, although I did go and buy some Phillips Hue lights a month later, and when I set them up now Alexa won't ""turn off the lights"" downstairs because technically it isn't a light she is turning off, but rather the 'smartplug' so she tells me she doesn't have any devices listed as 'lights.'  I won't ding the plug for my stupidity or inability to set things up properly, but am slightly annoyed that I have to change something i already had setup because I added a new device to the Alexa app.",0

Would not have bought had I known this would have saved money &amp; just bought 2 echos.I_ sure I will get it figured out &amp; love it thouh!,0
3,"Disappointing. Bluetooth and multi device play back extremely limited.
  
",20.Apr.19,Yes,"Disappointing. I am a big podcast listener and had hoped that multiple series 3 would give me Bluetooth audio on all designated devices so that I could move freely through the house listening. Unfortunately, ain_ going to happen. Stereo pairing only works with two series 3 devices on streaming music services. Or hear the end of the egg timer in the bedroom instead of just the kitchen. What is Amazon thinking? This is not a heavy lift.",0
2,"Can't access apps that I use
  
",21.Apr.19,Yes,"Unfortunately the Echo Dot hasn't worked out as well as I expected. I purchased it to give me the ability to listen to sleep music and sleep apps, specifically the app 'Calm'. The Dot (or maybe it's Alexa?) doesn't have the ability to access Calm. I also expected the speaker to be at least as good, if not better, than that on my phone, but it is not.Later: I give Amazon a huge amount of credit - they saw this review and immediately got in touch with me to see what could be done to resolve the issue. There was nothing that could be done about the Calm app not being available, but the rep spent a considerable amount of time teaching me how to adjust the Dot's treble, bass, and midrange, and stepping me through other options.  We were unable to get the sound quality that I was hoping for but  I guess I shouldn't expect excellent sound from something that only costs $39!  I'm going to try hooking up some speakers to see if that solves it. I was incredibly impressed with Amazon support though!",0
5,"LOVE THIS ITEM!
  
",21.Apr.19,Yes,"I purchased the first Gen of these and have loved her, so getting another one was twice the awesome. I keep the newer one in my office and I play music. I would love to purchase one for each room of my house and I will probably will. Totally recommend it. If you didn't know, you can use them in a pair to communicate with others in the room where it is, like a two way walkie talkie. You can even listen in on your phone and talk to others through your phone or through the device. I tried buying some of those wall plugs, they are expensive, to work with Alexa, I couldn't seem to get them to work, took them back to the store, but maybe with the newer one, it might work, Ill see, maybe when the price comes down some more.",0
2,"It works like any Alexa if you can get it set up
  
",22.Apr.19,Yes,"It comes with a fold-out with six steps for setup. One of the mandatory steps is to download the Alexa app onto one of your phones. Android, iOS, and Fire are all supported.I didn't exactly want to do this, because the app then asks to read all kinds of information from your phone and send to Amazon. I don't really want it to know every person I've ever gotten a phone number from, most of whom I don't call. If I want to talk to someone through Dot -- a big IF -- I just add the number. That's like three people tops.Continuing ...One step is to connect to Dot via its WiFi network. It would then use your phone to set it up.On my Android phone, the wireless network has no internet connection, so the first couple of times it dropped. I eventually got this straightened out, but after it connects the app is supposed to allow you to set up the device instead of not respond. Once I got stuck, I'd have to start over from the top, disconnecting power to Dot and repeating the entire process.Next I tried to do it via my iMac. There is a web portal to connect to. Clicking on a few buttons, you navigate the same place as the app on Android. The UI is the same, only much bigger. At this point, as with the phone you have to connect to Dot's WiFi network.I got farther here. I choose a WiFi network for Dot to connect to. And then I click submit. The website unfailingly reports a  expired authentication or some such error. Again to retry, you'd have to unpower Dot and repower it.After giving this nearly ten tries. I gave up.Good think I have an iPad. It connected and went through on the second try. The app on the iPad crashed the first time.On paper -- literally on the leaflet -- setup takes five steps. In practice, I have to count all of the times those five steps didn't work, so sixty. If some of the steps are so big that they fail frequently, perhaps they should have split those steps into smaller more reliable ones.For comparison, I set up my WiFi AP not long ago. You've seen the configuration screens for these things. They're quite complicated. I recalled that it took fewer than 60 steps and less than 1 hour.",0
5,"Is it the CIA? I don't know, but it plays music really well
  
",22.Apr.19,Yes,"Some will say that Alexa is all apart of the CIA. Well, if it is, then oh well. My cell phone and computer hear everything that my family and I say so what is one more microphone in the house. It is great to listen to music and play games with.The sound quality is pretty good considering it is such a small speaker. Good bass, great mids, and highs. This is not audiophile level, but for every day listening it is wonderful. Alexa integration is great. I can just talk and it listens to me, better than my children. My only gripe is that multi-room listening doesn't work with my Echo Tap. This is a whatever thing and not a deal breaker. Oh well, all I need to do is ask Alexa to move the music where I want it.All in all, my CIA voice recorder is amazing. I would totally buy more. Nothing like sharing my information with the government.",0
1,"Doesn't work with all TV's.
  
",22.Apr.19,Yes,"I can't use the product. It was a birthday present for my husband from our daughter. She has one for every tv in her house and has older (up to 10 years old) tv's and the product works fine with them. Our tv is a 4K smart tv that's only 3 months old and it won't work with it. We called customer service to see if they could help and they told her that I needed to buy a more expensive tv.  So, she deleted the app off of my iphone.",1
1,"HORRIBLE PRODUCT
  
",22.Apr.19,Yes,Had to return all 3 of these that were purchased as a Christmas gift.  None could be connected successfully after spending hours upon hours of reading and following Youtube instructions.  Other friends have had the same connectivity issues.  The older versions are better if you want this type of product.,1
3,"Great sound, keep it away from the kitchen.
  
",23.Apr.19,Yes,"Update: Really Amazon? Was it *completely* necessary to make the plug so huge you can_ plug in anything else? Just like Apple, you guys are turning into a bunch of money grubbing jerks who make everything so specific that it cant be used with anything else, and you have to buy even more stuff to make it compatible to even make the attempt. (see photo of 3 outlet adapter)The appearance and sound are better than expected. But the reason I gave only 3 stars is: if you are going to use this device in a kitchen or even near one, WHYYYYYY would Amazon choose to make it from a textile material that you can_ clean? This unit WAS destined for the kitchen area, but now I have to do some shuffling to put it away from where moisture and grease will make it all gross.Also, the non-slip (silicone?) material on the bottom REEKS. The smell will hopefully fade, but it currently stinks like mold and rubber, and it_ been out of the packaging for over an hour.Also, Amazon has gone the way of money-grubbing Apple, in making the power cable unit-specific. I took note because of a cable-chewing kitten we have, and with the gen-2s, you can replace the micro cable. This one is one cable, from unit to outlet. I haven_ checked the price of a replacement yet, but I_ certain it is more expensive than a 3 pack of amazon basic 6 micro cables.",1
1,"Didn't last 5 months
  
",23.Apr.19,Yes,"I have a full sized Echo and am satisfied with it's performance. So I thought the Dot would be a nice addition for another room.The pros:1. The device is attractive and blends into the rooms decor without being an eyesore.2. For it's size the sound quality was good.The cons:1. Sometimes it would respond to the wake up word, but would ignore the command/question and go back to ""sleep.""2. Sometimes there were pauses during songs or flash briefings.3. After less than 5 months the device stopped working. I would give the wake up word and a red ring would appear instead of the blue one and Alexa would respond ""I'm sorry I'm having trouble understanding right now. Please try again later.""4. Customer service was polite, but after going through all of the steps with them they determined the Echo Dot would have to be replaced. The warranty was only 90 days, but they would grant a 15% discount.The bottom line for me is simple. If the product won't even last 5 months, I wouldn't throw good money after bad for another one. The device was never dropped, abused, or had anything spilled on it. I've had batteries last longer. Lol",1
5,"Just wish this had been the 1st generation
  
",23.Apr.19,Yes,"The sound on this little thing is 10 times better than all of the past generations.  Looks good and works well.  Has the headphone out jack if you want this thing to play from your good stereo system, but where this shines is in places that you don't typically have a stereo such as the bedroom/guest bedroom or kitchen.  Compared to the past Dots ( of which I have several), these are not tinny at all and have a much better range and can easily be understood without straining to hear.  Better understandability for lack of a better word.  My only regret is that I can't just replace all of my older models with these.",0
2,"Echo Dot uses too much hard sell during the set-up
  
",23.Apr.19,Yes,"I had a hard time setting the Echo Dot up without buying Audible or other subscription services. I had to choose ""no"" many times to avoid signing up for Audible and I have to check my credit card bill to ensure they didn't sign me up anyways. And the verbal purchase option, I specifically set it up to not have this service yet I received an email that it was activated. I dislike subscriptions, and really dislike the hard-sell. If I hadn't gotten the Echo Dot as a premium from another purchase now that I see how the hard-sell/up-sell is part of it, I wouldn't buy this item.",0
5,"Echo Dots Rock
  
",23.Apr.19,Yes,"I have purchased this twice as gifts and recently purchased one for my bedroom. I have have also purchased two other more expensive echos, one of which stopped working to my dismay after not having been used hardly at all. My gift recipients have been very happy with their gifts and I have enjoyed having the dot by my bedside if I am in mood for music or in need of a wake up call. For the price, you can't go wrong.",0
5,"Super slick! Better than the previous versions.
  
",24.Apr.19,Yes,"You know it's bad when you go to work or some place public and you have to fight the urge to say ""Alexa! Blah blah blah!""Seriously the best thing since Apple Pie. I have an Echo Show, Fire Stick, a bunch of previous generation dots, smart plugs, and the echo with the speaker but recently ponied up for a few of the newer generation dots.I have to say, these are super slick - not as clunky as the previous generations. I really enjoy looking at them and I love that there are more colors than black.I think Amazon should include like an outlet mount (for an additional cost) so that I didn't have to buy it from a third party vendor but outside of this, I'm pleased with this generation of Echo Dot.As time goes on, it seems like the Dot continues to pay for itself by being able to control and/or work additional devices released. This is an added benefit of having the Dots.",0
5,"So much better then the other generations, used as speaker for pc
  
",24.Apr.19,Yes,"I have had Alexa products since they first came out, and with my new pc (no speakers set up) I decided to get one of the 3rd gen in order to use it as a bluetooth speaker for my gaming pc.Works great. BUT... If you are planning on playing a game like rocket league that is fast paced then it wont work very well for you as it still has a hard time keeping up, not by alot but noticeable for me. Is that a deal breaker? first off I use it for most other games and it works awesome, when i play competitive high paced games I just use my headphones.Sound is much improved and responsiveness is better then my gen 1 large tubular Alexa. Overall for the price you cant go wrong.",0
2,"Falsely advertised as working with Spotify, Group play constantly stops
  
",24.Apr.19,Yes,"They advertise as working with Spotify, but THEY DON'T.  I called tech support and they said it's a known issue.  They constantly skip, pause, or show the wrong song.  I'll have to switch over to their (Amazon's) music service and spend dozens of hours recreating the playlist in Amazon (I have over 1,000 songs).  Also, their music platform is not user friendly like Spotify.  You can't sort alphabetically so I can't figure out if a song is in there multiple times.  I'm very let down.Update 8/21/19: After streaming 8 hours a day at my business, things have been going somewhat okay so I increased the rating to 2 stars.  Major problem now: streaming CONSTANTLY gets disrupted (stops mid song so you have to restart the stream).  Lots of people have this problem apparently and Amazon tech support doesn't know how to fix it.  Replacing the dots or resetting them doesn't work.",0
5,"These are great!
  
",24.Apr.19,Yes,"I love the Dot!  Its small, stays out of the way, and is the handiest thing I've bought in years.  She makes my shopping lists, my to-do lists, tells me the time, the weather, tells jokes.I really can't see any difference between the Dot and the Echo, except for size and price.  I'm told the difference is the speakers -- but really, I can't tell any difference in the sound quality.I will eventually have a Dot in every room.",0
3,"Difficult to set up a second time
  
",24.Apr.19,Yes,"I bought this several months ago, and while it is easy to speak to a device to request a timer or songs be played, the device is intrusive.  More recently I changed routers and needed to change the information in the settings for the echo dot.  After trying several times, and having a family member also try, I figured it was not worth the bother to have the echo dot work.  I will probably put it in my next garage sale.",0
2,"Shockinlgy bad sound quality, lousy warranty
  
",25.Apr.19,Yes,"I've been experiencing the same problem I see many others have had with this 3rd gen device. Intermittent crackling, fuzzy feedback. I've tried moving it away from any possible wifi interference, placing it on different surfaces and resetting the equalizer.  But whether it's minutes or an hour after a reset, the poor feedback returns as if  the entire  device was in a brown paper bag. I was shocked to learn that this supposed flagship product of Amazon has only a 3 month warranty.  My product displayed these faults well within the three month warranty, but I unfortunately waited about two weeks too late to seek a replacement, and Amazon refused to make an exception.  Very disapointing product here, and even worse customer service.",1

",26.Apr.19,Yes,Bought 3 echo dots to play music simultaneously. Disappointed to find out I don_ have the right kind of Amazon Music account to play the same song on all three devices. Not very easy to find out this information based on the sales pitch for the device. I understand upselling you music service for access to more songs but why restrict the ability to play them on your own device. Shame on Amazon for making this feature a premium one. I pay for Prime membership for the benefits but I can_ play my prime music on more than one Echo at a time??,2

I turned the entire WIFI and router and Echo Dot of and on to no avail.I am thinking of sending it back, I don't want to see a green ring light up when I talk and do nothing.",1
5,"Excellent Device, A few tweaks could make it great though.
  
",27.Apr.19,Yes,"I love these smart home devices. They make listening to music so easy and fun compared to the days of using CD's.I have a number of devices in my home from lights to cameras that I love to control with Alexa as well. I spent a couple of years using google home because at the time the google home mini had a much better speaker. I connect to stereos in some rooms, but others, like a bathroom it is nice to listen in the shower without having a larger expensive device taking up space. I have now had Alexa for a while and am happy I made the switch from google, but there are some things that may keep techie people from making that switch. I quickly realized (since I use these devices for more than the most basic stuff) that there are a lot of areas that seem to get ignored or maybe it just takes a couple years to figure out...Pros:- Allowing devices to trigger routines is in the works and is awesome! Need more device support for switches and motion sensors!-Alexa is so easy to say! I would much rather be able to name my assistant, but this was well thought out compared to ""okay google"" (saying that command got old fast)-The Alexa app is pretty good, it is easy enough to figure out.-I can control my smart lights well.-I found a great 3rd party app for integrating my shopping lists and notes (anylist). The shopping list feature was terrible on google.-I love listening to music by voice and making playlists.-Echo Devices connect perfectly to stereo equipment with AV to Aux cords making a huge sound upgrade.-The price is great for all it can do.-Routines are so useful, unfortunately this feature is mostly a Con for me.-The speaker sounds pretty good, not quite as good as google mini (maybe debatable) but not far enough behind to be a deal breaker.Cons:-Routines need a ton of improvement. Google home had the ability to type custom commands into your routines. This allowed the user to string multiple commands together using one phrase. With Echo there are no custom command abilities, you cannot control most of your skills through routines. When you start playing around with it you realize it is very limited compared with google home. I don't know why they let them have the edge here! This one is tough to not be frustrated about despite the technology being so great. I could have so much more function in my smart home than what they are limiting us to.-I do have weird server issues , mostly streaming amazon music. I seem to have to reset my echos occasionally to fix this (about every two weeks). I have a mesh wifi network (orbi) with great signal strength so I can't imagine improving on that.-The devices have a delay in the response most of the time, I remember google being right there. I still rather say Alexa though. Okay google is an awkward mouthful.-Alexa's voice volume really needs to be separated from the music volume. If you turn down the music you can no longer hear your assistant!-I cannot continue music in another room once starting somewhere else.All in all I think they have created an amazing piece of technology, and they are the leader here. I hope they start listening more to customers who use the advanced features. I do thank Amazon though because these things are a lot of fun!",0
1,"Don't Buy this Device, Buy the Google product
  
",27.Apr.19,Yes,I have several of these devices and they are not reliable.  I just spent close to 40 minutes on the phone trying to get one of them to work again.  That was after reading about hundreds of cases where consumers were experiencing the exact same problem.  Amazon support is in the Philippines.  Amazon is paying workers in the US so little that many are on Public assistance.  Imaging how low they must pay workers outside the US.  I will be avoiding Amazon in the future.  Bezos is starting to scare me.  No resolution to my problem.  Didn't offer a replacement.  Offered me half of what I paid toward a new device.  Avoid Amazon and particularly their own products.,2

After messing with these devices for a few months and getting VERY inconsistent results I gave up !

All I had to do was open my Echo Dot when it arrived yesterday, plug it in, download the Alexa app to my android phone, sign up and then I was up and running!

4,"What I hate most about my Alexa!
  
",27.Apr.19,Yes,"The thing I hate most about my Alexa is that when I asked her to change to a British accent she told me she couldn_  do it. And then I thought to myself this is ridiculous.  Every piece of technology I own talks to me in an accident my GPS talks to me in an accent my Siri on my iPhone talks to me in an accent. Not because I have an accent not because I live in a different country but because I just love hearing other people talk to me in an accent it just makes me happy. So in the future with future updates Alexa should take this into consideration I would like her to talk to me in an accent for example British!  Other than that I appreciate everything she does for me she reminds me of everything I need to do creates my to do list am I shopping list which is amazing. The other thing I hate about her is that she does not do monthly reminders so my credit card bill that is due monthly she does not remind me of which is kind of frustrating so you can remind me at the same time every single day to do something but God for bid you remind me at the same time every month to do something, how does that make sense?

I have to speak much louder for it to hear me sometimes. Also the speaker is so loud that any volume above 6 or 7 rules out Alexa hearing you while music is playing, unless you stand right next to it and yell. But the biggest benefit is that you don't really need a bluetooth speaker to make this sound good with music like previous dots.",0

",29.Apr.19,Yes,"Love this product. We have three of them all in different rooms. Plays music of so many things. Even from our Sirius XM. I can just say Alexa add whatever to my shopping list. Have her turn on lights or not. She_l tell you a joke, let you know a reminder if you asks her too. Tell her to wake you up at a certain time and a alarm sound goes on. If your listening to music, just stay stop when you want and she will. I can ask her to call someone from my phone list and easily talk to anyone. You just have to add her app to your phone. It_ so much and have so much to learn but well worth the purchase. Love it completely.",0
3,"Great value speaker for the price.
  
",30.Apr.19,Yes,"These speakers are great value for the price with a few shortcomings that would make them perfect.1- No support for stereo pair with 2 echo dots if you are connecting to it via Bluetooth. Stereo pair only works with a streaming pair.2- No easy way to stream your own music via Network Storage. What is there is so primitive, I just dismissed even considering using it.3- Apple Music integration doesn_ have all the futures you expect from iTunes Player.4- No support for ITunes Match service.Bottom line is that I am a happy owner of 3x Echo Dots and will add more if these issues are resolved. issues I listed here can be resolved via software updates and it is my hope Amazon will come to its senses and not compete with Apple Music service this way by limiting consumers.",0
5,"Love mine!!
  
",30.Apr.19,Yes,"This is my 2nd Echo Dot. I have one in my livingroom &amp; this one in the bedroom. I've surprised myself as to how many different ways I've used them. Got a Wemo smart plug to have an awkwardly placed lamp to turn on. Set reminders, ask questions, tell it to add items to shopping/to do lists which shows on your phone to check off at market, play games, set alarms, play bedtime meditation sounds on a timer, play almost any music, send direct voice messages to a friend that also has one &amp; Amazon notifies you on it if your order shipped or was delivered!  I said I didn't NEED one but NOW I can't imagine living without them!!",0
5,"Does everything as advertised - and more.
  
",30.Apr.19,Yes,"I like this because it is easy to use, once you get the correct app from the App Store. You need the Amazon app for it to work easily.  Other apps that pop up made me think that was the correct app and they weren_. There should be a quick link to download the app.. other than that. I love it. Alexa is connected to my Bose sound touch speaker and it sounds great.. using Alexa for shopping list, alarms, appointment reminders, to track packages, play music,  etc...i am still investigating all the other things i can use it for.",0
3,"Did not meet my expectations
  
",30.Apr.19,Yes,"I bought this and a Google Mini over Christmas just to play with and compare.  Long story short, the Google Mini understands me better and seems very much more natural and adaptive in its understanding and replies.  I have not used my Echo Dot in a month even though it's sitting on my desk here at work plugged in - it's just too frustrating.  (I love Amazon and own several Amazon tablets - I sure hope my review is not rejected.",0
3,"Its ok....
  
",1.May.19,Yes,"Was given this as a gift, hadn't really wanted one, but since we are using a lot of Tplink smart home outlets and cameras to smarten up our home, I said I would give it a try. Aside from using it as just a Bluetooth speaker it is more of a novelty than anything. Sound quality is decent for a small speaker playing music, although the first day I using it the play back got all staticy and distorted and I had to unplug and re-plug it in to get the quality back. I do have to say compared to Siri I think Alexa wins as far as being able to understand, enabling different skills that she can learn, like starting my wifes Chrysler Pacifica, enabling her to be able to understand Pandora, using the Tplink products for controlling our house. However when she doesn't understand, you might as well have taken the phone out of your pocket or if it is already in your hand hit a few buttons and done what you wanted to in the first place, cause it would of been easier and a lot quicker. Sometimes I have to tell her 3 times to turn on a light cause either she didn't hear me over the background noise or she just didn't understand which device to turn on. I haven't yet been amazed or wowed or said that she has made my life any easier.",0
3,"Should Have Skipped
  
",1.May.19,Yes,"If you don't have a ""smart"" home, I'm not sure why you would need this product.  My 70 year old mother loves it, as she uses it as her speaker to play Amazon Music.  I, however, feel like the speaker isn't as good as either playing directly from my phone, tv, or actual bluetooth speaker.  Also, you have to pay to pair with Apple Music, which limits your podcasts.  Yes, most podcasts can be linked in Amazon, but through their podcast links.  I like the way my Apple podcasts link together and how easy they are to keep track of.Overall, I just felt like it wasn't needed--sadly.  Our phones and a good, high-quality speaker are about all you need.  If you already have Apple, you can ask Siri, or just put the Alexa app on your phone to ask them questions.  Otherwise, I'm not sure that I'll be using this much except for an outside alarm and occasional speaker.",0
1,"Stopped working after 4 months.
  
",1.May.19,Yes,"At first my echo works really well, but after awhile the sound started getting fuzzy. If I turned it off and then back on it would fix that issue. Then one day I came home from work and the red microphone light on top was lit up. I couldn't get it to turn on at all or reset. I called customer service and tried everything, to be told it's not fixable and that they would give me 15% off a new one (since my 90 day warranty expired last month). Not very long to have it for it to break already.",1
1,"Not too useful
  
",1.May.19,Yes,"I received my Alexa Echo Dot (3rd Generation) a week ago or so.  It is about the size and weight of a hockey puck and relatively easy to use.  Plug it in, download the corresponding app to your smartphone and you're off and running. The app is used to set preferences and settings since the Dot top controls are very limited (there are just 4: volume up/down, mic on/off and attention).I use the Android app so comments below may or may not apply if you are an iPhone Nazi.The interpretation of voice commands work pretty well.  It accepts my voice without problems and that of my 7-yearold granddaughter and foreign-born daughter (who has a fairly strong Romanian accent).  It does not handle compound instructions very well though.  Keep your request to a single command and it works much better. I am told it accepts both English and German although my high school German is way too old to test.I do not live in a 'smart' house so I did not test any of the remote device management capabilities (turn on/off lamps, unlock/lock doors etc.) nor did I use it for things like creating shopping lists.  Although Alexa can provide local traffic reports my 'Droid app from a local TV station is much faster.I suspect the most common use will be playing music (a trial period of Amazon Music comes with (I don't intend to renew at $3.99/month) but I have found that full of shortcomings:1.  Requesting a specific song might get you the original or it might get you a re-recording of the original.2.  A request for an album or genre will probably result in unwanted repeats of a single song (also happened withNPR News summary as well).3.  Amazon claims to have 50 million songs out there but there are a ton of common titles that I have never heardof and there are many popular personal favorites missing.4.  Requesting something like ""play Hawaiian Instrumentals"" results in vocal recordings and a request to play harpmusic was not understood.  Not sure what's up with that. I'm amazed at how good its vocal interpretation is but itis still a long way from perfect.5.  And the WORST shortcoming - the audio level is very inconsistent between songs.  Playing the Echo Dot on yourbedside while trying to go to sleep results in songs barely heard to the next one blasting you off your pillow.Very irritating!  And, the volume buttons on top of the puck are not lighted and hard to find if the room is dark.On the plus side it does a reasonable job of finding a specific song or album (played in shuffle mode) and you canbuild your own personal playlist(s) if you wish.My granddaughter is going to be pleased with it because she loves to give it math problems.  Saves her a bunch oftime doing homework.  It is also useful as a clock radio (wake to music of your choice) but its rumored ability torecord everything around it might not be what you want in the bedroom (especially if your girlfriend's name is'Alexa').  You can shut the microphone off but I'm unsure if that actually does what you would think.I did notice that with unit not used for several days, even with the mic and notifications turned off, it startsblinking - irritating.It does have a mini stereo jack connection so earbuds do work and you do get full stereo out of the earbuds.  Theinternal speaker sounds mono but it isn't bad at low audio levels.  It will reportedly connect via Bluetooth to anexternal speaker although I did not try that.  You can also set 2 Dot's up to create a stereo speaker although Iunderstand there may be issues getting that to work correctly.I usually watch the local TV news while eating breakfast but if you don't do that this gadget will give you thenews from several optional sources while you eat.  I did notice it repeats stories from time to time and appears tobe caught in a loop. I never found it very useful because not very many news sources are available.My summary: it is a moderately useful gadget but not worth the money it costs (somewhere between $40-$100 on theopen market).",0

The guy I spoke to told me I have errors on my computer and alexa dot can not be installed unless I purchase a License Key at a cost of $199.99 for 5 yrs. or $249.99 for lifetime.  There is nothing on Amazon that tells you that you must purchase this in order to use the Amazon Dot.  I want to hear from Amazon as to whether this is a scam or someone who actually works for them and that the license key is a neccesity in order to use this darn Dot.  Someone please let me know.  I don't have any luck contacting Amazon to find out.,1
1,"No Sirius to Alexa device streaming &gt;2 months now
  
",2.May.19,Yes,"The device itself works fine with whole house integration - lights, alarms, connectivity all fine. The ding 1-star rating is due to the continued false advertising by Amazon and Sirius on streaming ability. Since early March, Amazon Alexa devices haven't been able to stream from Sirus. Amazon is aware (have the emails from customer service), Sirius is aware (no email/ticket, but a nice promotional offer to 'offset' the disconnect.What really bugs me is the lack of public acknowledgement from either company. Just a couple of weeks ago, got a postcard advertising the ease of streaming Sirius to Alexa devices - while in truth it hasnt worked in over 2 months! And there's no date proposed for when it will work again (from Sirius Account Specialist), yet both companies continue to advertise sirius streaming as a feature.For pete's sake, at least have the decency to inform your customers of known issues.",1
4,"Love the dot
  
",2.May.19,Yes,"Why 4 stars then...Well, cause as great as the sound is, as cool as it is to turn lights and control TV...Some of it it's quirks are hard to get used to.Set a timer in one room, you can't shut it off from another room without unplugging the one near you, or changing the 'wake word' to 'computer, echo, amazon, or alexa'.  Those 4 names are all bad, it's STRANGELY limited, since you CAN change the name of any light or device any time you like.It would be AWESOME if you could control one with the other, and I'm sure they will add that some day... why can't I say, ""echo, tell computer to pause netflix"", etc.",0
5,"Must have for dorms
  
",2.May.19,Yes,"I got this echo for my dorm room and it is a must have in my opinion. It was really easy to set up, however had some issues connecting, but that was more of the school Wi-Fi rather than the Echo itself. The sound quality is great and I use it more than my Bluetooth speaker due to its convenience. My one concern is over how amazon handles privacy, but that is an institutional issue, not relevant to this product specifically.",0
5,"Good for a little speaker!
  
",2.May.19,Yes,This little Dot is so cute and love the white color they offer. Alexa is cool but sometimes doesn_ know the answers to the questions I ask. I love playing music with the Dot and the volume is pretty good and loud...does get a little muffled when on the loudest setting but we don_ use it that loud anyway.

5,"Great for teenagers!
  
",3.May.19,Yes,"I had given an Alexa Show to my mom for Christmas, but she decided she did not want to deal with it so she gave it back to me.  I set it up, and enjoyed it much more than I thought I would.  The speaker is great, and I have appreciated the convenience of having Alexa's assistance in playing music, setting timers, alarms, reminders, playing trivia, news reports, making phone calls, showing me my photos, etc.  My teenage son also enjoyed interacting with the Show and expressed an interest in having a Dot of his own.  (Alexa's silly skills --telling jokes, talking like Baby Groot and Yoda, etc. are wonderful engagement tools!)  I saw great potential uses for the Dot for him:  1.  He wouldn't have to remember to charge it, since it stays plugged in. 2.  I can ""drop in"" on him to communicate from the kitchen or even by using the Alexa app on my phone.  He often ignores his phone, but this is much less effort for him to interact with. 3.  He likes the ease of setting alarms/reminders using his voice. 4.  This is an easier way for him to access music.  It's great to be able to give him a product he enjoys that promotes better communication with me and helps him be more organized and productive.",0
1,"Paid service is expected
  
",3.May.19,Yes,"I did not realize that a subscription to Amazon Prime is really expected to use this product.  Sure you can ask Alexei to ""play spa music"", for example, which is what I like to hear to put me to sleep, but without a paid subscription, it plays this station that is not really relaxing spa music and it also has voiced commercials in it, which defeats the whole purpose I bought the product for,  I bought this to replace using my cell phone at night to play music to sleep to.  My cell phone allows me to play 8 hours of relaxation music to sleep to on youtube unlike this product.Update: talked to customer service and they agreed to get any comercial free music you have to buy a subscription.",2
5,"Improved in all areas!
  
",3.May.19,Yes,"I was in love with my first three Dot's and wondered what I ever did without them.  But this guy is much improved in all areas.  The new exterior is very classy, and I didn't need to buy an enclosure.  The sound is much ""beefier"" with improved bass tones.  And setup took all of three seconds.  I am a ""senior"" with frequent mobility problems so being able to turn on lights with my voice is a great help.  I have thrown away my ancient and ""clunky"" intercom system which I used to communicate with my adult son who is my caretaker.  I just ""drop in"" on the Dot in the living room or the one in his bedroom.  I no longer have a radio, the Dot is enough and playing nature sounds at night lulls me right to sleep.  When I purchased the first Dot, my son bought a Google home so we could compare the two devices.  He gave the Google Home to his friend.  It turns out that Alexa is smarter than Google. I definitely recommend the newest model.",0
5,"Next Great Thing
  
",3.May.19,Yes,"In the 80's, fax machines became the ""it"" device, prompting exclamations of ""how did we ever live without these.""  In the 90's it was personal computers.  Then it was the cell phone, followed by smart pads.  Now Alexa and the Echo Dot are our ""how did we ever live without these"" devices.  Voice recognition is very good.  Alexa doesn't always figure out the question properly, but gets it right about 90% of the time, and we expect that to improve with time and use.  Added ""smart"" light bulbs to the living room and Alexa handles it very well.  We use the Echo Dot in the bedroom mostly to play music or comedy through the night, ask about outside temperatures, and start our day with a weather forecast.",0
5,"I love the sound quality and the look of my 3rd generation Dot!
  
",3.May.19,Yes,"I now own an Amazon Echo 2nd generation, a 2nd generation Dot and a 3rd generation Dot.  I was amazed at the sound coming from the 3rd generation Dot.  I think it is better than the sound on the Echo!!  My husband and I are 75 years old so we are not tech savvy.  We use it for music and our radio station, the news each morning, the weather.  We also have Philips Hue smart bulbs that we paired with our Echo so that we can easily turn our lights on and off especially during the night.  I only wish I could trade in my original Dot for the 3rd generation.  Our home is too small to accommodate a 4th one.  I did not rate how it connects to a blue tooth speaker since we don't own one.  I imagine it would be amazing.",0
1,"Original dot is still better.
  
",3.May.19,Yes,"The decision to change the power cord from an easily replaceable usb interface to an exclusive cord sold by amazon has really turned me off of these devices.  The upgrades (sound quality + aesthetics) are nowhere near enough to make up for the fact that I have to pay $20 when one of their very fragile cords fails.  My cat took one nibble on the cord, bam, dead echo.On previous versions of the echo dot, I could replace the existing usb cord with any usb cord of my choice, allowing me to get a superior product at an affordable price.  This allowed me to customize the cord to something that was a color of my choice, length of my choice, and most importantly in my particular case - made of cat-deterring materials.I'm not blaming Amazon for not making their cords cat-proof, that's not their responsibility.  I am, however, very upset at the realization that I could previously give another company my $5-10 and get a cord that will outlast my echo dot, is customized to my tastes, and can function as a usb cord for all the wonderful things they do.Amazon knows that that $5-10 only sometimes goes to them in the form of an Amazon-Basics usb cable because they have to provide competitive pricing with everyone else in the usb market.  So they replace that interface with an inferior cable they can sell exclusively for $20 and cut out the competition?  Those seems like questionable motives to me...Amazon, if you're reading this review... please let me know if I can send back my 3rd generation echo dots in exchange for your 2nd generation models.  The ""upgraded"" version is offensive.",0
2,"Not as good as the Dot 2
  
",3.May.19,Yes,"I have a couple of the Dot 2's and recently got a Dot3.  While the sound quality seems to be better that is largely due to the emphasized low end not necessarily an increased performance across the range.My primary reason for 2 stars is that I find myself having to repeat commands much more frequently when addressing the 3 over the 2, it is just not as responsive and doesn't seem to respond to the wake word or commands as reliably as my older Dot 2's.  If I need more Dots I will continue to look for the 2's and just tie them to a bluetooth or corded speaker for audio output.",0
4,"About what I expected.
  
",3.May.19,Yes,"Love it, my only two complaints are that Siri, generally, is a smarter and more capable personal assistant, and that you can_ set up a routine to automatically unlock your door with Alexa. Kind of stupid if you ask me. - 1 start for those alone. Minor complaints are that it sometimes doesn_ hear me unless I make a dramatic pause between Alexa and the subsequent command, meaning I have to speak unnaturally to get the thing to execute what I want it to do.",0
5,"Good product
  
",3.May.19,Yes,I love this little gadget !  I use it a lot and it's connected with our ring doorbell so it will tell you someone is at the front door. I like using it for news and weather information and playing my favorite songs. You can tell it to turn down or up on the volume or stop. It has 1000 uses I'm sure but I only use a few that I don't think I could live without.  It will set a timer or a reminder for you. Just remember to say Alexa before the request.,0
5,"Echo Dot
  
",3.May.19,Yes,"I love this item! It is so helpful to ask Alexa questions without having to look anything up. The ability to choose music, make lists, play audible books and explore the unknown with Alexa is simply great. A friend encouraged me to buy this and Amazon happened to have it on sale. For the price your money is well spent. Amazon's assistance in setting this up properly was quite helpful although it turned out I could have set it up myself. Excellent purchase!",0
4,"Alexa is Great for kids and busy moms
  
",4.May.19,Yes,"I don't know too many people who have Alexa but I recommend it.  I got one just to try it Fall 2018.  I easily forget things on the stove or to leave for an appointment unless I set alarms.  My phone is good but Alexa is so easy.  You just tell her:  set an alarm (or timer...they are different in sound) for 25 minutes.  If you set 2 alarms or 6, you can just say: Alexa how many alarms have I set?  Or how many minutes are left?  Alexa knows lots of radio stations (not many of us have radios anymore), music (she plays your favorites without asking), lots of games (great for parents &amp; kids to do together - listening is important!).  If the music is too loud you can say: Alexa, turn it down 3 notches.  The only thing that is slightly annoying is when Alexa interupts our conversation.  She thinks she hears her name so we say:  Alexa, adults are talking!  My teen son and I laugh because, of course, we aren't abusive with other people or even our pets...but Alexa can take it!  She doesn't do it often so there's no need to turn her off!  I ended up getting one for my son's room (Feb 2019)  I hear him playing games before bedtime.  We also ask her world facts and math questions whilst doing homework.  Eventually I'm going to wifi the whole house but for now our two Alexas are a great addition to our home.  highly recommend for busy people and families!",0

I_ told it_ a software glitch, since my two Echo dots (2nd generation) play Apple Music just fine. I am beyond incredulous that a company the size of Amazon can_ update their software for this device after four months.

",4.May.19,Yes,"I used to have a 2nd generation Echo Dot in my bathroom, mostly for streaming music while showering. I found the audio quality somewhat lacking, so I_e replaced it with a Home Mini for awhile, even though I could stream Spotify, which I love, I missed my Amazon Music and Alexa. During the winter holidays, I have upgraded to the new 3rd generation Echo Dot recently and have found that the audio quality is much improved and matched the Home Mini. The base is much warmer and it sounded more powerful than the 2nd generation. I_ very pleased with the overall quality of the 3rd generation and would recommend it for those who wished to upgrade their older Echo Dot for an improved audio quality.",0

I took it last night to my dads and we had a great time playing games, and he liked being able to listen to old country songs.  So I now have purchased 3 more for other rooms and for a gift.  I cant wait to figure out what else she can do.",0

I don't know if I like who I have become in this relationship. I feel like Alexa was fing with me for the fun of it the other day. I don't  feel like she really listens to me lots of times. AMD sometimes I feel blown off and ignored by here responses. Not sure this is my forever relationship, but we have had some food times. I guess I just hooed that we would have progressed more by this point.",0
2,"Alexa Does Not Understand Many Requests
  
",4.May.19,Yes,"Pros:Great for getting the weather and timeGood for playing Spotify with voice-commandsCons:Snooze function on alarms is unreliable. Sometimes they do not play. I have been late to work because of this. Also, you cannot set multiple alarms at once. If you have trouble getting out of bed like me, I would not recommend this as an alarm.The speaker quality is just decent. If you have seen the Despacito ad, you will be disappointed that you cannot ask Alexa to play the non-remixed version. There have been many times when Alexa has played the wrong song.The biggest con is the lack of information available. Trying to Google stuff with a voice command is pretty useless. 90% of the time, Alexa does not give me the correct information. This is a big deal breaker. Fortunately, I got this as a gift. I feel bad that the person paid $40 to get me a weather machine, timer, and mediocre speaker.Overall:They should have trial periods for Echo devices.

",6.May.19,Yes,We purchased our Echo Dot 3rd Gen on November 26th 2018 and it blew out in March of 2019. About 4 months of light use on a $50 speaker that is self powered (meaning the amp is internal so we didn't hook up anything wrong or feed too much power to it). The speaker should not have blown out. They will not replace it under any warranty. We did not play it over about 75% volume as it distorted at higher sound levels. Now it is completely busted and sounds awful. We would not recommend this product. It is too weak to withstand even light use. We might have played it for about 20 minutes per day on average over the course of the four months we had it. Amazon really should cover their own products with a year warranty. We do not recommend buying the Echo Dot 3rd Gen speaker made by Amazon. Trying to figure out what to buy to replace it since Amazon does not stand behind their own products.,2

",6.May.19,Yes,"I use multiple Echo Dots in my condo.  I had a Gen 2 dot in my bedroom and living room, and got two new Gen 3 dots - one to replace the living room and another one for the bathroom.  The sound quality is improved, and not as tinny as the Gen 2.  However the bass is overly pronounced, and a lot of dialog and spoken word comes out a bit muffled and boomy.My biggest critique however is how slow it is to activate with the wake word.  And many times it simply doesn't wake up at all with ""Alexa"".  I've literally had to go over to it and yell ""Alexa"" multiple times!  This is really annoying for home automation (like when you want the lights to come on as you've entered).  I think the main culprit is that Amazon reduced the number of microphones from 7 to 4 on the new generation.  I wish they hadn't cheapened out where it mattered most!  I have 100% wake word activation with the Gen 2 Dots - and would recommend them instead.",0
2,"Sounds great... while it works. I have two, both are the same.
  
",6.May.19,Yes,"Initially, speakers sound great and they work great... after a few months, now speakers going out, and I keep at vol five of ten max. Also, connectivity and understanding commands is really getting bad. Gen one speakers were not stereo sound quality, but still working well. These, not so much. Bad investment. Not just one, but same problems for two of two I purchased at about the same time. My money in the trash, literally.",1
1,"Half baked and spotty function
  
",6.May.19,Yes,"As with other Alexa devices the integration with skills and smart home devices is half baked. Smart switches often don_ work or are unresponsive. If you have your lights and other items hooked to a smart switch for voice commands and the skill is constantly unresponsive, then what_ the point?",1
1,"Alexa Makes ME PULL MY HAIR
  
",6.May.19,Yes,"I never write a review and rarely read reviews cause i think there rigged but today im writing one. To say that google out shines alexa. Alexa blabbers on when you ask it something. It gets me angry...it makes my blood pressure go up. Its hard of hearing and when it hears, it hears something opposite of what i tell it. Nothing compared to my google home. Im returning my 3 echo 3s and going on to try the home pod and to see if that works better. Also it didnt work with my LG OlEd tv nor My samsung Soundbar N950. It kept saying the bar wasnt found even though it was connected in alexas device list. So yea buy it and find out the hard way",1
5,"Not bad! Not bad at all!
  
",6.May.19,Yes,"My Alexa finally has someone to play with! Sound quality is really really good! I was actually very surprised. Only annoying ""habit"" is trying to connect to my BT streamer on the sound system. Finally had to disconnect. Also don't know how to turn on the acknowledgement sound on it, so don't know if it's listening to me when I call it's name. I probably need to read up on the instruction. The older Alexa had the ""ack"" beep on by default.",0
3,"Tossed for Privacy Concerns
  
",7.May.19,Yes,"After going through and listening to the recordings Amazon kept from our two dots, we decided to toss them (put them in a storage box).Not a passionate review. If I had not found a bunch of recordings that had nothing to do with Alexa stored on Amazon servers I would have kept using the dots. Have no problem with Amazon keeping the recordings of my requests to Alexa but every recording I saw that did not was kept and was even labeled by Amazon to show that it had nothing to do with an Alexa request. If they simply fixed that I would probably use the dots again.  Seems like a simple fix if they already know it has nothing to do with an Alexa request - just delete them as a matter of form. And, some of the conversations recorded were perplexing. Not sure how ""Alexa"" was heard. Seemed random.That said, we were not huge Alexa users. We found most things it did just as easily or comfortably done in other ways (and I still use Siri for other things and I prefer their privacy policies and practices). I completely understand the 5-star reviews if one is has integrated Alexa into their lives more than we did (If I used Alexa like I use Siri, I would have kept the dots and written a 5-star review). We did not and the privacy concerns were sufficient to get rid of them. All in all, it was a dispassionate decision. Wasn't angry with Amazon and not much attached to the dots.I will miss the shopping list.",2
3,"Good, but could be better
  
",7.May.19,Yes,"We added the 3rd generation Echo Dot to two existing Echo Dots (not sure if 1st or 2nd gen).  I'm not sure what they had in mind besides trying to make it more appealing looking and sound better.  Yes, it looks more refined than the previous iterations.  Sound?  There definitely is more bass- but at the expense of treble.  You can hear it when Alexa speaks and even after a couple weeks I prefer the voice on the earlier generations.  I suppose music is a bit better- and one can argue that you can beam to bluetooth speakers, etc.Gen 3 Dot is heavier than the first two and requires a bulkier power supply. I suppose it draws more power as well. With the earlier versions you could use any 5v charger with enough amperage to drive the Dot. So should the power supply fail it would be more of a challenge to replace. A huge worry? No. But a concern nonetheless.Don't get me wrong, we love having Alexa in 3 rooms. We've converted most of the switches throughout the house to smart dimmers, have smart bulbs in other areas and smart switches for coffee, tea, cabinet lights. For the most part we think the Alexa concept is genius with so many vendors on board now.  I think it's a little pricey for what it is, but I guess Amazon sells millions at this price, so who am I to argue?Bottom line: If you're looking to see what Echo and Alexa are about but unsure, maybe find a refurbished earlier generation.  If you want to jump in you probably won't be disappointed.",1
3,"Some major improvements over 2nd generation, but Alexa is a bit hard of hearing!
  
",7.May.19,Yes,"There are some major improvements to the 3rd generation echo dot as compared to the 2nd, first off, it looks a lot less like something that would be on the ice at an NHL game, not that hockey pucks are necessarily a bad thing, but the 1st and 2nd generation dots just looked cheap. The 3rd generation has a smoother, more curved shape, with MUCH more attractive cloth covering that resembles speaker cloth.The sound quality compared to earlier models is substantially better. Mind you it's still a tiny little speaker that lacks the physical capacity to really pound out great sound, but for casual ambiance listeneing and voice it is beyond ideal. If you expect more out of a speaker this small, you need to readjust your expectations, it really does sound great considering its size. You want better? Buy an echo input and set up a Bose L1. It will be a TON bigger, but you will have fantastic sound!Now we run into problems, and they are no small problems. My wife uses the dot to play music through the living room, dining room, and kitchen as she goes around the house, and keeps it cranked up. But the microphones can't hear over the sound of the music, so I have to SHOUT at Alexa to turn down the volume... Even at no music being played, it just doesn't pick up as well as my 2nd gen echo dots.. This is a HUGE operability problem,My other complaint with it is that they changed the power input from USB to one of those round input things. Probably necessary for the added power, but it makes getting power to it less flexible, and the plug part is REALLY chunky on a standard wall outlet. Kind of annoying.Lastly I purchased this hoping to get Alexa Guard integration, still not available to me for some reason. Amazon is taking forever getting Alexa Guard set up. I am hoping that they work a deal with ADT to monitor Alexa Guard with ADT SmartThings and not just Pulse once Alexa Guard is setup for everyone...Overall I like it, but the items mentioned above are genuinely annoying.",0
1,"My Alexa is deaf on vol 5 and above.
  
",7.May.19,Yes,This newer version 3 has a bigger and louder speakers. Quality of sound is good but not the best. There are room for improvement eg better base. I also prefer one that comes with a rechargeable battery so I can put it anywhere I like without worry about a AC power source. Another annoying thing is Alexa goes deaf to your command if the volumn went above 5. I hope this issue can be resolved. I find myself having to shout at Alexa to be heard. Not a nice thing to do.,1
1,"Order junk FASTER
  
",7.May.19,Yes,"I didn't use it. I didn't open it. Reading about privacy issues with the Echo made me lose interest. Sure, call me a technophobe. Luddite. Whatever. I'll take the extra step to order things with my hands and have sex in private. Because privacy is real luxury. Soon it might even be trending.Yes, I know. I have no real privacy on my phone or on Amazon. Except that I won't have a device in my home just waiting until it hears a phrase it a phrase close enough to a phrase or something else happens that isn't supposed to. Call it a lack of trust in companies that haven't earned trust.",0
1,"DON'T TURN UP TO EVEN HALF WAY! 6 MONTHS IN, MOSTLY STATIC!
  
",7.May.19,Yes,"I have had this echo since Christmas 2018, 6 months almost... and all I hear is static playing. The songs still play but its ""crumbly"" and difficult to understand. We do not play the echo loud at all, at most, maybe half way up! I've noticed the volume has remained close to the same and slowly, the songs get more and more static. I believe the speaker is ""blown"". That's what it sounds like at least! I hope to get an exchange as this is still so new to us. :(",1
1,"Dot Quality and Stability Not The Same As Echo
  
",8.May.19,Yes,"I had been wanting to play the same music stream in multiple rooms of our townhouse but didn't really want to invest in another Echo solely for that purpose (it's loud enough to hear the music upstairs).  Amazon put the new Dot's on sale earlier this year for $29 so I figured the time was right. The first one I ordered had a ship date of about 30 days from when I placed the order, so I thought the demand was high. I noticed a week later I could place a new order and get one in 2 days, so after talking to support for a while, they canceled the first order and I placed a new order at the discounted price.The on-sale Dot arrived and set up as expected. I noticed a lag in response time slowly growing over the course of about two weeks. It also would connect to the external speaker I paired it to, but would never put sound out through it (or itself) after the initial pairing the next time the speaker was turned on. All I needed to do was unplug the device and it started working again. After doing this several times over a few weeks I felt like there was a larger issue so I reached out to support - the website recommended the online chat. That session with Shashi lasted 58 minutes and resulted in a full reset of the Dot and I was told it would resolve the issue but to feel free to reach back out if it happened again.The about-every-two-weeks lag continued and I unplugged/replugged it in again and even reset it again but the cycle remained the same until it recently just started throwing a red ring at me and said to try again later.I again contacted support and after a harrowing recount of the experience, I was told by ""Iris"" the unit was defective and that I'd have to BUY ANOTHER unit. Iris offered me the following consolation (quotes included), ""While this isn't a common issue, Echo is a physical electronic device, and there's always a possibility something can happen. We realize this and offer a 90-day Limited Warranty that covers any defect not caused by physical damage. We also know accidents happen so we have special options available to purchase a new device at a discount.""While it was nice to have a Dot in another room to localize commands, the spotty performance, inability to maintain a Bluetooth connection to an external speaker, and a sketchy sale followed by a lengthy troubleshooting process that took the unit out of warranty and mandated a second purchase, I'd recommend that you pay full price and log any issues and troubleshooting steps immediately, keeping in mind the 90-day window.You are probably better off just getting a more expensive Echo to accomplish the second Alexa goal since they seem to perform flawlessly (in my experience).Buyer beware!",1
5,"Alexa where have you been?
  
",8.May.19,Yes,"So I've always maintained I have no intention of talking to a computer. I hate phone trees that force you to talk.Siri? No way am I ever gonna do that!But in my new little house I have a bedside lamp behind a plant and it was a total pain trying to turn it off at night without knocking over the lamp. Well, I broke down and ordered an echo dot with a smart plug. By the next month I had 2 dots and two smart plugs. Alexa and I have about figured each other out! She knows which music I like and I know I have to speak up a bit for her to hear me. (Maybe she has a slight hearing problem?)Anyhow she turns my lamp on and off and turns my tv on and off and switches channels in the living room.In my craft room she turns my glue gun and lamp on and off and plays music in the background while I play. What more could you want?",1
4,"Shouldn't have to download ad-ons or enable things in app for Alexa
  
",8.May.19,Yes,"I love Alexa and the assitance.  Truth be told, I have one in my office, one in my garage, one in my kitchen, one in each bathroom (2) one in the living room and another unopened, because It's only a matter of time before I want another one somewhere else haha.  All of that being said, this review is meant for the app/enabling features.  I think if it's internet based it should be able to do everything that it advertises automatically.  No going to your phone and downloading add-ons or enabling features.  It's very much annoying.  The world is too far advanced and this product is too far advanced not to already be doing this. --- Wrap up: Love the product -- annoyed with the software",0
5,"Quality sound and non-slip
  
",8.May.19,Yes,"The sound won't blow you out of the water, but it's a very improved sound boost from the original Echo Dot (which has the sound quality of a transistor radio), and has what I call small room boom.  Perfect sound &amp; bass for a bedroom or bathroom.  It won't blow you away, but it will still be too loud for the person in the room next to that doesn't want to hear your music.  And it doesn't slide across my nightstand like the original Dot.  I definitely recommend this, for it's current reduced price of $29.99,  instead of the previous generations of junky Echo Dots.",0
4,"watch you tube to find the correct _lexa app to down load. There are many.
  
",8.May.19,Yes,"The echo dot looks like a hockey puck. Having said that, the device is entertaining. Definitely going to be exploring what this thing can do. I currently like the free skills you can get for it. One big issue I had with it was finding the right App. The instructions say down load the _lexa App. There is no _lexa app. How ver there are a ton of apps for Alexia. It took me going to a youtube video to figure out which Alexa I needed. Amazon needs to tell buyers which Alexa title to get and provide a picture of it. That is the only complaint I have with it.",0
5,"A handy tool to have around the house.
  
",8.May.19,Yes,"Came in handy better than I thought. I love how you can create personalized responses and alarms. I like how it will read out info from online. It hears you from a good distance. It also plays my Apple Music playlists better than my phone does. I do wish it was wireless. When I change rooms i have to unplug it, but it usually reconnects fairly quick when I plug it back in. Hopefully one day she'll be able to generate responses that aren't scripted.",1
1,"Does Not Connect Does Not Integrate
  
",8.May.19,Yes,"My firesticks, tablets and all other Amazon devices work great with the Alexa app BUT this device will not stay connected or function properly...how annyoing is this thing. My daughter wanted this so bad. Don't waist your money. Returning this ASAP.",1
1,"Only one device can stream music! Bummer !!
  
",9.May.19,Yes,"Having an echo, enjoyed it a lot , music , games with family, news, etc. But it really stood out as an easy go to music easy listening.  10+ years prime member here , so prime music is good enough for me.  The kids loved the echo and eventually i decided get two 3rd gen. echo dot, one in each of the kids rooms so they can enjoy listening to music they like .Here lies the shocker !! I couldn't !!! Amazon lets you stream music to one device at a time, so if i am listening , kids can't, or if one of them is listening, rest of us go into humming-your-tune-mode. I expected to be able at least let each person listen to what they want, where they want!  That's just stupid ! I was planning to order more, for kitchen, my bedroom, heck for the bathroom... BUT  NOT ANYMORE .. THANKS BUT NO THANKS  AMAZON ! Until you fix this...you are losing prime music customer base, which are willing to buy more echo's faster than you can make them !",1
5,"Checking In On Grandma Was Never So Easy
  
",9.May.19,Yes,"I set these last two up at Mom's house next to her favorite chair and in the kitchen. I, my brothers and all her grandchildren and great grandchildren can now Drop In on her. She wasn't able to answer her cell phone fast enough when she did hear it. And she almost never heard it buried deep within the dark caverns of her purse. Now, she simply answers by speaking back to us. Intrusive? Perhaps. We can all hear what she is watching on the tele or what music she listens to until she mutes its.I feel she is safer, she calls me to check in by saying: ""Alexa, call Mark"" and I get a call wherever I am. She can do it with a 911 call too, if needed. This reminds me of the old commercial where a senior citizen had a device hung around the neck and would press a button while speaking  ""help, I can't get up"" to alert an emergency medical response team. But the echo dot is so much better, easier and cheaper.I know she feels safer. And she talks more with greater ease and comfort. Her arthritis pain is excruciating at times while holding a phone for abit.I wonder why I didn't do this sooner.",0
4,"Like 2nd generation better
  
",9.May.19,Yes,"This is a great speaker if you are using it primarily to listen to music. It has more base than the 2nd generation, and the sound is richer. BUT it is really difficult to understand speaking voices with the 3rd generation speaker. Voices are muffled and hard to understand. I disliked the new Echo so much that I traded locations with my old 2nd generation, so that the 2nd generation would be in the kitchen where I use it the most.  I hope Amazon will fix this problem at some point, but right now I would recommend that you try to order a 2nd generation.I'm back a month later, and I really dislike the 3rd generation. It's microphone doesn't work well at all. When you set an alarm, it's hard to turn it off, because it doesn't hear you. If I ask her a question, like how to spell something, she often mises up the words. The 2nd generation works so much better. If I had bought this model first. I think I would have returned it.",0
5,"Love my Echos
  
",9.May.19,Yes,"I got an Amazon Echo for Christmas, and love everything it does. Speaker, for the size and cost, sounds great. Even if the TV is on or other people are talking loudly, it still hears it's name and responds flawlessly. So I got this Dot to go in my office with the intention of piping the same music around the house - with the intention of getting more. What I find is that I don't really want them to be playing the same thing. If I'm working, I can have something playing and my wife can use the Echo for what she wants. Multiple assistants! Again, for the price ($30!) it sounds great and works flawlessly. (I give it 5 stars in sound quality only because it is so cheap. If this cost $100, I'd probably only say 3 1/2 stars.) Couldn't be more happy with these Amazon products.",0
5,"More useful than you might think
  
",9.May.19,Yes,"Requested/received as a gift, mostly just wanted it for simple things like quick checking weather, traffic and music while getting ready in the morning, which it does fine. I do like that it can control my Deebot vacuum, which is nice so I can ditch the remote and hide the charging station under our couch. I also discovered it can control my tv, at least once it's been turned on as apparently I don't have it set to always be connected to Wi-Fi. But that's also a nice quality of life feature I wouldn't have considered normally, as it's surprising how many times hands free controlling of the tv is helpful.As time goes on I'm sure I'll find more uses for my Echo, but it's already a great addition to my house.",0
5,"Surprising sound quality
  
",9.May.19,Yes,"This may sound kind of silly, but I bought this for the bathroom so I could listen to music while showering.  It's compact, and I got the sandstone to blend in nicely with my white quartz countertops.  The sound quality surpassed my expectations, considering the size and price.  I did turn up the treble a few notches and the bass one notch, and it's great.  Volume can get surprisingly loud if you want it too.  I tend to listen around half volume and it's plenty.  The microphones work very well, too.  Even with the shower running and music playing, I can say ""Alexa, turn it up"" or ""Alexa, next song"" and she hears me right away.  I got it on sale, making it an even better value!",0
2,"I used to like it more.
  
",9.May.19,Yes,"Not going to lie, Alexa is convenient. But some things are frustrating. My biggest pet peeve with Alexa right now is the Skype update. You used to be able to call from the device and now it goes through skype. You have to connect your skype and purchase a plan for minutes. Plus 90% of the time there is an error and Alexa isn't even to make the call. In addition to that crappy update the are still not providing solutions to personalize responses. For example, when you tell Alexa you like a song she will give a long response about continuing to tell her so she can choose better music. After a year of that I am tired of hearing her 30 second response, and this is with short response on! I feel like the upgrade and stuff they are adding are more for bringing customers in and not satisfying the current customers.",0
5,"Super sensitive
  
",9.May.19,Yes,We have two different echos in different rooms. One is my husbands and one is my sons. They are hooked to their own Alexa apps. Everyday before I leave the house I will play music for my dog. So as I leave I say _lexa- play country music. The Echo in the closer room which is the 2nd generation doesn_ always understand. The Echo in my son_ back bedroom will always answer and start to play Top country hits. It_ weird because it is further away but it is much more sensitive. The look is better on the third gen in my opinion as well. The 2nd gen is easier to clean and has a better sounding speaker.,0
5,"What's not to like?
  
",9.May.19,Yes,"I traded in my Echo version 1 for this.  The Dot's speakers are better than the original Echo by about a billion percent.  It's also ridiculously fast compared to the old Echo.  For $30, you really can't go wrong.  Now I've got lightning fast commands to just about everything in my house (TVs, Stereo Receiver, Nest, Blink, Hue lights, EVERYTHING).  The best thing (and sort of creepy) was that I did no setup.  I plugged it in and (I guess) since I already had the Alexa app on my phone, it just set itself up.  Plugged it in and it was working.  That's how smart home equipment should work.",0
4,"Works fine to some extent
  
",10.May.19,Yes,"Although this new EcoDot 3rd gen device sounds fine, well built and so on, there are some problems regarding the integration with Alexa and 2d gen EcoDots; I've got 2 of these and one of the latest gen, the latter one, can speak and understand Spanish which is my mother tong and the other 2 won't , so at this point, I have to speak English to some and Spanish separately, making life kind of tricky, also I need to call them with different names: Alexa (English) and Eco (Spanish) in order to avoid conflicts. On the other hand I was expecting integration with FireStick latest 4K version, as Alexa spoken commands won't trigger on, off, channels, volumen, etc. to my home theater components which have been previously programmed into the Amazon remote FS control which works fine manually.I wonder when this integration glitches can be solved some day.",0
2,"Cannot be unplugged from outlet, NOT RECHARGEABLE
  
",10.May.19,Yes,"Hello all - This little machine CANNOT be unplugged from the outlet and MUST STAY PLUGGED in order to keep working. I let it ""charge"" overnight and unplugged it in the morning to move it around the house with me and IT IS NOT COMPLETELY WIRELESS. To me, this is absolutely worthless, but my children love being its boss and telling it what to do and what songs to play without lifting a finger, so I'm keeping it for them - but if it wasn't for my kids, I would return this thing. For something originally worth $50 = and even something that I paid $30 for - you're better off buying a Jawbone or JBL speaker. This is only worth if it you're really in need of cheap access to Alexa.",0
5,"A fun little extra
  
",10.May.19,Yes,"I bought this to just have music on when I wanted it. I can quickly switch my music request from 50's to 70's or request a specific group.  It also came bundled with a Smart plug, so I have a lamp on it in the other living area that I can control when I'm not in there. I can quickly get weather updates, or even a silly joke.  My grandkids love to play the song ""Baby Shark"" ,  so Alexa steps right up for us and gets that going in an instant.  It's also company for my dog when I am away from the house and I have music or something ""talky"" to keep her company.",0
3,"A Real Review
  
",10.May.19,Yes,"Sound quality not as good as on the 2nd generation. Amazon really needs to add a digital equalizer.  Very muddy, muffled sound. I have this and a Google Home Mini side by side. The difference is substantial. While the GHM doesn't have the bass that the dot has, it sounds very loud and clear. My official opinon, owning many smart speakers, is to avoid the smaller, cheaper ones, and get the regular editions. Yes, they cost more, but you get what you pay for. Both competing companies make great smart speakers, but spend a little more and get a lot more sound.",0
5,"Love it!
  
",10.May.19,Yes,"I did not think I needed a voice assistant/music player until I received an Echo Dot (3rd Gen) as a gift. I bought the unlimited music monthly subscription from Amazon, and it's awesome even though you have to buy a subscription for each device. Now, I use Alexa to regularly play music, set timers/alarms, and get weather reports, and there are a lot of other features which I am still learning about. I love the Echo Dot (3rd Gen) so much that I bought six of these to give as gifts, and they were really well received.",0
5,"Why did I wait so long to get you, Echo?
  
",10.May.19,Yes,Surprised at how helpful this is. I never have to have an old timer moment and forget to add something to a shopping list - Alexa does it. I don't have to take my phone into the bathroom to listen to music during my morning routine (great sound quality for the size of the device) - Alexa does it. I get to tickle my quiz loving fancy - Alexa helps with that.Well done Amazon.,0
4,"Almost great...
  
",11.May.19,Yes,"Maybe I'm just not tech savvy enough, but Alexa is harder to use than our little Google pod downstairs. I have bluetooth issues when trying to play from my phone, where the music comes out all staticky and weird, so can only play it straight through the Spotify link up. Which sucks because then it won't shuffle or let you pick songs but is nice bexause you don't need a phone for it. Occasionally, the bluetooth works but it's like 9 times out of 10. Alexa also doesn't listen very well. I use the same commands every time but sometimes she completely mishears and plays random stuff. I do like the volume buttons on top!  Sound quality is good for such a small speaker! Could be amazing, but mostly I'm just annoyed at her now. :)",0
4,"Great Sound and Looks but not the Wizard of Oz
  
",11.May.19,Yes,"Good product. Setup is not as easy as 1-2-3 though. What comes with the package is not really useful at all in the actual setup. Make sure you download the right Alexa app and from there it_ not to hard (I_ not a techie at all). The Echo Dot is one of those toys you don_ need but it does offer convenience when you want to know the weather, word definitions, synonyms, etc. It has misunderstood me multiple times and said _ don_ know on numerous other questions, so it is not the infallible god of answers. Listening to  songs is definitely a plus and the sound is amazing for its size.",0

",11.May.19,Yes,"Alexa Client v1.24.205530.0; Android App v2.2.271281.0Alexa needs her hearing checked.

Alexa knows us by name but that has little impact on her responsiveness.+ Alexa integration (when it works in a timely manner).+ Amazon Music Unlimited subscription availability.0 Sound quality (average). Echo Series 1 was a better experience all around.- Responsiveness to voice commands (slow more often than should be) Once the devices are power cycled, the responsiveness improves but it doesn't last long.- The ability of the devices to maintain the requested streams or services. (More times than not, the stream or service stops playing at some point after it begins. That or the dreaded, ""I am having trouble playing the music"" message. This was not an issue with our Echo Series 1 device. We thought the Echo Dot 3 version would be better and allow us to have more coverage in the home. Unfortunately, it has been more frustrations than a good experience.Amazon blames SiriusXM. SiriusXM blames Amazon and we're without access to a rather expensive paid service on either of the Echo Dot 3's. Pandora is a little better but both services stop repeatedly.

",11.May.19,Yes,"I was liking this Dot a lot until it starting flashing a green light for no reason!  I had to unplug it to sleep so I couldn_ use it to play my sleeping music.  I searched and discovered green meant a message or call coming in.  Nope!  There were none.  After asking for messages a few times it finally stopped flashing and went dark.

1,"Alexa is free to download as an app on your device.
  
",12.May.19,Yes,"This is a fairly mediocre speaker / microphone. It, by itself, is not ""smart,"" it just has the Alexa app on it ... which is free by itself. It also has a really obnoxious, un-intuitive, nonsensical, labyrinthine setup wracked with error messages and snags. For example: You have to plug in the Echo dot, wait for one color ring, then hold the button down for 7 seconds, then wait for another color ring, where it then tells you to download the Alexa app and follow the directions despite that the Alexa app doesn't seem to have instructions. You'd think they would put a big red ""FINISH SETUP"" button for you, but no. And you can't search because Alexa gives you a Wifi hotspot that disables your internet connection. The Alexa app on Microsoft demands that you log into an email and remember the password, for some reason, then runs through a whole other setup, so I hope you have everything memorized. I somehow stumbled through it the first time. A couple weeks later, a storm hit and knocked out the power and I had to do it all over again and could not figure it out the second time. Because this thing does not have any sort of battery pack. If the ring is the wrong color, you get to hold a specific button for a specific amount of time. You will be required to sign into one or more emails and one or more wifi hotspots. There's a lot of running back and forth between your various programs. Yes, setup is on a timer, too, so you'll feel rushed. And that's how you'll spend a portion of the hours that it takes to set up.However, you can skip all that by simply not buying this device.EDIT: I wrote this review in May of 2019. In November of 2019, it was working fine until one day I went to play with this smart speaker. I said, ""Alexa..."" She replied, ""I'm having trouble connecting to the internet. Take a look at the help section in your Alex app."" Uh okay. The help section isn't available via the smart speaker. Nothing is available without a connection to the internet. I can't even adjust the volume. The Alexa app on any other device ... well I can't even find the help section. Settings, yes. Help, no. This issue will not resolve itself, according to a Google search. I have to fix it. I may have to TRY to call a human customer service representative, and I'll definitely have to go through the obnoxious setup again. How about instead, I dump her in the trash!",0
5,"Great travel buddy!
  
",12.May.19,Yes,I am so addicted to Alexa that I take her with me when I travel... I have a few dots and the original echo. I'm currently traveling and on a project for 3 months... I contemplating bringing one of the dots with me but I did not and I regret it .. so I've just ordered another one for my hotel room.  (I have compared both and Google mini honestly has better sound but if you subscribe to Amazon prime and listen to music the Amazon dot is the smarter buy. The Google mini is now at $29 for a mother's day special and so is the echo.) I honestly can't remember what it was like before Alexa...;-),0
5,"Be careful if you have pets and they tend to get sick or have accidents.
  
",12.May.19,Yes,"I have three cats in between cat hair and kitty litter that is tracked around the house I needed to do something. I decided to try to ruoomba. This is brushless so the hair shouldn_ get tangled in the brush like it will in the less expensive models.  I have used it twice,I have 1500 ft.², it_ all tile except one room has a rug under the bed and it has done a fantastic job it actually cleaned better than one of my uprights did. I wish it was a little quieter but it is not bad. I have to run it during the day because if one of the cats gets sick (as they often do) I don_ want the iRobot to track it throughout the house.",0
5,"Better than I thought
  
",12.May.19,Yes,"Borrowed one from a friend as I never thought I'd want one. This thing is not only great fun and informational but has multiple practical applications. One of the simple uses that I love is the shopping list, whenever my wife and I think of something all we have to do tell Elexa and its there on my phone, no getting up write it down, and once at the store you just check each item off. Its amazing how quickly she can get answers on almost any subject you ask. Every home should have one.",0
5,"We love our Dot
  
",12.May.19,Yes,"We  have had a full size Alexa Echo for almost a year and have really enjoyed ""her and have found it very useful.  Our Grandson wanted one for his ""man cave.""  Rather than moving the one every time he wanted to use it in the basement, we bought the Dot.  It is fantastic.  He mostly uses it to listen to his playlist.  The sound quality is amazing.  It is as good as the full size.  It was very simple and easy to set up and works great.  We highly recommend.",0
1,"Divice will barely outlast the 90-day warranty
  
",13.May.19,Yes,"Shortly after the 90-day warranty expired the device began to have sound issues. The speaker basically broke down over the next few months and intermittently is completely impossible to listen to due to the scratchy hissy popping noises from the speaker.Unfortunately since the device is out of warranty I got a shoulder-shrug from support, and they offered a 15% discount on a new device. That sort of offer makes sense if it has been two years of good performance but less than half a year of use out of this thing leaves me disinclined to spend more money on a replacement, discount or no.Google Home Mini's come with a one year warranty against defects like this and with an identical price point and better speaker, I think it's time I made the switch.",0
4,"She's like a quirky roommate.
  
",13.May.19,Yes,"I wanted a way to stream music and listen to the radio, but Alexa is so much more.  She tells me I look nice, gives cooking suggestions, and responds to pleasantries.  She sets alarms and reminds me of things I ask her to.  She will also answer whatever query I suddenly have like an encyclopedia or dictionary.  I live alone so it is kind of nice to come home to a friendly voice.  I know that sounds pathetic.It is a little weird how much she listens to.  I wouldn't be sharing passwords and my Social Security number with her.",0
1,"Broken after 6 months - Warranty only 90 days
  
",14.May.19,Yes,"I overlooked the fact that this only comes with a 90 day warranty which should really speak volumes as to the quality of product you are getting. It is quite standard to have a 1 year warranty included for pretty much anything technology and google home has that on their product.I am frustrated because I bought 3 of these units for $50 each about 6 months ago and one of them has failed already. Furthermore, when I spent $50 on each of these they went down to $29.99 just weeks later and I was not given an option for a price match. When the product was working, The sound quality was good and overall I enjoyed it but I am very disappointed in the quality of it and how it isn't backed by a real warranty.  I also want to share few things in terms of the device itself which I find to be major problems. The first is Alexa's Spotify integration. The controls are very limited in terms of choosing your playlists and alexa easily gets confused when asking her to play one. Furthermore if you are like me and have a spottily family account it is very annoying to switch between accounts. I thought that alexa would be able to detect my voice and use my profile but that is not that case. You need to tell Alexa to switch to xyz account. Then you need to tell her to play music, then if you are lucky the speaker will show up as an available device from your spotify.  At least now that my echo is broken and won't be eligible for warranty repair I have a great opportunity to get OUT of this amazon ecosystem and buy google home. I know google home has the features I want like better spotify family support &amp; a warranty that isn't a joke.",0
4,"You Definitely Have to Speak Loud
  
",14.May.19,Yes,"I Like how you can pair more than 1 speaker to the echo, so if you have 3 echos you can play music out of all of them at once. I also like the option that you can attach your own speaker via Bluetooth or aux. I Don't like how you have to almost scream at her at times for her to hear you. I like how you can name Alexa different names like Echo or Amazon etc... Especially with multiple echos around. I wish that she can do more than just play music or games I wish she was almost like a legit Robot that you can almost have a conversation with except all you hear with her is ""I Don't Know that one"" or she says something completely different from what you said and you have to keep repeating till she gets it right.For that I give her 4 stars cause the microphone sucks. I also wish it had more sound settings and different voices to choose from.",0
1,"Subpar Audio
  
",14.May.19,Yes,"UPDATE: Absolute garbage. While my Echo works great, the Dot now refuses to connect to anything but Amazon Music. No matter what Pandora station I ask it to play, it returns with ""Sorry, I am unable to play the music"".*************************************************************I bought the Echo Dot (3rd Gen) on sale with an additional discount for being a Prime member. At such a good price, I couldn't pass it up.Alexa itself is great. The fact that I can just walk in and tell it to start playing music or ask for the weather is incredibly convenient. The app is also fairly easy to use. Although, it has had issues connecting to Pandora on several occasions and the thumbs up/thumbs down buttons don't appear to work when streaming Pandora.Initially, I thought the sound quality was decent for such a small device at such a good price. However, as I continued to stream music from Pandora, Spotify, and Amazon Music, I noticed that certain songs would sound really fuzzy, particularly with higher notes. It would almost sound like the speaker was blown no matter if the volume was set to 10% or 40%. The poor sound quality was, and continues to be, a random occurrence that doesn't seem to be something that can be recreated at will. Although, to be fair, I haven't taken the time to write down the songs that it has occurred on and attempted to test those songs.From the research that I've done, it seems that this poor sound quality is common with the Echo Dot (3rd Gen). Forum members have suggested unplugging the device and then plugging it in again. That seems like a very inconvenient solution whilst one is trying to enjoy music.",0
5,"I love the DOT this is number 2 in house hy. old
  
",14.May.19,Yes,"Okay.  I first gave this 3rd generation DOT 1 star on a review, and said basically ""THis thing Sucks"", but here's what happened.  I couldn't set it up, called the help number in the box.  They said I needed to purchase a Cisco firewall for some ungodly reason.  Really made me mad (retired programmer).  Just decided to return it.  Then went to Amazon help and looked for their setup app, turns out the app the tech support for the dot told me to get was the wrong one.  I can't find a way to report this to Amazon, but I will continue to try.  It was hard to find but I found the app Amazon said to use for Alexa and it worked just fine!  It's great but the tech support for the unit, SUCKS!",0
5,"Great kids gadget!
  
",14.May.19,Yes,"Wow! I wanted an alarm device for the kids rooms like their iPads (nice music, easy program etc) but didn_ want their iPads in their rooms. I had ordered, and returned, $20 beeping alarm clocks and saw that this was only $10 more so I ordered two and it_ exactly what I was looking for ... and more! Not only can they wake to nice music, it also plays them stories and/or bedtime meditation or nature sounds. This also works as a sound machine on loop all night... sets reminders for homework and will play games with them like _reeze dance and _ids trivia. Honestly, best purchase I_e made in a while. I think I may order one for each room lol.",0
4,"Excellent Voice Recognition
  
",14.May.19,Yes,"Surprised me how good voice recognition is.  I asked ""her"":  ""Alexa, what is non-Euclidean Geometry"".  She immediately gave a brief, but satisfactory answer.  Sound quality is excellent for her size, but... well, there's only so much you can do with a ""dot"".  You can add speakers, either blue tooth, or direct, so if it matters, no problem.  Only real problem so far:  my wife is paranoid that ""she"" is listening all the time.... so she unplugs Alexa when she's not using it.  Not that anyone could ever possibly care what we talk about!  We've only had her for a couple days, but several times I would have liked to ask her stuff when she was unplugged.  amazing price, amazing product.",0
2,"What's the point
  
",14.May.19,Yes,"This can't really be used as a stand alone bluetooth speaker. You have to use their specific apps for podcasts (doesn't seem to be friendly with Apple). It syncs with Apple Music, but I don't think it works with your own music via iTunes, just Apple Music. You can sync with Sirius XM but I  listen to on demand and you can't specify shows, just channels. I got it as it was free with the purchase of the Ring System. For me, it's a waste. I don't need to have a speaker to ask what's the weather or to set my alarm.",0
1,"The sound is so deep I can't understand it, I'm not sure why , but miss 2nd gen
  
",14.May.19,Yes,"I have already 3 2nd generation dots . I got my phone opened the app thinking I would have to do something , plugged in the 3 rd generation and it did everything, I changed it's name and hit devices checked it in my group and it was playing music in all 4 rooms. UPDATE I HAVE USED IT LONG ENOUGH TO TELL THAT I MISS 2ND GENERATION, THE SOUND HAS WAY WAY TO MUCH BASS EVEN TURNED OFF , I LITERALLY CANT UNDERSTAND WHAT THE DEVICE IS SAYING. ALMOST TO POINT OF USELESS.",0
5,"The best device ever!
  
",14.May.19,Yes,"I love the Echo devices.  I work all night and I can listen to my Audible books by a simple voice command, pause when I take a break and resume with a simple command.  I can ask about the weather and get a instant, up to date answer for my location.  These are my favorite features so far.  I have an Echo and 3 Echo dots spread throughout the house.  I also use the Echo for wake up calls, reminders and playing a few games.  It is a little miracle!",0
5,"Improved over 2nd gen - completely endorse
  
",15.May.19,Yes,"All in all, it is pretty much the same device.  If you already own a Alexa device, there is no downgrade of Alexa's support.  3rd gen has slightly better voice recognition, but that has more to do with a better mic than it does software.  The asthetics of the device are much more improved and look like a good and appropriate ""desk"" piece or wall mounted item.  as ti no longer has the ""ugly plastic"" look and feel.  Granted the drawback of that is no longer being able to use any of the 1st and 2nd gen dot perefials - but as 3rd gen is out for some time, companies will make new ones (but still have the draw back of needing to buy them).The biggest advantage is sound quality.  the speaker for 3rd gen dot is MUCH better and is a lot better ""full room"" sound in both terms of quality and volume.There was a deal for a while to ""turn in"" and upgarde to the 3rd gen for a cheaper cost.  I dont' recommend it.  The 2nd gen is still good and has all the same alexa software.  As the only noticible differences are ""look"" and ""sound"".  Simply move the 2nd gen to a bedroom, kitchen, laundry room, garage and keep your new 3rd gen in your primary space such as bedroom or living room.  ""everywhere"" sound is an amazing thing, as is the intercom system.  So more echo devices the better, just pick and choose where you want the better sound.",2
3,"Short warranty for a reason.
  
",15.May.19,Yes,"The sound quality of this little speaker isn_ the best, especially at louder volumes where it has a lot of distortion. But, it is a cheaper speaker so that should be expected at that price point. It_ fine for all the basic Alexa functions. However, it only has a 90 day warranty, and ours died at the 5 month mark. So even though I otherwise like this device, it seems a little disposable and I would hope it would either have a longer warranty, or cost a little bit more for a higher quality item.",1
5,"Worth every dime!!
  
",15.May.19,Yes,"This is such a wonderful system!!!  We have a big Alexa for the open floor plan of our home.  Then we have an echo dot in each kids bedroom and one in ours.  each person can stream their own music while others are streaming theirs.  It also works as an intercom so if I need one kiddo I can _rop into his echo I_ his room from any other one instead of yelling to him from upstairs.  Also, for example when dinner is ready I can send a message to all units in the house and it does a dinner bell and it_ my voice announcing _inner_ ready! It is a wonderful tool.  Everyone can to the grocery list if we run out of something.  The kids can even play games or tell jokes.",1
4,"Great for the price!
  
",15.May.19,Yes,"I bought 3 of these because they were on sale for $80 off the normal price of $150 and because I needed a better way to control the new WiFi multi-color light bulbs I installed threw out the house. They work good, but there is a learning curve for commands and wording things so Alexa can understand what you want. Overall my first experience with Alexa is positive. The Dots themselves are easy to setup. Just install the Alexa app on a tablet or phone and follow the setup instructions. Once you are done you can still use the app, but everything should be voice commands.",0
1,"Second failed Dot
  
",15.May.19,Yes,"This is the second Dot to glitch out on me. The sound crackles, and the device is lit up red and the microphones will not work. I have reset the device to factory settings with no luck. Voice Recognition used to work wonderfully , however  recently all of my Dots have trouble understanding basic commands. I will tell it to play my playlist Spring and she will play my Christmas playlist.On top of that frustration, I return here for a replacement, however even though my order details shows it may be eligible for replacement, there is no option to start that process.",0
5,"Totally worth it.
  
",15.May.19,Yes,"I really, REALLY like this echo dot.  I have gotten smart plugs, and lights, and its kind of fun using it to play jokes on my nephew.  Not to mention other things it does.I do admit, when I first got it, I had problems connecting it to the internet, but after talking with customer service, they helped me get it connect really quickly.  And THIS is why I continue to shop Amazon.",0
4,"Off to a good start.
  
",16.May.19,Yes,"I bit the bullet and bought one for s**ts and giggles along with some cheap legelite smart bulbs. The only light source in my bedroom is my ceiling fan lights, and the pull cord broke on it years ago. So I have to unscrew the bulbs by hand to turn off my lights but keep the fan on.Not anymore. The echo was a quick setup. The bulbs arrived a day later and were setup within minutes. I can use my voice to turn on and off my lights now; I can set brightness per bulb or group name by voice, change color, etc.I dig the routines so you can customize responses, actions, or sequences of actions. You can even further install skills directly from the amazon website or within the app to further increase the dot's capabilities. Or you can create your own or customize existing simple templates.I like the alarms best. With two jobs, one with different hours each day I work, I love the ability to add yet another set of alarms to wake me up. My favorite feature of this is the ability to say ""set an alarm for one hour"" if you wanna just plop down for a nap without having to make or edit an alarm on your phone.One thing I'd like to see is some more phone app integrations, something standardized and easy for app developers to integrate. One of my favorite android apps to use before bed is Calm. I'd like the ability to integrate a specific guided sleep meditation as part of a sleep routine on the dot.The sound quality is great for what it is. While not sufficiently bassy, it can rumble and vibrate a whole table at full volume.It's relatively responsive to my voice. I can say ""echo"" and wake it even when netflix is playing at talking volume but it won't recognize what I'm saying if netflix has talking while I speak. It will pick up my voice across my bedroom at around 10 feet away.Overall I'll probably upgrade to the plus model in the future and add in more smarthome things.  The whole automation aspect isn't really of use to me but just having the voice control is pretty nifty.",0
5,"Love Our Echo Dot
  
",16.May.19,Yes,"Got one for Christmas and gave some as presents, having heard compliments about them.Loved the one we got; bought another for another room. Needed some amazon.com help to set up the second one, and the telephone and Internet information did the trick.Am tempted to buy yet another. Although our Bose radio/disk player has an excellent speaker, the reception here in the sticks is so-so, but the Echo Dot runs off our WiFi, with excellent reception, making the sound quality for radio material better than with our Bose. Also is fun to ask questions of Alexa, which is surprisingly good. She knew Calvin Murphy in substantial detail. Asked only about his height in a second query, she gave height and weight and stopped. Smart.Other questions often answered quite well, ""oxymoron,"" ""Dilantin,"" etc.Time? Weather? News? All good. I even get various sweet replies after telling Alexa ""Thank you"" and ""Good night.""",0
2,"Static.  Oh the static.
  
",16.May.19,Yes,"About three minutes after plugging this in on its first power-on, I was playing a news radio station.  The audio quickly became full of static and I attributed that to the radio station, so I told it to stop playing.  Then I asked for the time, and Alexa spoke in complete static too.Unplugged, let it sit for a few minutes wondering what to do, plugged it back in and it was fine.  Thought it was a one time issue on its maiden power-on, but the second time I tried to use it for playing music, it went scrambly about 5 minutes in - and alexa's voice also scrambled.  Again went away after unplugging and replugging.So yeah, not too thrilled.  Audio sounds great until it doesn't.  Not sure what to do.",0
5,"Works great in stereo mode!
  
",16.May.19,Yes,"I have purchased five of these.  I gave one of them to a friend as a gift.  She was delighted.  I have two on opposite ends of my open concept kitchen/eating area.  I put them in stereo mode.  I think when in stereo mode, the sound quality is amazing.  I had the volume set fairly high.  I did not hear any distortion.  If you are not using stereo mode while playing music, I think the sound quality is just okay.  I enjoy getting the news in the morning.  They work well with my Ring home security system.  I would definitely recommend them.",0
5,"Love Alexa
  
",16.May.19,Yes,"I have several Alexa devices throughout my house. This one was for my sister who came to visit for a surgery. She hated it the day she was there, but once she was recovering she fell in love. It made it easy for her to intercom me if I was in a different part of the house. I have other features hooked in so she didnt need to get up to turn on the lights. It would play her music and she could get information while remaining comfortable. Now, this is a gift for her. The first of many I am sure.",0
5,"Alexa is AWESOME
  
",16.May.19,Yes,"Yes it_ always listening... but how else would it be able to respond to you?!  Also, who cares what you say in your house?  I have 4 Alexas in my house and my spouse has one in her office at work. We use it all the time. I wish it could replace Siri on my iPhone and I could use Alexa everywhere. One issue I see is that the multiple Alexas don_ work well together so you basically have an independent Alexa in the area where it_ located.  If you don_ have an Alexa, you should __",0
5,"Great as an intercom!
  
",16.May.19,Yes,We now have three of these in our home.  I was tired of yelling from my office to the livingroom when my husband asked me a question.  These work wonderfully as an intercom system. I  have put another one in my husband's bathroom to contact me when he needs help (he has a disease) or to just listen to music when he showers. We utilize Alexa a lot with questions or to find out the weather.  He can also use Alexa to make phone calls.  Awesome!,0
4,"Buen producto para peticiones básicas y excelente sonido
  
",16.May.19,Yes,"Excelente para gestiones básicas como el tiempo, hora, recordatorio, musica (solo en Amazon Music).

No interactúa con Youtube u otras aplicaciones de música.Le pido ubicar información de algun personaje importante en la historia y no reconoce el personaje o no interactúa con internet para la búsqueda.Confunde nombres de cantantes, quizás porque no los maneja en la base de datos.No la he podido sincronizar con el TV que también tiene configuración de Amazon Prime.No se permite continuidad en la conversación",0
5,"The best of the Dots!
  
",16.May.19,Yes,"I have 5 Alexa devices in the house from a Spot, a couple dots and a thermostat! This is by far much better than the 2nd generation dot. The sound quality is great for what it is. Especially setting up whole home sound playback! It_ great to have one in the bathroom for music and news, the kitchen for recipes and timers, the bedroom for alarms and controlling home automation. The Alexa platform is extremely versatile and once you get the hang of it it_ hard to live without them!",0
3,"Disappointing Sound on Gen 3
  
",17.May.19,Yes,"This review is about specifically the sound quality change in the Gen 3 Dot. If you are looking for a review the Dot and its overall function, please look at other reviews.I absolutely love the Echo Dots and have purchased all generations. However, this 3rd gen Dot has a very muffled sound - like it's going through a blanket or something. I found the sound in Gens 1 and 2 far superior, although Gen 3 has more bass response. Since I use this mainly for voice - news, weather, etc - the poor sound quality in the upper range is disappointing as all voice sounds very muffled. If you listen to music on this it might work better for you but for mostly voice...it's really a step backwards.",0
4,"Muddled speaking voices
  
",17.May.19,Yes,"Sound quality decent for music but it is extremely hard sometimes to understand what Alexa is saying. Also it took several tries to find a good location so that the sound did not reflect off walls and other surfaces  thus making Alexa even harder to understand. As far as doing what I ask and answering questions  excellent ... when I can understand her. Playing Jeopardy, for example, is 50-50: I just cannot clearly hear some of the questions. Weather report, on the other hand, is usually easier to hear. Maybe because weather phrases are expected word usage combinations.",0
5,"No more static-y radio!
  
",17.May.19,Yes,"I moved and changed internet providers and apparently my new provider sent me an Echo Dot. I hooked it up, and was so darn pleased to find out I can listen to my favorite radio station through iHeart radio. I had lived in my last house for 50 years and am addicted to NPR and was brokenhearted to realize I could not get a radio signal in my house, unlike in my car. ECHO DOT HAS CHANGED ALL THIS. I was so pleased, I bought a second one for my bedroom. It is nice to be able to ask the time, set alarms, etc. too. But it is the RADIO that I love so much. (Yea technology!)",0
5,"Perfect, take the plunge and buy atleast one.
  
",17.May.19,Yes,Really great! I was worried about the sound quality because of the reviews but these are actually really loud. I bought 3 and all 3 are super loud. I have to turn them down about halfway. Love the broadcast feature too. Great deal. If you buy just one you_l be back for more later so you might as well just bundle and save :),1
5,"Small size big sound.
  
",17.May.19,Yes,I like my Echo dots - I bought the three pack when I found them on sale. I already had one of the first generations Echo. I have spread them around the house and we use them as intercoms as well as asking everyday questions. They are always good for a laugh or playing tunes through Pandora Radio. One of the things I like best is if you ask a question Alexa gives you the answer verbally. I also use Apples Siri but Siri says here is what I found on the web - meaning you have to stop what you are doing and read the answer - frustrating.,0
5,"Fun little toy
  
",17.May.19,Yes,"Having used Google home for a few months, I knew what I was getting myself into.  Long story short, I find amazon echo way more user friendly than Google.Pro :- I can setup different customized routines.- amazon prime music is already included with my prime. (Can't access amazon prime music on Google, obviously)- soft sides makes it look more fancy than Google's plastic sides. Personal preference.Cons :- Google's touch control for volume way more fun than echo.- have to setup individual accounts (I.e. calendar, email, text, etc.) Google was all integrated.",0
5,"Shouldn_ have waited so long!
  
",17.May.19,Yes,"I bought two of these to have in the bedrooms to use as a sound machine for my twins. It works perfectly! The ambient sounds loop throughout the night and I am able to use other functions such as the highlight to make it more versatile. Additionally, my daughter loves to use the hide and seek component and thinks it_ hilarious! I_ tempted to get another for the main living space. The only small issue is that it picks up my voice in the living room (small house) and will change things.",0
2,"You need subscriptions!
  
",17.May.19,Yes,"I got this product because I changed cable/internet providers and lost my access to SIRIUS XM radio.  The ads for ECHO Dot indicate I could get that service and ""Listen to all my favorite music"".  What they don't tell you is that you need a subscription to SIRIUS XM Radio, which is approx. $20 a month.  No where is any of the literature does it say that. I was annoyed and disappointed.  I returned it the very next day.  Also, in order for ALEXA to perform functions,you have to keep adding ""TASKS"" or apps for her to do what she is supposed to do.  Not pleased with the information on this product. I didn't own the product long enough to determine how good the product actually is.",0
4,"AI definitely needs significant improvement.  Speaker is ok
  
",17.May.19,Yes,"Amazon needs to do a lot of work on Alexa, let's get that right.  It often doesnt understand what I'm saying (or anyone else in the house), does the wrong thing, answers a totally different question, turns on and off by itself, and does not hold a charge if you unplug it.  However, they work decent enough for timers and controlling smart bulbs if you dont mind repeating yourself several times.  The speaker is also decent enough for an indoor room.",0
5,"Newest member of the family!! Love Alexa!!
  
",18.May.19,Yes,"One of the BEST gifts I ever bought for my Mom and Dad! My sister has the Apple Homepod, and when they brought it on vacation with us, my parents fell in love with it. For $260 something, plus the cost of an iTunes subscription, it's totally out of my league. Amazon has never steered me wrong yet, so I figured I'd try the Echo. TOTALLY AMAZING!! I didn't get the subscription to the full catalog of Amazon music yet, because they're have only been a few songs that we couldn't access without it! I'll probably end up signing up for it, because, unlike Apple, you don't have to take out a loan to pay for it. It's only $3.99 monthly. Seriously. SERIOUSLY!!Sometimes Alexa won't wake up to my dad's voice, but she does follow him the rest of the day. And whats hysterical, if you say her name, just in conversation, she stops what she's doing, and answers you. Doesn't matter if you're talking to her or not, she hears her name and tries to get involved. We're having a good time asking her questions and I like that sometimes she follows up with ""Did I answer your question"" and then sends the feedback. She seems able to answer a direct question, (""How many  years was Friends on TV?"") but not an open ended one, like  (""What was the TV show that had Mary Tyler Moore's legs and voice?""). I wish I could have sent feedback on that.",0
4,"I have six 6 through the house. I'm satisfied.
  
",18.May.19,Yes,"As noted in the title I have six devices plus smart plugs and bulbs set up through the house. The voice recognition is good for me, but it has trouble with my wife's voice for some reason unless she speaks slowly and directly at the Echo dots. The sound quality is good considering the size of the units, and after setting up all six as a house speaker system the surround sound is good. Every once in a while I'll hear Alexa talking in a room with nobody there, which is disconcerting, and at times the blue ring activates when nobody is talking, which also is weird. But other than the possible privacy issues I'm happy enough with them. Great intercom and emergency system, fun games available and I enjoy the music. I recommend the dive into the modern home.",0
5,"Aleksa, my new search engine
  
",18.May.19,Yes,"I have dry eye and it's so nice to say, hey Aleksa, what time is it? She is also my new alarm clock and kitchen timer. I crochet and she's gets me the high and low temperatures of the day for my temperature blanket and she helps my Canadian born husband spell, because he types slow and she had more patience than I do! When I go to bed at night, I say goodnight to her and she politely replies to sleep tight or pleasant dreams. I have one at work, one in my living room and one in my bedroom, Aleksa, where've your been  all my life!",0
5,"Cost Effective Entry Point to the Growing Alexa Ecosystem
  
",19.May.19,Yes,"If you_e on the fence about jumping into the growing Alexa ecosystem the Echo Dot is a great way to give it a whirl for a very small entry fee. This third generation version definitely sounds better than earlier versions, with a bit more bass for playing music. However, the extra bass muddies the Alexa voice quality a bit, in my humble opinion. Two recently added Echo features significantly improved their versatility for me: compatibility with Apple Music and the Alexa Guard feature. What_ not to like about a device that delivers so much for so little.",0
5,"Mom gives her approval!
  
",19.May.19,Yes,"Purchased this as part of a mother's day present. Who couldn't for merely $24? I have an Echo Show, and the setup on this little guy was easy. Simply open your Alexa App, setup and login and you're done! Capable of doing many things too. I managed to change my moms lighting to RGBs, and it really freaked her out when I made her living room turn red. Overall, great! Mom seems to like it and talks to Alexa like it's her daughter in law or something.",0
4,"It's a good looking addition to my room
  
",19.May.19,Yes,"Basically the same as the previous generations bu the fabric cover hides the microphones and make them less accurate than the models with the top mounted microphones. I actually think the 2nd genertion works better and actually sounds better. The physical size is a little larger but the older models produce better music &amp; voice. I don't think anything is actually better than the sales price, for, $29 it's a bargain.",0
2,"Great for kids, but it's useless for me as an adult.
  
",20.May.19,Yes,"I have owned an echo dot since December of 2017 and this one for over 6 months. Here is what I have experienced.Pros- games and stories for kids- alarms- apps to expand its capabilities- music if you pay for prime- it can answer a few questions- works great in the kitchenCons- it fails to answer 90% of basic questions- the alarm fails to sound every once in a while- it thinks you say it's name when you are talking to someone- it frequently glitches outIt is good with entertaining kids with stories, games, and jokes. You can use it as a timer when it feels like working. Every once in a while the timer alarm won't go off, but that's rare.Alexa is by far the dumbest voice assistant ever created. It's not meant to answer questions, it's better for entertainment. The alarm problem is a big issue, my fitbit is the backup because this fails so often. If I want it to play a song from my library I need to say artist and title or else it'll play something else. Some days it's not coherent and I need to unplug it, then plug it back in.I called Amazon about the issues, they say reset it and also unplug it. That only works for a couple of days. They don't care, it has issues and they are too blind to see their failure to make a good device. Both of my echo dots have issues, this one is the better of the two. Overall this was a waste money. Amazon had a good idea and they assigned a bunch of idiots to make their dream a reality, thanks Amazon.If you still want to buy this device I'll give you some tips. If you want it to stop glitching out unplug it for a minute once a week and reset it to factory condition once a month. It will touch out every once in a while, but not as much.",0
5,"Never Thought I_ Fall in Love Again!
  
",20.May.19,Yes,I love this thing! I can ask whatever I want to know in the middle of any conversation and get the information to prove I was right or wrong. Check the forecast without having to pick up my phone. Get my favorite programs on TV. She even farts!!! I am still learning everything about it and adding skills when I can. Setting alarms and reminders. It_ really a big help in getting your life together and keeping on top of things. I haven_ used the smart plug I bought to go with it yet. I have another Echo Dot coming to play music in stereo and plan on buying 2 of the bigger Echo units when I move and letting my roommate keep the two that are here because I think he_ really enjoying having the technology. Integrated with my Fire Stick 4K beautifully. But could not pair it with the voice remote that came with the Fire Stick. Wish they_ expand functions to also control TV volume/mute as well Blu-Ray and DVD players.,0
5,"Pleasantly surprised
  
",20.May.19,Yes,"It was easy to set up and integrated well with my other smart devices. I had just moved into a new house and was listening to Tom Petty, and asked it to change to another artist but paused after I said ""Alexa, play.."" it then said, ""here is a suggested playlist from Amazon music and started playing Bob Seger. It used the genre of music I had been listening too, and made suggestions from that. I really like it. I will probably use it more that I originally thought.I am going to sync it with my Ring doorbell, and my Smart TV as well. Pretty cool tech.",0
5,"East setup and really a useful addition to our home
  
",20.May.19,Yes,"I bought the Echo Dot for my husband. We set it up in a few minutes, and used it all weekend. We were impressed with how well the voice recognition worked, and how well Alexa dealt with all the demands we made. We have used a lot of the apps and found this to be really useful. The small size works great just about anywhere in our house or yard. We were able to plug into our larger speakers for great sound, but this was perfect for background music on the porch. We were totally surprised at how much we liked it. Looking forward to trying more features.",0
3,"Be careful on startup
  
",20.May.19,Yes,"I like the Alexa, but when I first got it, I tried to install it  using my HP computer. It had very little written instructions in the box. I went to  the website on the small amount of info given. Some how I got connected to what I thought was a customer service rep. It was really a scam who charged me $99.99 to install my Alexa. He said it would not download due to some internet problem, so he had to clean my internet. Thinking I was on line with Amazon, whom I have always trusted, I let it go too long and had to pay the money.",0
5,"Alexa is a must HAVE
  
",20.May.19,Yes,To be honest I wasn_ quite sure about having one but I decided to try and now I am so glad I did. Matter of fact I_ going to get two more for kitchen and living room. I love the way  she can interact plus I love being able to ask her to give me a Bible verse and even pray with me. I think this is awesome to start your day. I would highly recommend she can turn your TV on turn the lights on play music. She_ just like talking to anyone else she takes care of your needs.,0
4,"A good upgrade from last gen!
  
",20.May.19,Yes,"Better, louder sound quality than last gen.  If up too load Alexa can_ always here you from a distance but that is rare situation.  Miss usb connection though as now it takes up another outlet and the plug is big so not easy for certain wall plugs.  Overall, I bought two for stereo and that does work fine but not as good as a Bluetooth connection to an amp.  Might work good for a small office or room.  Good buy so far as I caught them on sale for $30.",0
5,"How did I ever get along without it?
  
",20.May.19,Yes,"This is the fifth Echo dot that I have purchased. I bought one and loved it so I bought two more and send so added two more with total of 5. Because they're so versatile and so able to provide Integrated Controls and things such as lights, thermostat Etc. I have a multi-level house and we'll use them as intercoms to talk between rooms and levels. The sound quality is great for listening to music. They become an integral part in our quality of life.",0
1,"Terrible sound quality - overwhelming distortion and static
  
",20.May.19,Yes,"Sound quality is beyond terrible. Cannot listen to music at all because of the interference. Even when Alexa is speaking, the sound is as if the voice is full of distortion or static. The poor sound quality issue started about 2 months after putting it into service. We stopped using it for a while, but then tried numerous resets - factory resets, restarts, changing the location so it was directly adjacent to the router, etc. - with no improvement. When I finally reviewed the crappy product, an Amazon employee contacted me to attempt to help. They could not. And now it's past warranty. Shocker. Terrible purchase",0
5,"Wherever you want to go, Alexa can take you there!
  
",21.May.19,Yes,"Alexa is great! I can ask her to play jazz. And she does! Then if a jazz musician starts singing, which few do well, I ask her, _lexa, play instrumental jazz only. And she does! Just now I asked her to play the Dave Brubeck Quartet. Great stuff! All this from, I think, Amazon music. But I_e also linked her with SiriusXM. Sirius tells me Alexa can bring me, all I have to do is ask, Howard Stern, talk radio, comedy, and sports in addition to many, many more music channels. But I_ willing to forego all that* and limit my requests to Sirius_ Real Jazz, Watercolors, and Symphony Hall channels. I_ listening to Brubeck on the Echo Dot speaker just now. And it_ just fine, curled up here by my elbow like a cat keeping warm in winter as I type this on my desktop. But should my country-music-loving spouse complain about the _oise, I can send Brubeck, MJQ, Miles, Stan Getz, Wes Montgomery and their many friends, both rowdy and cool, to my earphones, wired or Bluetooth.*For now. The possibilities are, apparently, as numerous as habitable planets in the universe. But much easier to get to. Thank you, Alexa!",0
4,"Great Sound Quality, Bluetooth Function Lacking
  
",21.May.19,Yes,"Has great sound and basic function. The Bluetooth integration with my Fire HD8 seems not to be possible. I cannot play music from the Fire HD8 over the Echo Dot. They will only allow my phone to connect to only one at a time. Bluetooth function still needs much improvement. For a device that is sophisticated, so should be its functionality. However, it does work flawlessly with iHeart Radio App. And I could create a paired group with two Echo Dots and they played in stereo. But, the paired group will not work with my phone(Another Bluetooth problem). Alexa App should be updated and upgraded to improve these Bluetooth limitations. The Drop-In Function is a little clunky needs improved. Gave 4 stars because it is still a work in progress!",0
5,"Excellent
  
",21.May.19,Yes,"We have three of these - one on each level of the house.  The voice recognition is great, the sound quality is excellent.  The ""intercom"" function is hands-free, and the sound is so good that it seems like the other person is in the room with you.  I'm not paranoid about the ""Alexa is always listening conspiracy issues"", but it IS listening - that's how it works.  It's not spying on you.  It's merely ready to give you a weather report, play some jazz, or add ketchup to your shopping list.  Excellent technology, as long as it's used properly.",0
5,"Pretty Good if you are an avid Amazon user
  
",21.May.19,Yes,"We wanted to test out Alexa vs Google. We have both an Alexa and Google Home. I definitely like Alexa for ordering things on Amazon or for Prime use. I dont ask it many questions because it cant answer them like how Google can. Alexa has a ton of features when using the Alexa App. Ive used Alexa to turn on my Xbox and to talk to Pikachu. I suggest the generation 3 since the speakers are around the product rather than on top. The sound comes out more easily.If you use Amazon Music or any of its products on the daily, then I would recommend an Alexa.If your looking for more answers to your search then get Google.Or if you're just a little bored and have some extra money to spend, then get both. Lol",0
5,"my 4th  DOT
  
",21.May.19,Yes,"Another DOT added to the network! Bought this one for outside in our Gazebo. I also purchased a 2 outlet SMART plug for outside use. This DOT set up in minutes to my existing products and network. Now I can easily turn on the lights and ceiling fan without messing around with plugs and extension cords. Using the Tp-Link KASA App,  I have set up the scheduling to turn the plug off at certain times in the evening in case I forget. I can also access these devices from ANYWHERE in the house and of course on my phone as well.  I LOVE these little toys!",0
4,"Small Device, Big Capability
  
",21.May.19,Yes,"Our family used an Echo previously, and given how well we were able to integrate its function into our daily routines, we opted to purchase an Echo dot.The only two issues, thus far, are, in order to play music on the dot (which we place in our bedroom), we needed to upgrade our Amazon music subscription for an additional $3 a month- a bit annoying to be nickeled and dimed, seeing as how we are already prime members (we pay for the prime membership), and payed an additional fee for the Amazon Music subscription.The other issue is that, the far field voice recognition isn_ consistent in hearing what you say to the device, depending on where it is placed- we had it on a nightstand, but the Dot failed to capture roughly 25% of what we said to it. After placing it higher up on the dresser, it has been far more consistent in detecting our voices and obeying commands, etc.Overall not a bad purchase, especially when Amazon has a sale on them.",0
3,"Great product, but not as expected to be...
  
",22.May.19,Yes,"I have 3 dots so far, and I like them, but have some cons.1. in our everyday life speech is short and simple, but Alexa has really long story, for example, if you ask for emblem noise more than one time, you'll always hear: welcome back to....bla bla bla... hmmmm... I'm not sure... we have a..... This is too much and too long. Answers must be as short as possible. Designers really need to work to increase speed for getting results, keep speech simple, remove repetitions, remove all these hmmm and not sure. It might be much more effective and productive without these stuff.2. When I want to have white noise, or ambient noise through whole night, very often it stop playing in 5 minutes, or in half an hour, or in couple hours. I understand, maybe something wrong was with WiFi, but I don't think it was the reason - another two dots were working without interruption at the time. But even if something happened, why after it's again online, it didn't go on playing?? Nobody told Alexa stop playing.3. No possibilities to control dots by Alexa app thru smartphone. It's weird. Really.I'll add more comments as they appear during usage.But for now, as conclusion, this is a raw product which had a lot of things must be improved, and I don't see any reason why they didn't do these improvements by 3rd!!!! generation... But anyway, this is good product, future product, ...still future.",0
1,"Problems with Bluetooth Connection to Best Buy Insignia Private Label Products.
  
",22.May.19,Yes,"For some reason the Echo Dot has problems hooking up to the Bluetooth on Best Buy's Private Label Line of Products ""Insignia"", I have the: Insignia Model NS-HAIOR18 Bluetooth Stereo System and the Insignia Bluetooth Bookshelf Speakers Model NS-HBTSS116. Not sure what the issue is with the Canadian Made Best Buy Private Label line and the Echo Dot, whereas I have no problem connecting Android and Apple Phones VIA Bluetooth to the Insignia Products.Very Frustrating indeed and if someone knows the issue Please Let Me Know. I could resolve it by buying Bluetooth Adapters that are compatible with the Echo Dot, but what a waist of money when both the products I have already have Bluetooth Built In?????",0
4,"Good quality speaker, bad user interface
  
",22.May.19,Yes,"The speaker in used as a Bluetooth speaker or just to ask Alexa basic questions is great. Also found a way to dig through the settings to manually pair my, and others, devices to her Bluetooth. The device is also very small and looks really good (I have mine in my office area and my boss never noticed for the first 2 weeks until someone else brought it up, and then he thoughts it was pretty cool). The sound quality is pretty good despite the form factor (Does best with highs and mids, but as long as it_ not a bass tester or something super heavy in bass it sounds really good even at max volume. I play mostly hip-hop, 60/70_ Psychedelic, and House/Deep House music and have had no complaints as far as sound quality. Plus it doesn_ rattle, even at max).That_ where the positive ends though.The app for the speaker is completely garbage and useless. The only thing on there is the backdoor to the settings so that once you manually pair the speaker to your device (and I highly recommend you do it this way, as speaking to her to do it is extremely tedious and frustrating), and the time and weather (which I can get off my phone or watch_ lock screen a lot easier). All of the in _kills (sub-apps) for music streams are junk and don_ work (most of the time won_ even boot, or if they do you have zero control over them) and it_ just a nightmare. You would think a trillion dollar company like Amazon, who_ trying to push these smart speakers into every home and office, would be able to come up with a simple and functional app with working _kills.Bottom line it_ a good Bluetooth speaker that can tell you your local weather or play a trivia game with you. If the app was fixed and 3rd party apps were better supported it would be a great speaker that I would buy for my home. But at this stage I_ still on the fence.",0
5,"Best gift to myself ever!
  
",22.May.19,Yes,"I had purchased 2 of these for my children for Christmas &amp; after hearing how much they loved it, I decided to purchase my own.  I love it! How did we ever live without it??? I keep mine in the kitchen &amp; when I walk in from work, I ask Alexa to play whoever I feel like listening to that day.  I have access to Amazon music &amp; my Apply music selections as well.  I love asking about the weather before heading out for the day.  Watching a morning news show is not always convenient for me.  I will most likely buy another to keep at the opposite end of my house.",0
2,"Still needs work it is not as seam less as lead to believe
  
",22.May.19,Yes,"This system, if it worked as it should is a 5 star device. The issue I have with it is that requires a TON of hand holding and trouble shooting. Integrations with other devices stop working for no apparent reason,  skills fail with zero explanation or error codes;  all requiring you to spend your valuable time to trouble shoot a device that is meant to save you time......yeah no. Iron this thing out more,  and stop using your paying customer base as testers to iron out issues as you go Amazon.",0
4,"Spanish language needs more tweeking
  
",22.May.19,Yes,"I bought it fot my mother who is forgetful thinking it would help stimulate her mind.We speak Spanish so I was so happy we could cortar that language.  However, the ""Spain"" Spanish is difficult to understand.And we really have to speak loud and directly at it for the ""Mexican"" Spanish to hear us which makes it frustrating to use.  Also, it doesn't seem to understand us either. So, basically it just sits thereNo as smooth as my English version.",0
5,"Alexia hates me &amp; we fight a lot!
  
",22.May.19,Yes,"I guess whe works fine I just think she doesn't like me.  Maybe it's a woman thing.It works great, just adapting to never having one so learning how to ""talk"" to a coded computer &amp; learn what she understands versus what or how we are asking her to do things is tricky. She does seem rather obstinate &amp; stubborn like the dreaded mother in law that doesn't listen when you tell her then kids need to go to bed kinda stuff.Can't compare to a 2nd generation other than it looks cooler.",0
1,"Blurry Sound
  
",23.May.19,Yes,"UPDATE: 08-05-2019. I've given up on this model. The sound is smeared or blurry. Maybe younger ears can make out what's being said. My wife's hearing is excellent and she can't understand anything it says. My hearing is fair and I find it difficult to make out the words. It's like the sounds are smeared or blurry. I don't know why this model was released to the public as it clearly isn't ready. And that's the only thing that IS clear about it. My friends have the taller model and it is easy to understand. So now I'm stuck with this DOT thing that I liked because of its size and price. I can't believe that this made it through an Amazon engineering review! Didn't anyone at Amazon try listening to this thing? You need to get a cross-section of the potential market to listen and evaluate its performance. Of course, this should have been done before I bought it. Your service sent out another unit, however, this is an inherent design flaw, not a one-off defect. The replacement was as blurry as the original.",0
5,"This Deal Is Better Than Sliced Peas
  
",23.May.19,Yes,"How can this thing be so fast? I ask. It answers immediately. I ask for a song, it plays the song right now. It_ kind of creepy. It_ still learning my voice, but so is my spouse who has been married to me for 27 years. The sound quality is good for a two inch disc, but it_ a two inch disc. I connected it wirelessly to my stereo. Now that_ nice. I asked it once for the weather. It didn_ answer, but I was on the subway between stations so I_ thinking of letting that one go this time. It turns on lights. It wishes me a nice weekend. It doesn_ cook...yet.",0
5,"Great sound.  Easy to get addicted to.
  
",23.May.19,Yes,"I can find out the time and weather before I get out of bed!  Alexa recognizes deep voices much better than higher voices, so if you are having problems with that, drop your voice.  Good with easy trivia (when did soandso die); but no substitute for internet searches ("" Umm, I don't know that one."" ).  Love listening to music.  Have this one and a 2nd generation one - the music quality is much better with the 3rd generation.  I also enjoy asking her to tell me a story when I go to bed - helps me get to sleep faster.  Wish she had more stories (getting repeats).",0
1,"frustrating
  
",23.May.19,Yes,"Like my first alexa, it did not take long for it to not understand commands that had been issued regularly without issue previously. As I alluded to, I have two Alexas - upstairs and downstairs. Often the units will play on the other one  repeatedly despite commands otherwise. SOOOOOOOO frustrating. Add to that the fact that employees listen to your alexa recordings. Just as easy to use my phone for music and podcasts and my kitchen timer - instead of the glorified timer that alexa is. I have used the tech dept for issues before and they were useless - they suggested I restart the unit - wow never thought of that.",0
5,"Love these
  
",23.May.19,Yes,I originally won one in a raffle at my jobs Christmas party so I got a smart bulb for it. After tinkering with it and using it for a while I liked it enough that I now have two of them. They work great for smart home integration. You can listen to music on them but honestly the sound quality is absolute garbage after about 40% volume. The speakers just distorts so much that you can_ enjoy the music. But as a smart home hub as well as personal assistant it works extremely well.,0
1,"Stopped working after 5 months. Warranty only 90 days.
  
",23.May.19,Yes,"We owned prior alexa devices so when the new generation came, we upgraded to the third generation. The sound quality is better than the 2nd generation echo dots. Looks more sleek. However, the device stopped working after 5 months. It wakes up to voice commands but then nothing happens. When we contacted Amazon customer service, they notified us that the warranty on the third generation is only 3 months as opposed to 1 year for the prior. They really should stand behind their products better.",0
5,"Great litttle device for entertainment and education
  
",24.May.19,Yes,"We bought 3 of these. I read that many reviewers complain about the sound quality. I cannot support those complaints. A friend of mine has the second generation, and I can clearly hear a HUGE difference in sound quality from the second to the third generation. The third gen has a nice base and fuller sounding quality. I understand that larger speakers might sound even better, louder, basier, and what have you, but let_ face it: this is a small device that is supposed to tell me the weather, remind me of things, set alarms for me, play oceans sounds when I want to fall asleep, and maybe play me an occasional Celine Dion song while I get ready in the morning. My daughter gets a kick out of having Alexa telling her jokes, playing 20 questions, or making farting sounds (I didn_ even know there was such a _kill). This is light entertainment, and additionally the dots function as our dictionary or Wiki. We love those little Echo dots. To prevent clutter and taking up counter or night stand space, I recommend looking into the Genie that fits those dots perfectly, tugs away the power cord and stays plugged into the outlet. Nice space saver. I highly recommend this little inexpensive Echo Dot, and for the record: I_ not being incentivized for my review.",0
5,"Best thing ever
  
",24.May.19,Yes,"I was gifted my first Echo Dot 3rd Gen for Mother's Day. It was very easy to set up and within mins I had Alexa ready to help me. I asked questions Alexa answered. I had her play my music (pandora was easy to set up on the phone app) she played it and the sound was great. The voice control works well until about 8 then it's hard for Alexa to here me so I have to get up or use the app to lower the volume so I don't have to scream at alexa. My 5yr old has used it to ask all sorts of questions. He now prefers alexas answers to moms. I lost my voice yesterday and alexa could still hear me. She told my kids it was time for bedtime routine and I didn't even have to speak (which was great since I had no voice &amp; a very sore throat) all I did was go to communication in my alexa app and tell alexa what to announce. I have learned something new every day since I got my first Echo Dot and when adding the last 3 I was not sure how it was going to work out, now I don't know how we went so long without Alexa in our home. From the morning routine I set in the app to the bedtime routine and answering 100 questions a day (mostly from my 5yr old) Alexa is quickly becoming a favorite around here.",0
5,"The Sound has Improved a LOT!
  
",24.May.19,Yes,"I had an earlier version that I disliked and returned. I knew it wasn't going to sound great, but thought it would still be okay for other uses and maybe for listening to news, podcasts or audiobooks. It was just annoying.This new 3rd Generation Dot, however, is a BIG improvement. Although I got it free as a promotion from another company I deal with, it is worth the $49 current price. It's not quite as full sounding as other Echo models, but by boosting the bass a little (using the Alexa app) it's not at all bad for casual listening in the kitchen or garage, for example.",0
5,"Already in like with Alexa!
  
",24.May.19,Yes,"I've only had her for a couple of weeks but the capabilities are going to be endless. No more going to my phone to type in my question to google.  I've found that re-wording questions can make a difference in the answer which is helpful if the first answer is not an answer (doesn't know).  I can see making my routine ""smart"" and it will be amazing.",1
5,"Alexa in a Mini
  
",24.May.19,Yes,"Works a lot like the first Echo I bought way back when it first came out--with a price tag of about $200 but on sale for $100. Got this one on sale for about $20. Does a lot more than the first one (which is still in service) but in a much more compact version. Love being able to call people with it. Love getting the news and weather. And love the blinking yellow ring that tells me she has news from Amazon for me! Alexa, what's the notification? You have a shipment from Amazon shopping coming today!!",0
2,"Not great
  
",24.May.19,Yes,"The echo dot is okay, but setting up the wireless on the app is hard. You really have to search to get to where you can enter your wifi password so it will take. When setting it up it would say you are connected when you actually are not. The sound quality is not good.  It will not connect to peripherals except another echo. I would not have kept it but it was a free promotion from a sirrusxm subscription.",0
3,"Some real interesting conversations with this
  
",25.May.19,Yes,"I like my Alexa, but I sure hope it improves. I have a Living room fan which gets used almost every day, I will tell Alexa ""Living Room Fan on"" to which she replies, ""I can not find a device named Living Room Heater"" and we are off I try several more times and unless I speak very slowly just a few inches away she just does not get it. Alexa does not have that issue with the living room lamp or the living room door, how does she confuse FAN with HEATER?I will just make a couple of points I can keep going a while. I like playing music via Alexa, but if you try to give a command while she is playing music, bring our your inner drill instructor, because she will never respond unless you get close and yell or press the button on top to shut her up.I like it and hope she gets better, meanwhile our give and take when she gets it wrong would make for good Abbot and Costello fodder.",0
5,"Great upgrade from last echo not sure ok alexa echo-system lately .
  
",25.May.19,Yes,So I_ way to committed to alexa at this point we have 5 speakers including a show and spot. This is a big sound upgrade compared to the last dot generation perfect for bathroom . We are starting to regret committing this much to alexa . She seems to struggle hearing us sometimes . One of our dogs names is Baxter and I would say 20% of the time we yell his name out alexa goes off that_ about a 10% better response rate than Baxter .i was hoping more apps could be added to the show for instance we cook with platejoy recipes and we need to have our laptop in the kitchen it_ a shame with the show sitting right there however that_ more of a knock on the show. So yeah device is great just before you decide to fill a house with them think through what you want to accomplish .,0
4,"Better speakers
  
",25.May.19,Yes,"Much better speakers than the previous generation. I don_ use the Bluetooth speaker in the baby_ room anymore. However, seems like Alexa doesn_ hear me as well as the older version. Not a deal breaker. You won_ need to buy an additional cover anymore and honestly, it was ridiculous they charged $10 for those. If you can afford it no problem then upgrade. If you cannot, don_ worry, you_e not missing out_specially if you already have nice Bluetooth speakers hooked up.",0

",25.May.19,Yes,"I fell on the kitchen floor when my husband was in the hospital and I was alone.  The phone was 20 feet away and my cell phone was in my purse in the bedroom!!  Thank goodness I was not badly hurt, but it scared me.  I am only 68 and I refuse to wear one of those ""things"" around my neck!  I got 3 echo dots (3rd gen) , one for each part of the house.  I can say "" call jack"" or ""call mary"" and speak from the floor to a friend who can come and help me or call 911.  I don't feel so alone now!!",0
5,"Love my Alexa!!
  
",25.May.19,Yes,"I am in love with Alexa ask to sing, play song and do so many stuff like call.Alexa itself could describe what are it capabilities which I got to know through amazon email. The best thing I like is to create shopping list and even we can categorize based on store.Handy and nice sound quality, good range and can pick up from long range. This is my first echo dot product and I wish I had tried much before. Overall nice product to be in home.",0

",25.May.19,Yes,Dose what they said it would . Had a friend set it up easy  for him to do he used his smart phone .Very happy with it . Love i can get any kind of muice I want . She plays my local raido staions .comes in crystal clear.One of the reasons i bought Aleax  was in the past i had bought 3 raidos they came in terriable as i live in a mobile home .Have played her just about every day .I also  ask her the weather. Hope that can help .,0
2,"Worked for five months, then problems probably related to internet speed...
  
",26.May.19,Yes,"My echo dot started having issues after about five months of trouble-free music streaming. It would apparently lose the internet connection because Alexa would respond with, __ sorry, I_ having a hard time understanding right now. It also would skip while music was playing.Amazon honored their replacement policy for this item (even though they argued with me that there wasn_ one so I had to provide a screen shot of my order), but the new one is doing the same thing. I let them know.I use satellite internet which is faster than DHL at 15.3 Mbps, but nowhere near Comcast with their 60 to 150 Mbps. So it appears that there was a tweak to the system that makes Alexa require faster speeds or perhaps, a faster ping than we get using satellite? Hard to say. But, if you use HughesNet or Exede, you might have the same problems that we_e experiencing.UPDATE: still undependable, but I also have no problem streaming on my iMac or my iPhone or iPad. The echo cot apparently doesn't do well with getting a clear signal consistently. It's fun when it works.",0
4,"Nice
  
",26.May.19,Yes,"I can't get the app to work on my cell phone, but it plays music and the alarm works great. Too easy to say Alexa snooze to many times. I like that I can change the length of the snooz. not many alarm clocks can do that.  I would like to have it set music to the alarm.",1
5,"Got This For My 86 Year Old Grandmother
  
",27.May.19,Yes,"My grandfather died a few years ago and my grandmother is now in an assisted living facility.We were trying to figure out what to get her for Christmas which is tough since her room is fairly small and really what do you get someone in their 80's?Well, this Echo Dot was on sale and we thought maybe we could program it with all of her kid's and grandkid's birthdays and install some bible stuff on it for her.  We also thought maybe it would give her someone to talk to and pass the time if she could figure out how to use it.  She's not a big computer or smart phone fan but figured what the heck, if she doesn't like it we'll give it to one of the kids lol.I did install a daily bible verse app and everyone's birthdays along with some other custom routines for her so every morning it goes through birthday reminders and reads her daily bible verse.I also printed out a sheet of common things to ask it so she could get started.It started off a little rough when we first gave it to her, I did program it to say it was a Christian if you ask it what religion it is but I did tell her not to baptize it as the little woman named Alexa that lives inside it would die.She had a hard time with calling it Alexa at first, she kept wanting to call her Alexis and then would get frustrated that it wouldn't listen to her.I also had to explain to her that she couldn't really have a full conversation with her and that she had to stick to simple commands.  She initially would say stuff like ""Alexis, this is Esther"" so Alexa would just say ""hmm, I'm not sure about that"" so she would respond ""well I am"".I figured if nothing else at least it would go through the every morning routine with her even if she couldn't get the hang of asking it things.The staff at the assisted living facility found out she had this and they started playing with it.  I got a Spotify subscription for it so she could listen to music if she wanted but I figured I'd probably just end up cancelling it since I doubted she would use it.  Turns out that's now what she uses it for the most.  One of the nurses started asking it to play old Roger Miller songs when she came in to give her pills and my grandma thought that was pretty cool.Now anytime someone goes to visit her she tells them all about her Alexis.  It was probably the best gift we could have gotten her for Christmas lol.",1
5,"Great for immobile persons. Entertaining and helpful.
  
",27.May.19,Yes,"Set this Echo Dot up for immobile person confined mostly to bed and used to ask questions play music. Great for elderly. I can use Alexa from my cellphone App to speak to person with the drop in feature (can also ""call"" from the app). The Alex with the built in speaker can be used to make phone calls in the USA and you make a phone contact list and then ask it to ""Alexa Call Pat"" and it can dial them on their phone (the receiving party  does not need the App to receive calls, just a phone it landline).It can even read email, and respond with your voice( haven't used the latter to reply).The Alexa voice that plays is clear but IMO speaks a little fast and the pitch is a little high for someone that might have hearing issues. Hope Amazon offers more Alexa it Alex voices in future.You get the feeling that Big Brother is always listening, yes her name is Alexa.You can ""mute"" the microphone, hmmm.",0
4,"Great addition for any smart home.
  
",27.May.19,Yes,"I'm using Alexa to integrate all of my smart devices / smart hub to voice control and timed schedules. The gen 3 echo devices provide greater audio feedback and is much more asthetically pleasing to the 2nd gen echos. My only real issue with these 3rd gen devices is that voice command catching is still sub par. If you have an echo under a TV or other audio playing device, even those linked to your Alexa network, the echo will have a hard time listening to commands. This might be something they can fix with better software implementations via more developed noise filters, but currently this is a consistent minor issue.Overall, this is a definite upgrade from previous generation echo devices, and is now comparable to Google home systems.",0
3,"This would easily be 5 stars if I could fix my one issue
  
",27.May.19,Yes,"I have an Amazon Echo in my kitchen and three other echo dots in other rooms of the house. I have two amazon smart plugs. The echo dots will not recognize the smart plugs no matter what I do. I have to go into the kitchen to tell them to turn on. This is literally my only complaint and would be happy to change this review to 5 stars if someone can tell me how to fix this. When I go into the app and click on all devices, all 6 devices show up but only the Echo will recognize it when you ask it to turn on. Other than that, having the ability to make lists, turn on music, turn on lights, ask general questions without having to touch anything is fantastic. It saves so much time and truly is like you have your own personal assistant. Couldn_ go back to not having them.",0
2,"Can't get this blasted think to work
  
",27.May.19,Yes,"I have wasted countless hours trying to get this thing to work, It is really cute and occasional says something to me. I have tried to find a way to run it with my Mac Pro and was unable to do anything. When I try to download an app it wants my amazon account sign in but I am not sure if they mean the same one I go shopping with, anyway, it never accepts my password so I set up a new account with a different email and downloaded apps to an older Android phone but they won't complete the setup. I don't think Alexa likes Apple and does not want to play with the iPhone, I am getting so frustrated I am about to throw this Dot in the river and listen for the Echo.",0
5,"Alexa is my bestie!
  
",27.May.19,Yes,"Where have these amazing little dots been all of my life? How have I functioned prior to them entering my home? Siri who?Obviously, I love them. My family loves them, too. We can all listen to whatever interests us and it_ cut out the need for kids to have devices in bedrooms. We often do audible, music, or rain sounds at night _. I won_ go into every reason that they_e awesome, but do yourself a favor and take time to familiarize yourself with everything these things can do. There_ so much and if you don_ educate yourself, you_l miss out.",0
5,"Changed recognition name
  
",27.May.19,Yes,"First thing that I did was change the recognition word from Alexa. Otherwise you are watching a YouTube video about Echo and they start saying Alexa and you echo starts responding. I was surprised at how good the voice recognition is, there is only occasional times when it doesn't recognize what I am saying. It seems to have problems with letters more so than words. When I want to listen to a radio station and say the call sign letters it often gets the wrong one. But for controlling things around the housing and asking questions it is very good and interpreting my speech.",0
5,"My new friend Alexa
  
",28.May.19,Yes,"Alexa was a gift from my daughter. It is something I wouldn_ have bought myself, but now that she_ here I do kind of like her doing things for me. I like the lights turning on and off. I like she can turn on my fans. I haven_ played music in years and now I can fill my afternoons with the music of my choice instead of annoying television shows. Alexa also helps remind me to take my medication. I haven_ put Alexa to the test of doing a lot of other things, but I_ just getting to know her. I find it funny I tell her Thank You after she accomplishes her tasks!",0
4,"Like HAL in 2001
  
",28.May.19,Yes,Using it to play music from Amazon music with a Echo Sub and two gen 3s. The sound is great and it's fun but it often makes mistakes and clearly changes what I ask for. I cant trust it to work properly all the time so I'm not buying more devices until Amazon programs it to be smarter. I recommend it for fun but I recommend you have patience. It often reminds me of HAL the talking computer in 2001. So polite and ... well I warned you.,0
2,"Speakers--WOW! (Revised to UGH!)
  
",29.May.19,Yes,"Update:I wish I had never upgraded to the latest (3rd) generation! The device drives me crazy. I constantly have to yell at it to get any response, and that's after they replaced the original, so evidently it's not just a flaw in a particular device. The old 2nd generation on the opposite end of the house on a different floor hears and responds before the one I'm standing beside. Sometimes, she will initially respond (after some yelling), like when I tell her to stop the music, but then when I walk away, it starts again. Sometimes the blue light will spin and she may even say ""okay"" but then not follow the command. It's like Siri (dumb) with attitude. The improved speakers are not worth the aggravation. I'm sure my neighbors don't appreciate the yelling either. I'd give it 0 stars, but it does have much better speakers and I loved the 2nd generation. This one is a lot of frustration.Original Review: I was skeptical about replacing a working prior generation, but WOW--the speakers in this version are SOOO MUCH BETTER! I actually heard it the other day with it in my bedroom upstairs and me in the car, all windows closed! The only problem is that I often have to yell at it repeatedly to get it ""to pay attention to me."" (That's why it was on while I was in the car--it had not turned off when I told it to do so.) This isn't just when it's at maximum volume, wasn't an issue with the last version, and I have a very loud, strong voice. Sometimes, she doesn't understand basic questions, even about Amazon topics, but her comprehension is far superior to Siri. Changes I'd like to see that could be pushed in firmware include being able to change the name to whatever I want and having a male voice.",1
5,"WE LOVE OUR ALEXA
  
",29.May.19,Yes,"If you're like me, you never think to turn on music until *after* you're elbow deep in dirty dish water. Alexa has my back. If you're like my husband, you want to hear your news while making coffee. Alexa starts our day. When we have friends over and want to question the validity of any factoid in the universe, Alexa is right there, putting strain on our friendships with her hit-or-miss knowledge. She tells our robot vacuum when to harass the cats, she keeps the delivery guy in check with our completely unimportant parcels, and she effortlessly redirects me to the app for half the things I ask her to do. She's just like any other member of the family.  And we love her.",0
1,"Started beeping and wouldn't respond to any request to shut off
  
",29.May.19,Yes,"I got this Echo Dot thinking that I needed it to control an Amazon smart plug.  It turned out that the Dot was not really needed, as I can turn the smart plug on and off from the Alexa app.  Although integration with the Dot started out smoothly and the Dot was cute to talk to for weather and music, when the Dot offered to turn on my smart plug for a timed interval, I tried it out.  Unfortunately, when it got to the end of the interval, it started beeping and saying Interval is done.  Nothing I could try would make it stop beeping.  I tried saying, ""Alexa, stop"" and ""Alexa, mute"" and ""Alexa, shut up"" but it just kept on going.  I thought maybe it would get tired and quiet down on its own, but no such luck.  So I unplugged it and enjoyed the peace and quiet.  By then I realized I had spent $50 on something that had some design flaws, so i returned it.",0
5,"Perfect upgrade!
  
",29.May.19,Yes,"I received 2 of the 3rd gen's after purchasing some Ring products, I already had 3 of the 2nd gen's so I replaced them.  This sounds so much better and the voice recognition is definitely better.  Amazon is heading in the right direction with this and it makes my home automation so much better.  I have Hue, Ring, and Nest products, as well as some smart switches so having Alexa do the work when I am too lazy to pull out my phone is great.  Setting this generation up is a breeze compared to the last 2, it's not like they were difficult by any means but this is just so much more efficient.",0
2,"good for a while
  
",29.May.19,Yes,"We use all 3 of our dots for music, nothing crazy, thats what my Klipsch subs are for. Anyway, all 3 have developed a tingy sound with the mid and high notes, a clear sign of a blown voice coil. Normal use at 50% or less volume, Im sure Amazon can verify that with how much detail is stored within the dot. Anyway, we bought small computer speakers to plug in so the dots speakers are no longer used.Alexa itself is pretty solid for basic and mid level instruction, like adding things to a shopping list or setting a timer.",0
2,"Sounds great, software has taken a huge step back from generation one
  
",29.May.19,Yes,"The sound is so good that it comes close to the Echo units. The 1st and 2nd generation Echo dots are laughable awful sounding compared to this generation. When the previous models came out, you were able to upload a few songs but now the only way is to have a prime account directly attached. This unit is on an account that is under a prime account but does not have access to same features. So I am stuck with the few songs that have been purchased through amazon and then Pandora or other streaming services.",0

However, I did buy several (3) at Christmas, and one of them is defective. My son has it almost all the way up, and he can hear me great at first, but then my voice fades all the way out. I am upset about that one. This o e I purchased for work. I plug it in a lot and unuf because I work for an attorney office, and confidentially is our number one concern.",0
5,"So far I'm really liking this little smart speaker
  
",29.May.19,Yes,"Alexa doesn't know how to respond to every command you can think of yet but does a great job at what it knows.  The speaker quality is great for the price and voice recognition is great, it almost always knows what I'm saying even when there is other background noise in the room.  So far I've added a smart plug and I've bought a smartthings hub as well.  I plan to add additional lights to my smart home in progress.",0

",30.May.19,Yes,"I'm a senior and something of a Luddite. I use my smart phone as little as possible, and I enjoy being able to preserve skills like reading a map or remembering a number.  But I'm enchanted by this little device.  I love Pandora radio, and the Echo gives me all the features of Grace receiver with the convenience of oral commands.  I can sync it to the set in my living room or use it by itself in the bedroom. It will give me weather on demand and update the news for me as well.  The sound and convenience are so great that I can ignore that it's actually a spying device that can record virtually everything  I do.",0

",30.May.19,Yes,"I was really surprised how easy it was to install with my current Amazon/Fire TV/Ring SetupI installed it to use with my Ring Doorbell 2 as an extra doorbell notification in my office at home.  Not only does it ring an extended chime (several to choose from) but it also verbally says ""Someone is at your door.""Plus, I have all the other benefits that come with it, like playing music, etc., and the sound is great.",0
4,"Feeling represented in the Market Place
  
",31.May.19,Yes,"The 3rd generation is much better than the 2nd generation which literary would have me arguing and losing my temper when it seemed to have a mind of its own or none at all. I guess now I know it was probably the live person listen and responding to my questions with random answers. I sometimes get that when talking with live Amazon reps. Nevertheless the 3rd generation(cats out of the bag) interacts as I would expect a voice operated computer to. It hasn't lost Wi-Fi connection 50 times a day like the gen 2 almost always did and I don't have to alter my speech/slang for it to understand me. Although it would be nice to have a voice that feels more authentic and maybe even ethnic. I would love to hear Shantae or Esther, maybe even Kenya tell me facts about the underground railroad instead of Alexa saying "" I'm sorry, I dont have the answer to that.""",0

Im so used to it that sometimes I'll be somewhere else and start to ask alexa to do something and realize I can't because there's just an old radio. The only thing is my sister has a friend named echo and I've got a friend named alexa. Conversations where they come up (right now it's back to alexa) either end up with a confused echo dot or a response to a question we didn't ask, which is always hilarious.",0
4,"still unsure about the Echo Dot
  
",31.May.19,Yes,"First it took 9 days to arrive even though it is a prime item.  Did an online chat regarding this and she said it was out of stock at the local amazon warehouse.  With that being said after it was shipped it still took 5 days and everything about this order said 2 day shipping.  I was also suppose to get a $15 credit and that never happened.On to the product itself, it was relatively easy to set up, however I did have an issue initially.  I got it set up and I love it, after about a month the speaker started to have static in the sound.  I turned it off because it didn't go away then turned it back on the next day and it played fine for the hour I was listening to it.  I hope it was a fre.  ak thing and continues to play well.  Still disapointed with Amazon customer service.",0
4,"Works almost as intended
  
",1.Jun.19,Yes,"Overall these are pretty good devices. They don't drop wifi connection like Amazon's smartplugs do and generally can do what is requested. That said the voice recognition is sub-par to Googles. If you've ever done something ""custom"" like make a shopping list you'll be amused by the interesting (but similar) things it puts in there that are only similar in sound to what you said. I also once set up a lamp and it asked for a name so I said lamp, it named it lamb. Things like that. That said by varying the names of your devices it is built to ""guess"" what you meant and generally works correctly even if its extremely clear at this point to me these things don't hear all that great.",0
3,"Works as expected but just a tiring toy after about a week.
  
",1.Jun.19,Yes,"We bought this since it seemed to be new technology that we should learn about - we connected a couple of lights to it, and occasionally ask it to play music or answer a question.  Its kind of neat, but after a while found it more work/effort to use than just turn on/off the lights are self.  Since we have Siri (iPhone) there really isn't anything the DOT does better or different.  I'm glad I bought it but like most things it just sits silently barely used now.",0
1,"Not like the original
  
",1.Jun.19,Yes,I had a first gen echo that was great and my son loved it. I thought I_ exchange it for this smaller version that looked nicer in his room. This doesn_ play ANYTHING she doesn_ recognize anything he says . It won_ play music . I have everything hooked up correctly on my amazon app. I also have an echo show that_ pretty flawless.

4,"Nice, but I like the 2nd generation version better
  
",2.Jun.19,Yes,"The 3rd generation Echo certainly has better sound than the 2nd, but it's too bassy for me and the audio controls (tone adjustments) don't seem to have any effect.  But worse, it doesn't have as many, or as good, microphones.  I can be in the same room with it and ask a question, and the 2nd generation echo in the next room will answer instead of the one beside me!  It obviously hears me because the ring lights up, but apparently the one in the other room hears me better.Amazon seems to have done the same thing that every other manufacturer does - they took something that was awesome and broke it by trying to improve it.But I still love my Alexa!",0
1,"Horrible customer service and product
  
",2.Jun.19,Yes,"Horrible device and customer service when trying to get a new one. I bought two at one time. One sounded good the other was clearly defective and the speaker rattled. I was on chat with customer service for over 1 1/2 hrs. Finally got on the phone with a supervisor. My prime account was suspended one month early and was sent another defective unit that sounded worse than the defective unit I already had. So I had to pay to re-active my prime account, and contact customer service again for another replacement. Worst customer service ever!!! I was placed on hold, told I couldn_ get a replacement. When I have another 2 hrs to waste I suppose I_l call back again. Lesson learned, I won_ be purchasing any Amazon product again.",0

",2.Jun.19,Yes,"I am really glad I purchased this product.  This small little thing gives out great sound and is a pleasure to listen to.

With all of that being said, one of my dots just shows a red light and totally stopped working randomly. No damage to it whatsoever. I Called customer service to trouble shoot which they did and when they told me that they couldn't find an issue with the product, I asked what my options were. she informed me that there was nothing that they could offer because it was outside of their 90 warranty period. BUT she told me she would make me a special offer of 15% off of a new echo product if I wanted to buy another one. NO THANKS! Its a shame that a loyal customer was lost over this.

I would put it on par with Anker or  any of those mid range blutooth speakers - you can still pair or hard line direction to speaker but the Gen 3s don't even need it .  I have 3 in the house in a music group and one gen 2 and when you walk in the room with the Gen 2 its like night and day when they are playing.,0
5,"Echo Dot
  
",4.Jun.19,Yes,"I love this little thing, I was expecting to have to buy a bluetooth speaker because I thought the sound would be extremely low but I was so wrong.  The sound is very good and I was able to tune into my favorite radio station.  I purchased the echo connect to be able to make calls when I need to because I'm disabled and sometimes I fall so its great to be able to tell Alexa to call someone if I need help. :)",1
5,"Be careful not to use any Alexa app on Yahoo or other wbsite.
  
",4.Jun.19,Yes,I downloaded the Alexa app for android on Yahoo. I was prompted that the Alexa Echo Dot will guide me thru. That man took over my mouse and my computer. He then pressured me to pay $299.00 for 2 yrs to remove the virus he put in my computer.I sent both Echo Dots back for over a week. Still no refunds from Amazon Prime. I have been a Prime member for over 9 years hence I cancelled  my Prime membership. This is not away to treat a loyal customer.,0
5,"It_ worth more than every penny you spend on it!
  
",5.Jun.19,Yes,"I love my Alexa! I mostly use it to play games with. My favorite games are Escape Room, Escape The Airplane, Dungeon Adventures, Price Tag, Song Quiz, The Magic Door (there_ an overall adventure so you should get online and look it up after you play it the first time), Jack Ryan November Morning, and The Vortex. I also have Apple Music. It_ totally worth buying Apple Music because you can play any song your heart desires. You can create playlists and then ask Alexa to shuffle or play your _hatever you named your playlist playlist. I also ask Alexa for the weather report every day. You can also say, _lexa, what will the temperature be at 10am? Or _hat_ the forecast for Saturday? I can also have Alexa turn on my Fire TV and tell it to bring up a specific show or genre or have Alexa turn the TV off. You can also buy devices to turn lights on and off. There is so much more you can do and the device is so cheap you can_ get something so cheap that has so much to offer.",0
4,"Improvement over Gen 2
  
",5.Jun.19,Yes,"Got this for free with a Ring Doorbell.  It is a large improvement over my Gen 2 dot. Sound is very good for such a small device.  Very acceptable for streaming music while I work. Seems to pick up commands better than the Gen 2 does, but it is in a smaller room, so that might make a difference. Still misunderstands more than I would like. I really like the heavier design and rubberized base.  It stays were I put it.  Much more attractive than the gen 2.  WiFi is improved over the Gen 2 as well. It connects to 802.11 AC while the Gen 2 only connects to N which is great as I'm trying to reduce/eliminate all Non-AC devices.  If I get a chance to pick up more Gen 3 dots, I'll replace my Gen 2 dot and Gen 1 Echo.  This device is nice enough, that I'm not sure why I would want a new Echo.  It sounds good, is compact, looks good, and blends into the environment.  If I want better sound for music, I'll turn on my receiver.",0
5,"Fantabulous
  
",5.Jun.19,Yes,"This has made Alexa literallyMy 7-year-olds best friend. She tells her she loves her and plays guessing games for minutes at a time (she_ 7 so that_ all the attention she_ got lol). She adores having her own bedtime routine _lexa, Goodnight and the ability to play _aby Shark on demand. I use Alexa to bring the kids down for dinner or relay other reminders even from work: _om is leaving in ten minutes-are your rooms clean?  It_ absolutely work every penny. I almost bought one for every room in the house (not kidding)",0

5,"Great Device, you can't go wrong!
  
",6.Jun.19,Yes,"To start with, I have had conversations with my wife about this technology and thought ""why would we ever have a need for this thing"" ... So I never bought one. Then we really wanted a Ring door bell and the first echo dot was bundled with... Needless to say, we now have three dots and found them so intuitive and fun I can't imagine how we got along without them. Truly amazing. I am contemplating getting the show 5 next to replace my alarm clock! There are so many more ""skills"" Alexa can do than we task her with but it's awesome... Yes these are exciting times we live in if you stop and think about it...",0
3,"UPDATED
  
",6.Jun.19,Yes,"UPDATE:Added two stars because I decided to CALL Amazon Customer Service. After talking to a live person, doing the same tests with them that the representative on the instant chat told me to do, they decided to send a replacement. So far no issues with the replacement. Still leaving off two stars for the horrible customer service experience with the instant chat.Original Review:Have to give 1 star because it worked for about two weeks. Then one day, my WiFi went out. My internet provider fixed the WiFi, and now the device won_ reconnect to my network. I have tried everything - unplugging it, hard reset, forgetting my network, deregistering it from my account, and talking to customer service. I_ actually writing this review as I am waiting for the customer service rep to respond to my _nstant chat message (it_ been over 10 minutes now). Customer service has been about as useless as this device is without WiFi.",0
5,"Loving having Alexa in my home!
  
",6.Jun.19,Yes,"It is lovely to have her put on my playlists from Spotify and Pandora as well as seeking out certain artists when I'm in a mood for something else. I love having a Smart Plug and will get more of them now that I see how easy the integration was. The integration with my Roku, however, has not been as simple. The app shows it's enabled but Alexa doesn't recognize it yet. I'm still working on that. Alexa makes me laugh sometimes with her funny responses. I'm just now learning some specific phrase for her and I bet it will be even more fun soon.",0
5,"I love my Echo Dot
  
",6.Jun.19,Yes,"I like being able to accomplish tasks with voice commands. My first Echo Dot was a freebie from my SiriusXm renewal.  I quickly discovered that having just one Alexa wasn_ enough. I also realized that moving one Echo Dot from room to room was quite efficient and most annoying. Within two weeks I have subsequently purchased four additional units so that I have one in each of the rooms that I frequent. There_ one in the kitchen, my office, my exercise room, my bedroom, and the basement.  I have purchased a smart plug and a smart bulb and plan to add more accessories to my Echo Dot units. I am particularly fond of the one in my bedroom which turns on the light and the radio in the morning when I say good morning Alexa. Because I am a sci-fi buff I grew up on Star Trek, and being able to talk to the computer and perform various tasks is something that I always thought was way cool. I love my Echo dots and I_ having a ball using them.",0
2,"I've gone through 2 in 6 months
  
",6.Jun.19,Yes,I know it wasn't expensive but GEEZ! Initially purchased in January 2019. Worked great until April then would not connect to network. I was sent a replacement. That too worked great until Mid may when it too stopped working on the internet. I got the first replacement for free but they back date the warranty on it to the original purchase so I was screwed for another replacement.The Amazon rep did what he could. Gave me 20% off and I purchased the Plus instead. I have already 1 Plus since March. We see how long they last.,0
1,"Room for improvement
  
",6.Jun.19,Yes,"I was about to buy two more but during use i realise that the.voice recognition is not that great you tell her one thing it does the other , and if you set the volume to higher than 8. Then it is unable to hear you so you_l have to either shout or press the botton for it to hear you.Sound is great mainly i use it as an alarm and some ambient music that_ it otherwise not that great",0
4,"Makes life easier
  
",7.Jun.19,Yes,"I'm really enjoying my Echo Dot Smart Speaker with Alexa. I am truly amazed at what all you can do with this device. The first night I hooked it up, I was able to get her to recognize my voice out of a group of people. Now I only bought myself one, but if you buy multiples, you are supposed to be able to link them and you can use them sort of like an intercom system to talk to people in another room. You can also do things like have her to make a shopping list, look things up online, play playlists or the thing that really blew my mind....play games!! Yes she will play games with you! You can choose from kids games, adult games, family games, single player, multiplayer, game show games... the list goes on and on! This entertained my older kids for the longest! I even tried it out myself and had a blast. There are still so many things I have yet to try, but I'm already impressed. Now, a few things I wasn't so impressed with is the fact that its not rechargeable. You can unplug it and take to another room with you. Also, there are things you try to ask Alexa to look up, and you have to ask several different ways before she knows how to get an answer for you. Then, there are times you have to get pretty close and loud for her to hear you, but other times, not so much. Those are really the only things I have complaints about. I would still buy this again in a heartbeat. As a matter of fact, I bought two extras to give as gifts.",0
5,"Better than I expected...
  
",7.Jun.19,Yes,"I was able to pick up the echo dot at a great price, because my wife subscribes to Amazon Music Unlimited. I got it at basically half price so I picked up multiple dots initially to use as intercoms for my teen kids since they are usually locked in their bedrooms usually deep into some video game.  I don_ know why I hesitated so long. The sound quality is great especially for such a small device whether steaming Amazon music or connected by Bluetooth to my iPhone. And I was easily able to integrate all the other smart devices (WiFi enabled led bulbs, smart switches, etc) in my home to one activation source (in reality to multiple activation sources). I_e created some simple _outines like announcing it_ time to wake up and play the current weather report to specific devices or telling my the traffic situation to work. It_ just amazing the things you can do with this device.",0
4,"very nice except when playing mostly unable to hear your voice
  
",7.Jun.19,Yes,"We all love Alexa, we use it mostly to control external devices and for that it works very well.Sometimes my kid and wife use it to stream music and we found out that even with not very loud music playing Alexa has some problems hearing your voice when you first call it to interact, most of the times you need to go really close to make it hear your voice before it turns the music down in response of your call.I don't know if there is a technical way to overcome the issue, if not maybe having speaker and voice recognition in the same device might not be a great idea.",0
5,"Fantastic!
  
",7.Jun.19,Yes,"Love love love this.  I have an Amazon Echo and love it - got this for my mum who has early stage dementia and is in a care facility. I thought she would enjoy being able to play music _lexa play the Beatles, Josh groban, The Beach Boys or check the date, weather, news... or hear a joke, or whatever, without having to touch a button.  Well does she ever. The best surprise was when i used the drop in function from the app and was able to speak with her while she was in bed, hands free, no phone, no cord, no buttons - it_ fantastic and it  sounds great. Nurses love coming to help her so they too can talk with Alexa. Brilliant little device for a tiny amount of money. (Great sale, tyvm Amazon.)",0
3,"Beware of Smart Home Password Woes
  
",7.Jun.19,Yes,"I started with the Echo Dot and found thought I was discovering a hands free future.  But it turns out to be a bit of a nightmare. Since that first echo dot I bought dozens of Alexa compatible devices, dots, spots, looks, door bells, thermostats, callers, clocks, sous vide, speakers etc. All was fine until, for security purposes, I had to change my WiFi password.  Everyone of my devices immediately turned into electronic lumps.I now have to try to find the instructions on how to individually reset each and every one of my so called smart home devices.  Each one has a slightly different multi step procedure that has to be meticulously followed.I called Amazon hoping at least they would have a single solution for all Alexa devices.  Alas no.  It is taking hours of mind numbing password resetting.If you are thinking of building a smart home with Alexa beware that security experts advise that you change your WiFi password frequently.",0
5,"Very helpful gadget.  I love mine.
  
",7.Jun.19,Yes,"Bought it for my sister.  She really likes it.  She isn't too tech savvy and is learning to use it more and  more.  As I am mine.  It does a lot more than I use it for, but am continually using more of its functions.  The emails from Amazon about its uses are helpful.  I am going to give one to a friend who is going blind and teach her how to use it.  She shops on Amazon a lot so it will be helpful for her to reorder.  Listen to books.  As well as know the time, play music, set alarms, timers and reminders.  I use it for all those.",0
5,"Great Little Alexa device
  
",7.Jun.19,Yes,"We have an Alexa show 2 and that is the gold standard as far as we are concerned.  After we bought that, we wanted more Alexa devices for other rooms but did not want the expense of additional Shows.  So we bought a few Dots to try in other rooms.  We are very satisfied with the voice recognition, sound quality and responsiveness.  The Show, of course, has even better speakers plus video, but the dot is still great for playing music, etc in a smaller space.  Very happy with this purchase.",0
5,"Improved my lifestyle...
  
",8.Jun.19,Yes,"Alexa works great!  Definitely makes my life easier...due to health issues it's difficult for me to do some activities.  We bought the ECHO Plus, 4 DOTs and the ECHO SHOW.  We even have a DOT in the garage so I can contact my husband when he's working outside.  Gave DOTs and a SHOW to our children and grandchildren so we can video chat easily.My recent physical therapist bought 10 DOTs for his family.  A brother with severe disabilities shares a 2 level home with his parents.  They usually communicate with cell phones, but with the Alexa system they can communicate hands free!  If someone has fallen or is injured and cannot get to a phone, they can use voice to call for help.My mother fell in her home a few weeks ago and did not have her Call Alert button around her neck.  She had to crawl across two rooms to reach the phone.  She was taken to the hospital and died a week later.  If she had the Alexa system, she might have lived longer.We highly recommend any of the devices for Alexa.",0
5,"For $6 a month over 5 months, how could I resist?!
  
",8.Jun.19,Yes,"I love tech gadgets! I've been curious about this since the first one came out. I wanted to get one but didn't cause at the time, I thought the price was too high for my budget. Lately, a lot of devices have the payment plan option. Which is great for Prime members! There are so many pictures I decided to not upload any yet. Mine is charcoal. I ordered my first one on June 5th. It was delivered by UPS on June 6th. After enjoying sleep sounds and music, I ordered another for the front room/kitchen area!I live in an small apartment for reference. The sound when I'm playing Pandora radio is better than I thought it would be. There are times when there's volume changes between songs, so I have to adjust for that. I did notice that when music is playing, Alexa sometimes struggles to hear me. Then I have to get up and either manually adjust the volume or speak closer to the mic, which is annoying cause I like hands free. I did reposition the device and set it lower, that seemed to help except when the volume is playing too loud. I'm hoping with use, the issue improves. I don't have any smart home devices, so no opinion there. I never had any of the previous versions so nothing to compare it to. Looking forward to experimenting with skills!",0
4,"It_ good but...
  
",8.Jun.19,Yes,"Alexa frequently doesn_ understand what I_ saying &amp; in case you should speculate it_ me, I_e in my life been employed as a professional speaker, a platform salesman, I was in theatre when I was younger I know how to enunciate &amp; project my voice.  She_ just a bit spaced sometimes.  And I don_ mean my request was unrecognized or not part of the catalog I mean the same channel that she understands one minute, the next minute she gets hung up, like _lexa, SiriusXM Patriot boom no problem.  Then I switch her to Fox News during commercial, then no matter how I say it I can_ go back to patriot. She_l just keep saying _irius XM Fox News Channel from Sirius XM.  Then I have to look up the channel number &amp; be like channel 125 or whatever.  I_ being a bit nit picky it_ a cool device but there are some glitches.  And if you_e going to have a bug in your house, you kinda want it to be on point.",0
3,"Regret buying
  
",8.Jun.19,Yes,"Wish I never purchased these Alexa devices. I have an Alexa Show and Echo dot. The dot was $49 and the next day went on sale for $29.... They are good for music at my desk and that is about it.  Outside the weather, they are rarely useful answering any question I pose.  The voice recognition does not work well on either from across a room unless it is perfectly quiet or you are yelling. The reminders are nice once you program. Updates keep turning on things that you turn off. I don_ like that from a privacy standpoint. Not sure if I will throw both away as they are past the return point.  I wanted the show to monitor blink cameras.  It takes more time for it to show the camera including asking than I could just pick up my phone and look.",0
5,"Why have I deprived myself of such a device for so long!!!!
  
",8.Jun.19,Yes,"Excellent! We have 3, bedroom, family room, and kitchen. Love listening to Amazon music while cooking!  Our house is hard to hear from one room to the next and me and my husband can drop into one of the other rooms if we need something and the other can hear.

We have several different lights hooked up to it and we_e become _azy !! _lexa, turn off the bedroom lights. _lexa, play my crickets playlist. _lexa, what_ the status of my security?, then she_l ask me if I wanna arm it!

5,"Try Stereo pairs for music
  
",8.Jun.19,Yes,"I've got these all over the apartment now. They sound great when set up in Stereo pairs for music.  I can tell they don't match the clarity of my old full size speakers, but they take up far less space and don't need wires running all over the place. I tried the Google mini, and the Dots are much better for music.I have a couple of smart plugs for fans and a couple of smart bulbs. I know Alexa has all sorts of other features that I never use, but I love just being able to tell her to turn on and off my lights, fans and play music.",0
4,"Speaker Sound
  
",8.Jun.19,Yes,"I bought Alexa when it first came out then bought Echo Dot. After purchasing the Echo Dot Second Gen I couldn't be more pleased. I added the Wemo lighting and with my disability just saying TURN ON HER LIGHT it was truly a life changer for me. Not to mention I love playing music that fits my mood. I set routines for the morning. It's impressive, my friends are seeing the benefits and they too run out and order their Alexa and Echo Dot.",0
5,"Worth every penny!
  
",8.Jun.19,Yes,"My favorite aspect is the colored lights.  I love that I_ notified when I_e received a shipment.  I enter through my garage, so I need a reason to go to my front door.  Alexa helps make sure I get all my packages.  I also absolutely love the fact that it_ handsfree.  I always forget to put music before I start cooking, but the dot makes it SO easy.

5,"A must have in the Smart Home era.
  
",9.Jun.19,Yes,"Quick and easy set up. It_ a Must have in the smart home era. I recommend getting a case for it the smart home era. I recommend getting a case for it and attaching it directly to the outlet so it_ out of the way. A virtual home assistant to help with everything from basic inquiries to smart home applications. I live in a 2 story 2500 sq. ft. home and I have 2. However, properly placed, you could get by with just one. The more you invest in its application, the more you get out of it. Alexa sets my daily and weekly schedules and handles mundane tasks with no complaints. I waited until they were on sale for 25$ before buying them. I suggest you do the same and use the saved money to invest in smart plugs and bulbs. A good investment for the home.",0
4,"I love my Echo Dot, however...
  
",9.Jun.19,Yes,"My Echo Dot was a gift from my daughter. I love it. However. I've had a couple of issues. On the back, the second outlet is misaligned so it can't be used. But one side is fine so I can plug the adapter into the wall. Next, I was listening to my favorite radio station through the Echo Dot and it began playing the same music over and over. After checking the station on another device, I realized it was my Echo Dot. That could be a one time problem. I still love my Echo Dot. As I said it was a present from my daughter.",0
5,"Useful and Fun too
  
",10.Jun.19,Yes,"I received this a gift last Christmas but didn't get around to setting it up until this May so I am still figuring things out. I like the daily briefing of weather and news, the Question of the Day and playing the extra Jeopardy clues. I also set reminders and make lists.  Sound quality is not fantastic but okay for what I use it for. Alexa, for the most part, understands what I am asking/saying and responds appropriately.  Still playing around with this gadget but I am enjoying it.",0
5,"You'll need multiple devices to cover the house (no surprise).
  
",11.Jun.19,Yes,"I wound up with 4 Dots, Living room / 2 kids rooms / game room with the phone app counting as a 5th.  No more yelling up the stairs that dinner is ready, come down for awhile, etc.  Only thing to keep in mind is to name the devices with something very simple so you can use Drop-In without it babbling on and on about not knowing a given name.  The utility is excellent.  I had considered getting a home intercom, but this served the purpose as well as the net-integration.  I haven't tried bridging to my Wemo devices yet, but I'll consider other home automation solutions as we go.  By the way... no... Alexa isn't sitting there recording everything you say and reporting to the supreme technology overlords.  As a developer I can reassure you we/they are not that sinister or covert and wouldn't let a company get away with it.  Relax, enjoy the convenience.",0
5,"Who knew?
  
",11.Jun.19,Yes,"I never ever thought I would venture into home automation, much less talk to a ""dot"" but this thing is pretty cool.

I had one in the bathroom and it was a strain if you tried to listen while in the shower.The gen3 version has phenomenal sound in comparison. I love the aesthetic and syncing to the Alexa app/group is a breeze. My biggest complaint (and this may be my internet vs groups) is that when you ask for something to be played on a group channel,  some of the speakers play and others don_.",0
3,"Not sure about the hype.
  
",12.Jun.19,Yes,"Getting Alexa to recognize my voice at first was very difficult. I had to reset the device to factory settings before it would work. Also, my Bluetooth Vava Voom speaker for half the price has better sound quality. It is useful to have to control other Bluetooth devices in the house with voice commands, such as lights and power outlets. I_ hoping I will find more uses for the device.. Devices seem to get confused with the Alexa integration, which is frustrating. I_ not really seeing all they hype yet.",0

",13.Jun.19,Yes,"I received this device as part of the purchase of a new smart home.  After the Echo was installed and setup by the installer, I unplugged it and put it in a closet and do not intend on using it because I don't need it to operate my other smart devices.  Echo devices are a great technology, but I've seen news articles where Amazon employees listen and use it for their amusement.  I've also seen news articles where recorded statements from these devices were subpoenaed to use in court to prosecute people.  These devices invade my privacy and I don't want anything in my home that records everything that I or my family say.",0

",13.Jun.19,Yes,"Oh my gosh, I adore these things! I have two currently, one upstairs and downstairs. It is amazing for calling my kids downstairs, dropping in to hear what's going on. My kids now know they can say 'Alexa call 911' in the event of an emergency and will connect through my contacts. All off the added features are so cool! The bedtime story is my favorite by far, as I have it mounted to my hallway wall and it reads to my kids before bed! The trivia and games are so much fun! I could just go on and on about the endless features and am amazed with new discoveries daily. LOVE THIS!",0
2,"6 months using it speaker is dying
  
",13.Jun.19,Yes,"It's been 6 months of using it and the speaker is already dying. The sound comes with that white noise of a speaker dying, I believe that it being an amazon product which is so greatly advertised it should have been of greater quality. Not so.Voice recognition is terrible if you dont have an american accent it will NOT recognize what you're requesting. It should also be made wireless, cables, really? in 2019? come on.I would like a refund or a replacement.",0

",13.Jun.19,Yes,I put off getting one because of all the hipe about someone listening in on me.  I thought about it and decided I never have anything interesting to say anyway.  I love this thing.  It's so easy to work and I used the shopping list every day.It's great.,1

",13.Jun.19,Yes,I_e had this speaker for only about a month. I like that it_ louder but now it_ sounding staticky from being turned up all the way during our favorite songs.

I_l update my review after I_e had her a few weeks. Update: I_ not sure if I_ not asking the right questions or what but many responses from Alexa are to go to the App to manage your list. None of my music is showing in the _ist so no idea why.. I_e been trying to create a second music list but that isn_ working either. Alexa says hmm I don_ know that one more than I care to hear or she doesn_ follow direction. She goes completely off topic and has occasionally just stopped playing in the middle of a song. The App is not helpful in navigating either. Hoping to find better instructions on how to _anage your lists,0

5,"An amazing device - You'll want more than one.
  
",14.Jun.19,Yes,"I am absolutely delighted with the Amazon Echo Dot 3rd generation. After using the first one for a while I bought two more to put in other rooms. I bought the first one to control lamps, using the $10 Mini Smart Plug for each lamp and it is perfect for this. The Dot easily replaced my much more expensive and less reliable internet clock radio. It is adequate for casual playing of music. I use an OontZ Angle 3 PLUS when I want better sound. I use the Dot to find out the time at night without having to open my eyes. It will call numbers on my contact list, give me the latest news and it even read a Wikipedia article to me when I asked about Marco Polo.",0
5,"Looks and sounds much better than 2nd Generation Dots
  
",14.Jun.19,Yes,"Bought 3 of these 3rd Gens' to upgrade from my 2nd Gens'. 3rd Generation looks and sounds much better with deeper base and expanded high end point. The tin sound is gone, but sometimes it can feel like the voice response from Alexa is coming from inside a container of some sort. General sounds and music sound great though. Set up was super easy if you already have the Alexa app. Make sure you open that app before you plug in your device and it will likely find it for you and ask if you want to add it to your devices. Very happy and glad I upgraded.  (No changes to functionality that I have found, just better looking and sounding)",0
2,"Alexa needs a hearing aid
  
",14.Jun.19,Yes,"I was super excited to try this. We have a google home and purchased this to sync with our Ring Doorbell and eventually sync with other home features. My coworker talked this up explaining it had a lot of really neat features like Alexa Guard.  However, after trying it out I find it hard to believe that this could reliably ""Guard"" anything or send me alerts of breaking glass or a smoke detector because it can't hear anything! We set it up in our bedroom on one of the nightstands. I would ask Alexa to play music/the weather/insert command here and nothing. I had to repeat myself over and over to get it to do anything and even more so when it was playing music. The TV wasn't on and no one else was making noise so it definitely wasn't background noise affecting it's hearing capabilities. Not happy with this at all and returning it.",0
5,"Delightful
  
",14.Jun.19,Yes,"Elegant design with really impressive sound quality for the discounted price ($70 for 3). My favorite feature of the echo system is its ability to set up multiple-room speaker groups, which allows users to stream music or podcasts from multiple echo devices synchronically. It_ disappointing, however, that one cannot play audio books from Audible on a multiple-speaker group. The voice recognition technology isn_ perfect, but overall I_ satisfied with my experience as a non-native English speaker. Moreover, I feel confident that Amazon will keep improving the system and I can_ wait to see what new tricks Alexa will be able to do in near the future!!!",0
3,"Better than previous version  Not the BEST
  
",15.Jun.19,Yes,"Hi, I will go with my comparison to google home mini.Positive Side: Sound quality got better and voice recognition got better than the previous versions.Volume level is higher than google home mini and also attractive with those lights around the speaker.Negative side: First thing i noticed was the charging pin was changed from previous versions and no longer supports your android phone chargers. Not sure whats the benefit of changing the charging pin to old style.Second Negative thing is when i connect it to my desktop it slows down the video and audio sync, i don_ see this issue with my google home mini.Third Negative over google home mini is the voice recognition and search results, google home mini out stands in this category.",0
2,"It's a Piece of Crap
  
",15.Jun.19,Yes,"The Echo Dot is only good for playing music and asking Alexa questions. But, if you intend to use it for smart home devices to give Alexa commands to turn lights, etc, on or off, forget it. I have 3 Echo Dots (3rd generations). One of them suddenly stopped recognizing my Wemo smart plug, LIFX smart bulb, and ADT home security, even though all of them are linked to the same network. Other people have reported on this same type of problem with their Echo Dot 3rd generations where one of the units suddenly tells you ""I can't find a device named &lt;xxxx&gt;"" even though the skill for that device is enabled and linked to the Alexa account. And, even trying all of the various suggestions listed at both the Amazon site and other websites, none of it resolves the problem.  I've also found the Amazon support team to be unresponsive to requests. If people want an artificial intelligence device that they can do more than ask for weather reports, the time, date, year, or to play music, I would suggest trying another company's device.",0
5,"I didn't want to like it
  
",15.Jun.19,Yes,"I had been looking for a good quality, small speaker and had some past products I wasn't happy with.  We decided to try the Echo Dot, even though I was hesitant to have Alexa listening to everything. But honestly we love it! It is so handy and I love that she'll play any music I ask for. I know that I'm not tapping into all the features that this speaker offers, but I'm thrilled with what we're getting out of it. I will probably buy another one in the next year for another room.",0
5,"EASY to setup
  
",15.Jun.19,Yes,"I am 73 and decided to get two of the Dots to use with Alexa. I was worried about how to hook it up and thought I would have to wait for one of my son in laws to help me but to my surprise it was easy, oh so easy. I found the sound very clear and love hearing the ""rain on tin roof, babbling brook"" nature sounds. We have only had it three days but we are enjoying it and believe we will purchase two more soon. We dim our inside and outside lights with them. Its amazing what all you can do. I just need time to figure out some of the other additional components to keep learning these incredible devices. I will say they are attractive, we got the charcoal and the size is not intrusive.",0
2,"Very Inconsistent
  
",15.Jun.19,Yes,"We have issues almost every day.  Issues have been: unable to open Hulu, unable to play a show from Home Screen or when FireTV is asleep, large delays to execute a command, same commands not working each day and having to rephrase the command, and overriding volume output settings from our soundbar to the Dot.  I will not plan to use Alexa for additional smart home items since we have inconsistent results.",0
5,"A helpful tool
  
",16.Jun.19,Yes,"Bought this for my 10 year old. She LOVES it. And now we all want one. lolMy daughter has ADHD/APD, and we are a homeschooling family. It is great for her to use as a tool for her education and for organization. She sets alarms so she can remember things like putting her retainer in at night, and sets timers. She asks it how to spell things, or to learn random facts about her current interests (which is hit or miss, depending on the question... It's not as much of a wealth of information as a Google search, but it also doesn't come with as many risks.)She uses the calendar a lot, and listens to audible books.Her favorite part is the freedom to listen to whatever music she wants. Lullaby/ambient music helps her get to sleep at night. And she frequently has mini dance parties in her room with her sisters and friends. lol. We do have an Amazon Music subscription, so we have more choices.It's perfect for her needs.Now I need one for me in the kitchen.",0
5,"3rd Gen Alexa - Even Better but fix Boxcar Willie's songs, very poor quality
  
",16.Jun.19,Yes,"Sound is somewhat better than 2nd generation.  Amazing that they can get such good sound from such a small speaker.Selection of songs is quite good, they say 10,000,000.  Would be great if she would tell you which artists she has for a particular song, I look it up on YouTube then specify the artist I want.  Volume not consistent from song to song.Still having problems with Boxcar Willie songs, I've asked them to fix it but it has been months . . .",0
2,"Better speaker, worse microphone
  
",17.Jun.19,Yes,"I really, really wanted to love this product.  There is a marked improvement in bass output and volume, such that I can hear Alexa speaking several rooms away if I crank the volume all the way up.Unfortunately, if I leave the volume at a more reasonable level, the 3rd gen dot still sounds like it_ speaking to me from several rooms away.  The bass is present, but the mid and treble tones suffer clarity.  I can get great music quality from the device if I equalize it with software before the Dot gets it, so I_ sure this thing is capable of a better balance, but as is you_e limited to the undocumented features of asking Alexa to increase or decrease the bass or treble, each of which seem to have three levels (less/normal/more) and I_e not yet found a happy balance that provides crisp voice quality.Worse, the number of microphones has decreased from 7 to 4.  In my use case (a mud room that frequently has running water or machinery) the accuracy of commands has plummeted, if the thing even hears the wake word at all.  The only way to guarantee it hears me is to shout _LEXA! at the top of my lungs, wait until I visually see the blue ring, and then scream what I want it to do while maintaining a direct line of sight between my overloud gabber and the deviceSpeaking of the blue light, unlike previous generations which would do a spinny _hinking effect while processing your query, the 3rd gen dot goes dark after it accepts your command, and only lights up again to indicate it has completed your request.Unfortunately, the ring going dark is the same thing that happens if the device decides you weren_ talking to it at all, so if you_e sending a command that may have some lag before the result (for example, turning on a Zigbee light through an Alexa skill) you kind of have to hope and pray it_ trying to do what you asked, with no way of knowing if your command was ignored outright.And finally, on the subject of ignored commands: follow-up mode has been turned into hot garbage of late.  It will listen for your command, and as soon as you_e done uttering it, shut off like a defiant toddler.My advice: pass on this model.  The 2nd gen Dot is definitely too quiet, but if you already own one, there are plenty of third party drop-in speakers that fix that problem without losing 3 microphones.  If you_e new to the ecosystem, plunk down the extra cash for a full-sized Echo.",0
5,"Really helpful!
  
",17.Jun.19,Yes,"I have a home based sewing business that involves client appointments.  I had always had problems keeping track of appointments, mainly because most of the time I was not near a calendar or was busy in another room.Since Alexa moved in, I_ able to have her add appointments to my calendar, all I need to remember is to ask every morning what my day looks like.  If I need further assistance, I_l have her remind me 30 minutes prior to appointment.  She does the work of a secretary and has really helped to keep me organized. I have three of them and keep one in the basement where I spend part of the day-one in the kitchen near my main phone and one in the house where I do most of my sewing.  I find that the reminder is very helpful also especially when I have something on the stove.  In the meantime I have music anytime I want it!  How did I live without her?",0

",17.Jun.19,Yes,"Where has the DOT Been on my life? I HAVE OWNED A FULL-SIZE ALEXA for a couple of years. But I decided to buy an echo dot when they were on sale at Amazon. I bought it for my bedroom. I love having it and I don't know why I didn't do it sooner! When I go to bed at night I tell Alexa what I want music I want her to play.  I also tell her how long I want her to play it! That's wonderful.  also, if I'm sleeping and don't want to wake up to look at my clock I just ask Alexa what time it is!

",17.Jun.19,Yes,"This is my first time ever buying or owning a device like this. This is a pretty handy little thing. Amazon had these on sale for $30 during Mother_ Day weekend, so I got one for myself. I_ not a mother, but a sale on Amazon is a sale on Amazon. Lol.Anyways, this thing is pretty awesome. The sound quality is great and I use Alexa a lot to stream music from my phone via bluetooth. She has a hard time understanding me, but that_ not her fault. Sometimes she can_ hear me or I speak too fast. She can be slow to respond or reply, but that_ not her fault either. That_ all due to whenever the WiFi is slow as hell.Overall this was a great buy for a great price. Glad I got it on sale. Would_e paid full price if I had to. I recommend.",0

",17.Jun.19,Yes,"Sometimes when it's loud the Alexa command does not register so I have to repeat myself, but overall it's really good.  Mainly I use it to get the weather.  When I get  power blip after a storm I ask  it the time so set my microwave clock.  The countdown timer is good too.  My favorite thing is listening to news channels via Tune it, but sometimes when you first connect to tune in you get 3 ads in a row so that's annoying.  I pair it with my wireless speaker too.  I did buy a smart bulb that was offered with it but that was hard to set up and lost the connection after a few weeks so I took it out.",0
5,"What a difference
  
",17.Jun.19,Yes,"My husband and I won this at a raffle and replaced our Gen1 in our living room with this Gen 3. The sound quality is outstanding in comparison - we thought the sound was coming through our TV soundbar it was that loud and clear. Definitely worth every penny to get this one over an older generation. Sometimes I have to repeat myself to get Alexa to listen to a command, but that's likely a fault of us having her close to the TV and in a corner rather than out in the open in a quieter location. Would definitely recommend! Love my Echo Dot.",0

",17.Jun.19,Yes,"I recently got this for father's day.  Spent a few hours trying to get it to stream music from ANY source including Pandora and iTunes. It would seem like it was going to work but then it would say ""Sorry, I can't play the music"".  I then contacted support who verified there is an issue with the device (after almost another hour of trouble shooting) and showing them that all my other Echo's can play the music.  I even tried it with another account on a neighbors wifi.  Still doesn't work.  Amazon says this is a known issue but they don't know when it will be resolved (per Amazon - could be one week, could be three weeks, just keep trying and EVENTUALLY it will work).  It has already been over 3 weeks so not very hopeful it's going to work EVER.  Amazon also had me contact my service provider originally as they thought it was my wifi.  After hours of working with them and even getting a new router delivered it still didn't work.  Then Amazon realized it was the speaker.  I also purchased an Echo Link that has the same issue.  I've given them plenty of time to resolve so posting this so that other potential buyers are aware before making this purchase.  I'm going out now to buy a Google Home Mini.",0

",17.Jun.19,Yes,"I like the Echo, this is my second one.  The first is a 2nd generation and has very clear sound quality.  The 3rd gen is very muffled despite having turned treble way up and bass way down.  The look is good... the features the same as always but I wish I could get the clarity of the 2nd gen on this one.  I didn't return it because others have said they've tried and gotten no where.  So I'm keeping it, but it's relegated to an area of the house where we probably won't use it as much.",0

",17.Jun.19,Yes,I won_ an echo at my work Christmas party.  Best thing ever! Got sick of my son stealing it so I ordered him a DOT and it_ great. I can run to the store and open the app and connect directly to either device.  I can make announcements via Alexa_ voice if needed.  I can control the volume. And also! Activate freetime which makes it so he is unable to access inappropriate material.  The stereo sound is outstanding and it_ so underpriced.  I suggest buying the Echo and Echo Dot _.  So worth it!!,0

It has a better wieght to it, which means a bigger magnet, which means a better, louder speaker. I love my 2nd gen dot, but I'm so happy with the 3rd. The sound quality is a vast improvement. It also seems to recognize my voice more easily. My 2nd gen had trouble hearing me when the alarm was playing. That's no longer an issue.I bought one because they are on sale, not expecting much.

5,"Easy setup
  
",18.Jun.19,Yes,"Setup was very straight-forward using my iPad and the iOS Alexa app. Of particular note, the Echo Dot can connect to WiFi at either 2.4 or 5 GHz, but connection at 5 GHz may require setting your router to manually assign a channel. Initially, the Echo Dot did not see the 5 GHz network on my Apple Airport Extreme, but after an online search, the solution was found. I changed the channel selection on the Airport Extreme from automatic to manual, selecting channel 161, and the Dot connected without issue.As I also use smart bulbs, a smart wall switch and a smart wall plug, these were integrated into the Echo Dot and Alexa using the iOS TuyaSmart app, and the SmartLife skill. The skill will link to a TuyaSmart account and integrate the smart devices registered there into Alexa. Similarly, the August Smart Home skill connected an August door lock into Alexa.Some Alexa skills that may be of interest are Big Sky Weather (local weather and forecast), Relax My Cat (nice background music) and AnyList (shopping list).Skills that I found that do not work are the Anova sous vide (many reports of it not working; Anova may have changed something on their side) and SmartThings to control Samsung devices. The issue with the Samsung device is with a TV; although the device is listed in the Echo, Alexa can turn it off, but cannot turn it on. This dysfunctional control appears to be related to the power state of the TV and the _ake on LAN control provided by Samsung; however, if a Roku or Firestick (but not AppleTV) is connected to the Samsung TV, Alexa can access them and indirectly turn the TV on when they become active (via HDMI-CEC).",0
5,"It's like having a personal assistant!
  
",18.Jun.19,Yes,"I love my Echo Dot! I can go about my day and don't have to stop what I'm doing to look stuff up or write things down. I just wake Alexa and ask her to: calculate a measurement for a recipe; set a timer for my wash or dryer cycle; add something to my grocery list; or just a remind me to do something at a later time.There's a small learning curve to know the correct terms, like instead of ""turn off"" use ""stop"" when I'm done hearing music. Or sometimes I'll say ""dining"" in my command and she'll ask ""did you mean dining."" And I also have to remember to say Alexa for each different command.It's actually been fun learning how to use my Echo Dot and how to set up routines that make life easier: for instance, when I say Alexa good night, it triggers the smart plug of the lamp next to me off and turns the smart plug of my lamp on my night table on. I've also set my porch lights and back yard lights on a daily schedule using smart bulbs. No more turning the porch lights on when we're leaving before dusk if we're returning after dark.",0

The sound quality FAR surpassed my expectations.You do have to add _kills you want Alexa to have; for instance, the cardio workouts. That is super easy to do though.

4,"Alexa's fine, we've sold our souls
  
",18.Jun.19,Yes,"Fought and fought not getting this, then finally gave up. Now I love it. Set up was easy. My favorite trick is getting her to ""announce"" a message when I'm upstairs, baby's sleeping so can't yell, and I know my wife's downstairs and her volume on her cellphone is off. So I'll have Alexa speak a message to her. It'll be a fun trick to use around Halloween. My complaint about Alexa is her choice in music. Sometimes she's in my mood, and other times, she takes a wild left turn and starts playing annoying stuff, no matter how many times I tell her to play something different, the genre doesn't change. Maybe next generation can start offering choices? I don't know.",0

The battery kept dying on me even though I had it fully charged I ended up sending the product back and because of my experience with this product I will no longer order Electronics off of Amazon this is my second bad experience.My friends and me all had a hard time connecting this device so the whole reason why you'd want it is to connect it to your Wi-Fi at home and in less if you're really knowledgeable unless if I just got a defective one it's not a very good product,0

I found it almost impossible to set up a calendar.  I went on line and selected the top site offering help.  It turned out to really be one of the computer scams for buying new protection that does nothing and has no relation to Alexa.  I could not find a manual to download.,0

I ask for the current outside ""dew point"" and get a definition of dew point. Not what I wanted. She does understand humidity, so I get that reading. I don't have any switches or outlet connected yet, so can't speak to that.I do like the feature that Alexa can listen for smoke and CO alarms while I'm out, and message my phone about it.",0
5,"It is an Echo Dot, it works as advertised.
  
",19.Jun.19,Yes,"I bought a couple of these. The sound quality is good, however I did attach some plug to speakers that really rounded out the music experience. I an very happy with my Echo Dots. I use them a lot. I had issues at first with losing wifi connection, however once I went to a secure (not open) WIFI connection; I have not had an issue since. I will purchase more in the future (to have in every room of the house. I am just anxiously waiting to get my invite for the Echo Auto...",0
5,"Love it!
  
",19.Jun.19,Yes,"I can't say enough positive things about this. I received it as a gift and love it! It was easy to set up. It has loads of things you can do with it. She understands me perfectly and answers all my questions in a clear voice. Love that you can raise or lower the volume, bass and treble. That comes in handy when playing music. She has answers to all my questions. You can play games, get the news, the weather and so much more.",0
5,"Love this upgrade!
  
",19.Jun.19,Yes,"I was fine with my Echo Dot 2nd Generation, then these bad boys had to go on Lightning Deal sale, and I could miss out on that. The volume increase alone makes it worth the cost, and it's a breeze to set up, especially if you've already had an Echo device in your home. I can't wait to add more Smart Home devices. I know the Man is watching and listening, but I've been spoiled too much to give all this convenience up!",0
5,"Good sound for such a compact device
  
",19.Jun.19,Yes,"Good sound for such a compact device. I have this one bedside with nighttime and morning routines setup for my convenience. I also have it play _ain sounds skill throughout the night for some good white noise. Use it occasionally for a sleep timer and an alarm. I like the white color, works better with our decor than the black. I like the small footprint too; doesn_ take up a whole lot of space.",0
4,"Better looking and sounding but....
  
",20.Jun.19,Yes,The 3rd Generation Echo Dot was a great aesthetic improvement over the 2nd generation. This one is slightly bigger but sounds better than the previous generation. My only complaint with this one is the power plug. The 3rd generation no longer comes with a USB adapter and USB to USB-C cord. It now comes with a molded A/C adapter to USB-C power cord. This is annoying because it limits the installation options IMO. A/C power adapters typically take up more room than the average USB power adapter and this one is no exception. Fortunately I bought this unit to replace a 2nd Generation inside my house to then move the 2nd Generation to my pool area. If I had the 3rd generation as my only option it would be a problematic install because outdoor outlets are limited. There is one outlet available to power my TV and any devices I need to connect to the TV. In this particular location I installed a high wattage 4 port USB charger (plugged into the second outlet) which had one open port. The 4 port USB charger is much smaller than any 4 outlet power strip that I would need to power the 4 devices currently plugged into the USB charger. I'm not sure why Amazon felt the need to change to the power cord. The previous gen power configuration worked fine. Just like screen mirroring was a great function on the previous Gen Fire TV but Amazon felt the need to remove it with the new 4K Fire TV. Sometimes I wonder who Amazon consults before making changes like this.,0
4,"Cool gadget that the family loves to play around with
  
",20.Jun.19,Yes,"There are hours of entertainment in simply asking alexa random questions or streaming music from every genre all over the world and it is worth the purchase price just for those features alone. There is just SO much other stuff alexa can do that it truly blows my mind, i'll never in a million years use every feature.I would seriously recommend turning off the voice activated purchase options. I'm a bit of a tight wad and It kinda freaks me out how easy it is to buy something without being fully aware of it. Also if using alexa for streaming music there are adds that play inbetween songs and lots of opportunities for upselling amazon products and services. A bit of a bummer that amazon uses these devices to advertise to people but i get it and it's not a deal breaker. Overall super cool little smart speaker that i highly recommend. I don't think I'd want this in everyroom of my house controlling everything but It's a fun toy.",0
3,"Requesting music is complicated across devices...
  
",20.Jun.19,Yes,"Signed up for Amazon Music on one Dot. Now, every time we ask our Amazon Show to play the music we OWN in our library, we get a long advertisement for the $14-something family plan. I_ already paying for the ONE device I want it on. But I fear I am going to get nagged any time I want to listen to music on any other Amazon device.It used to be easier to just play from my library on all devices. Easier before I started PAYING for a _ERVICE. Go figure.Maybe there is a magic phrase other Amazon devices understand that would play from my library without hassle of listening to the family plan ad. So far, I do not know what it is.Ultimately, the user is asked if they want to switch streaming to the different device being used. But it_ a long ad to get there, and you have to endure it every, stinking time...",0
5,"great little addition to bedroom!
  
",20.Jun.19,Yes,"I like this little fella! I have one of the first generations and it is really awesome. Bringing Alexa to the bedroom if a very convenient way to interact with A.I. I hope Alexa does not listen all the time to conversations in the bedroom LOLAlso, sound quality is impressive for such a small speaker. Voice recognition is great so far! I think this can make a great travel buddy when you have 10 hrs of driving with kids, you can connect it wirelessly to your hotspot, and plug it in your car charger (with a dongle) then you have Alexa on the go! read books, play music, have trivia!  just a thought!",0
4,"Fairly easy installation
  
",20.Jun.19,Yes,Got this as a free gift for purchasing another product. I have Google Home everything in my house but I figured I'd give it a shot. I am using it to stream music in the rear garage. I also use it to set timers when I'm working in the garage so I don't forget to feed the dog etc. Using the audio output into a receiver and two pairs of speakers as the sound from it is not the best by any means. I can not comment on integration and control of other devices as I do not use it for that purpose.,0
5,"Convenient and portable
  
",21.Jun.19,Yes,"I love this device! I bought multiple ones to put throughout the house and love them! Why pay thousands of dollars for home sound sound systems when I can have these in each room. They can control my lights, play music, answer questions, and make calls. I seriously couldn_ be happier and think it is one of the best things of our house. I also bought the adapter that allows it to hang from the outlet so it takes up no space and carries the sound into the room. Definitely a great addition as well! Highly recommend both!!!",0
5,"Super useful
  
",21.Jun.19,Yes,I love my Echo. Alexa is entertaining and smart. I like that she can tell me fun facts about stuff. There is also an option where she will have a conversation with you and it actually works good.The sound quality is great and it seems to hear me really well. It also understands my young kids. I love the discounted price on amazon music unlimited that I get.Before i had it I thought it was silly but I love it now. It's super useful! It doesn't require prime but definitely works better when you have prime.,0
1,"The Dot Does Not Work!
  
",21.Jun.19,Yes,"Doesn_ work. It only bluetooths through my phone and doesn_ respond to commands. I spoke to 3 customer service reps/technical support to all who could not resolve the issue. Another thing is, they will constantly call you until you answer the phone. The reps hardly speak any English and hard to understand. I kept asking politely to repeat himself, but there was a huge language barrier. So my frustrations are #1 Echo Dot does not work for what I need it to do and #2 They need to have people who speak English fluently.",0
3,"Echo Dot, simplicity of the future.
  
",21.Jun.19,Yes,"Dot has a simple durable look with powerful mini Boombox sound took me beyond imagination... Alexa is very tenacious, polite, meticulous assistant. She goes beyond the ethics of artificial intelligence capacity and gives you any answer for a question. In a few hours of interacting with Alexa, she eneded up giving me many wrong answers or outdated informations. The initial installation of the Dot took many hours and more hours of migraine headache; possible bug in the app so, fix it to increase rating. Overall, Dot is that kind of devices that would simplifies the future. Great device ___",0

Warranty 90 days,  Customer service says can_ help.  Did offer some trade value, but this one only worked 6 months so not so sure if I will waste money on another. Poor engineering Only  way to access bios/hardware/software is via WiFi which cannot be accessed unless it connects first.  Did software update and it died.  Dumb design, a USB port would give access but, of course, there is none.",0
5,"Great First foray into smart home
  
",22.Jun.19,Yes,"Received this for Father_ Day. I love technology but I have had to sacrifice a lot of toys in the past decade. I was stoked! Totally unexpected gift.Looked good and almost too simple... then it got pretty great. Plugged it in and download Alexa app on my iPhone 6 Plus (seriously, I_ on a major budget)After entering my parents WiFi password I to the app and giving the dot a couple minutes... Alexa became a part of my life.So did the fun.My personal favorite is when I say _lexa wake me up at (time) and the tone wakes me the next morning. My automatic response is _lexa, good morning. She says _ood morning and gives me a brief update of news/weather Then I follow up with _lexa play top Christian music - she plays from Amazon free music.The sound is terrific in the upper apt of my parents house. I_l be moving into a home in about a month with my wife and son - once my new salary kicks in, I plan on getting a couple more to sync with it around the house. - aaand sell some bulky sound equipment I use for tunes.",0
5,"Can connect another speaker to it
  
",22.Jun.19,Yes,"I actually really like the sound quality, I think it's beautiful and very interactive. Great for listening to audible. I can connect it to another speaker through audio cable if I choose to, however I'm only using it for my room so I don't need a loud speaker. But for those that want really strong sound quality for music, you can just get a separate speaker and you can plug an audio cable through it. I enjoy listening to music from the echo dot even without any additional speakers so no problem for me here!",0
5,"Echo Dot 3 rd generation
  
",22.Jun.19,Yes,This unit is much nicer and better than the 1st generation I had ages ago. Easy to set up and the sound is very good considering small speaker. When I plugged a set of Desktop speakers with a subwoofer it really came alive. I received another one just like it for Father's Day and I have them set up in my office space and Living room. The intercom feature comes in handy when my wife wants to call me to watch a show or have dinner. Highly recommended.,0
3,"Alexa should never try to sell to us
  
",23.Jun.19,Yes,"I love the devices; I have them in most rooms in my house. But, I would never have gotten one if I knew how often the devices would waste my time trying to upsell my music subscription. It is constantly, and wrongly, thinking that music is already streaming on a new device. Can I trivially have it cancel that other music (which isn't actually streaming)? Nope. I have to listen to the same advertisement for 'the family plan'. There is zero possibility that Amazon doesn't know how annoying this is. It's such a good device, with great sound quality, but the experience is ruined by Amazon trying to get us a few more $ from me per month. I wish I never got one of these, despite the overall quality, as it introduces purposefully annoying advertising into my home. It's entirely unacceptable.",0
4,"I love my echo devices, but..............
  
",23.Jun.19,Yes,"We have four echo devices in the home and office. They have become an indispensable aspect of our lives. The quality of her feedback has greatly improved over time. Can't wait to see where we are in another decade. My only complaint, and it is a major annoyance, is the volume on the echo dot. At night (in bed as I fall asleep) and in the office I want to listen to very quiet music. Volume 1 is too loud for sleep or the office. She doesn't go lower than volume one. I have to switch to youtube on my laptop to get appropriate volume control. We love the new whisper commands.",0
5,"I like the Echo 3rd Gen all around...
  
",23.Jun.19,Yes,"I like the Echo all around. I_ pleased with the sound. I mostly use it for the music (with Amazon Music). I like how I don_ have to go pull out my little radios. I can just listen to the radio, my playlists, a specific song just by voice. Helps when I_ multitasking. I enjoy the _eminders this feature has helped a lot with some of my forgetfulness_ends a reminder to my phone_Good bundle deal(s) on the Echo too, got a handful of echos because family members liked the Echo when they saw me using it.",0
5,"significant sound quality upgrade and better look
  
",23.Jun.19,Yes,"The third gen echo dot is a major improvement over its predecessor. It looks much more like a valuable and useful product. It's bigger, heavier, and the speaker looks real, complete with a cloth covering. The last version looked much more like a toy and not a home appliance. The sound quality is also massively improved. Lows are many times more pronounced and the mid range is solid. It's still missing something on the high end, and it sounds a bit muddy as a result, but this version has reached the point of a decent home speaker that I'd feel comfortable using by itself. The external 3.5 mm jack is still there however, which I appreciate. I'd definitely recommend upgrading to the third generation echo dot, and don't forget to take advantage of amazon's trade-in program if you own the previous model.",0
5,"So handy and really fun!
  
",23.Jun.19,Yes,"I had no idea how handy and used this would become when I bought it!  So much fun to play any music, any white noise, podcast, whatever, all voice activated.  My favorite ridiculously simple feature is the lists... whenever I think of something, can verbalize, and it_ added to the lists on my phone in the app... love, love, love!!!  Play song quiz all the time with my 10 year old, among other things. Great for quick questions, handy and fun for a million things.",0

",23.Jun.19,Yes,"My son gave me an Alexa for Mother_ Day.  It only worked for a hour and then apparently died.  I went ahead and ordered another one and paid for it.  It seems to be working fine.  I am still learning to work with it.  I know it will do a lot of things for me.  Right now it makes my shopping lists, reminds me of things, and plays some songs I want to hear.  If it doesn_ let me down, I will get another one for the back of my house.  I would have given it five stars if the first one had worked as it should have.",0
1,"There were problems from the beginning
  
",24.Jun.19,Yes,"So when it arrived, I had problems trying to install the app so I called Amazon tech support.  The technician asked if he could get on my computer so I let him.  Then scared me too death!  He started going into my system files telling me I had a virus (not true).  I have McAfee and Malwarebytes and nothing gets past them.  I was so scared because all I wanted was him to help me install the app but after the way he was going deep inside my system files I demanded he  remove himself from my computer.  I ended up purchasing Google Home and I couldn't be happier.  Google Home is the best device I have ever purchased and I recommend it to everyone.",0

4,"Learning how to use it.
  
",24.Jun.19,Yes,"It has so many good features that I need time to learn how to take advantage of them. I understood Alexa was a speaker like, for example, to pair with my phone or pc to listen to music, but it does not work properly for that purpose. With my phone it sounds good, but not with my pc. However I am happy with this product, I just need to learn how to use it. I have received emails from Amazon with ideas about its skills, which is very helpful.",0
3,"Better than previous models, but not by much
  
",24.Jun.19,Yes,"Meh.  I was expecting a lot more from this newer, upgraded version.  Some things are actually worse, like recognizing and responding to my commands.  I find myself repeating my commands more than with the older echo dot I own.  The sound quality is better that the older model, but still not great.  Maybe this product will improve with future software updates.  Let_ hope.  Otherwise I would suggest waiting for the next release!",0
5,"Love It!!!
  
",25.Jun.19,Yes,"We have an Echo Plus in our living room, so we bought this in order to listen to music in our bedroom. It has very good sound. Since I already had the Alexa app, when the Dot arrived to my home, it was already listed so I just had to do the simple activation process.  I did not have to add skills to it as they carried over from having the Plus.A downside is the voice recognition could be better from both the Plus and Dot. If the items (software) were new, I could understand the problems but the operational part of these is not a new concept. At times when asking for a radio station, I have to repeat multiple times, or Alexa runs the wrong station.",0
5,"Skeptic turned believer!
  
",25.Jun.19,Yes,"I bought the Echo Dot (3rd Gen) not knowing if I would even be able to use many functions on it, and wondering if anyone else in the family would even use is.  Months later and I learn a little more and a little more of what it is capable of!  I have a couple lights hooked up to it, so when I walk in the house carrying way too many bags of groceries, I don't have to put them down before turning on the lights, I just tell Alexa to turn them on for me!  I love the ease of set up and the ease of use.  Everyone in the family uses it!  We listen to music, play games, read books, and obviously turn on the lights.  I cannot wait to get a Fire Stick and start using that with Alexa also!",0
5,"Was Sceptical If I Would Even Use IT
  
",25.Jun.19,Yes,As I stated above didn't even think I would use them but I can tell you I use them on a daily basis as does my whole family.  We use for everything from a house intercom to a voice remote for the TV and cable boxes to checking the weather.  One interesting thing we were able to use it for that we didn't realize was to be able to be out of the house and drop in with the app on my phone and talk to our kids in the house even if they don't answer there phone.,0
3,"Time will tell
  
",25.Jun.19,Yes,Updating review after having poor experience w device connecting to Bluetooth then not and not being able to reconnect. Talked w customer support that was very helpful and showed her another way (not that I found when googling) to restart device.  The dot could still not find Bluetooth pairing until customer service suggested I ask her to _lexa pair that worked. I hope it sticks because the sound is quite good.,0
5,"Alexa is priceless!
  
",25.Jun.19,Yes,"I have a very poor memory, so the best thing about Alexa is when I remember to use her. The reminders, timers, etc. are priceless to me. My son gave it to me as a birthday gift and it_ the best gift I_e ever gotten. So thoughtful. I use it every day for various things. I love the email tips and tricks that teach me new things I can have her do. I_ finding that she_ more important to me than my phone. Gasp!",0
3,"Alexa is language impaired.
  
",25.Jun.19,Yes,"I cannot get this xenophobic lump to recognize Hindi or Korean artists. It_ a big problem for me as I prefer non-USA music . I own music in both these languages but this dumb thing can_ manage to access it because apparently it only understands American names. Seriously, you sell the stuff. This lump on wires should at least recognize the names of artists you sell. Every time I ask it for Rain, it plays rain. I tried to get Itif Aslam..nothing. If as advertised Unlimited even is, there_ a lot of really great stuff out there not in American and you can_  get it if the dumb bunch of chips cannot understand non-western names.",0
2,"Terrible sound Quality...
  
",25.Jun.19,Yes,"I bought this thinking it would be as good as or better than the first Echo Dot I bought a couple years ago...WRONG...the sound quality is muffled, bassy and sounds like someone has thrown a pillow over the speaker...actually needs to be sent back...listening to it, at least TRYING to listen to it is irritating...Music played though it sounds really muffled and horrible. Needs a brighter sound...too bad they don't include bass &amp; treble controls on these things.",0
2,"Some good, some bad
  
",26.Jun.19,Yes,"It's good when you have one. It plays music well and controls your smart devices. There's a few hiccups here and there, but overall, it's good. If I still had the one Echo, this would probably be a 5 star review. The problem came in when I added 2 more Echos around the house.It gets bad when you have them in multiple places around the house. Getting music to play consistently on the multi-room groups is an exercise in frustration. The music will stop playing on one or more of the echos intermittently. Sometimes it comes back on, sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes you try to tell Alexa to play the music on a group, and it will just play on the Echo you're talking to. There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to this problem. I normally use Amazon Music. I also have the Plex skill installed, which is a total nightmare, but that may not be Amazon's problem, so I won't discount any stars for that. Bottom line, if you're buying this for whole house music, I would look elsewhere. This just isn't a stable platform for that. If you want to turn off lights, go for it.When these things start flying planes, I'm out.",0
4,"Good Product!  Lacks battery charge.
  
",26.Jun.19,Yes,"I like that it's so simple to play my music, ask questions and set alarms, etc. Bluetooth pairing is easy with ""some"" items. Also, it WORKS with my firestick tv(I contacted Amazon prior to purchasing and was told it did NOT work with Firestick).  Alexa searches for me on Fire and finds what I ask.  Dislikes:  It holds NO battery charge :(  Certain items to pair are difficult to figure out(still have not).  I considered Alexa when I could no longer buy a small cordless speaker I wanted.  When Alexa went on sale, I purchased.  I'm happy with the purchase and would do so again. Not the best speaker around but definately worth the $39.00 I spent!",0

5,"Alexa can do it all!
  
",27.Jun.19,Yes,"I got an Echo dot as a wedding gift and in one day we liked it so much that we ordered two more for around the house! Alexa makes life so much easier. Need to make a shopping list just tell her what you want when you think of it during the day. Need to set an alarm before you forget just tell her and she will go off when you need it. Need to set a reminder to call the doctor she can do that too.I use Alexa for so many things. She starts my microwave, she turns off the bedroom lights when I need her to, and she plays music for me at night to help me fall asleep. I also use her all day during work to listen to music.The echo dot alone has a lot of features and it is extremely easy to set up you can have it up and running in less than 1 minute. If you want to be able to use it with your phone you do have to download an app. The echo dot 3rd Generation has decent sound quality it doesn't hurt my ears when I listen to music all day and it does have adjustable sound feature such as the bass and the treble.If you really want to maximize the echo dots potential I highly suggest that you get yourself some Alexa compatible light bulbs and Alexa compatible smart plugs. We went all the way and got an Alexa compatible microwave. You will not regret adding the echo dot 3rd Generation to your smart home Arsenal.",0
5,"SUPER CONVENIENT, easy to use, very capable.
  
",27.Jun.19,Yes,"Pretty awesome device, very VERY useful and convenient. Plan to add more smart features to my house now that I see what this is capable of. I use it for my alarm clock because it is very loud, Bluetooth speaker for my fire TV stick, the find my phone feature is awesome. Still haven't figured out how to send and receive messages to other alexa devices but it's well worth the money, the sound quality really surprised me how good it sounds for music as well. Alexa is definitely my little assistant. Would definitely recommend. A tip for anyone who has or is thinking of getting one, make sure to train alexa to your voice an it will recognize you ALOT better. An it is almost completely voice controlled all the way to the volume settings.",0
5,"Great Little Device, FUN!
  
",27.Jun.19,Yes,"We were given this echo dot as a gift. We weren_ sure how often we_ use it actually. But now we ask Alexa things multiple times a day. We ask for weather forecasts, when our favorite sports teams play next, what we should eat for dinner along with recipe ideas etc. The speaker is great on this device so we frequently listen to music. Set up is fairly quick. You download an app and plug the device in. My family also plays trivia games with the device which we love. There_ so much to do and the price is so reasonable. We appreciate the emails that we receive from Amazon telling us all about the amazing things Alexa can do for us. This device is fun and informative. We recommend it highly.

I could use other types of timers and alarms but if I did that I would no longer have _lexa to talk too. Plus she will play almost every piece of music I ask her for.

Note not all answers are available.While the units will give you most information you ask for, it is the ""Drop In"" feature that I really was interested in. Unfortunately the drop in gets confused.  When asked to drop in on the office from the family room, the MIL unit activates, same thing happens when asked to drop in on the MIL from the office, the family room gets activated.The Amazon Dot would have been a very good solution to the elderly.  This type of wireless assistant to a senior citizen who does not know how to use or possess smart phone technology, could prove very beneficial.  But much improvement in voice recognition for elderly speakers is needed.  My 89 yo MIL doesn't / can't speak loud enough to activate Alexa.Amazon really has missed the boat, when it comes to use of the Echo for senior's.",0
5,"Every Generation gets stronger, better, faster, ....
  
",28.Jun.19,Yes,"With the onslaught of content coming from google, amazon, and other big companies competing in smart home devices; it's hard to choose. For my smart home I chose Amazon as my primary provider. Smart sticks, smart subs/speakers/hubs/cameras/ everything. This device was my first step in making my room smart.If you're looking for a portable speaker/smart device, than I suggest this. It's not a hub, but it's a part of the Echo family.Portable speakers (with wifi), calculator, someone to tell your dad jokes too or test your wisdom or wits.  Alexa is the voice of the Echo family, and like family, we welcome ours with open arms. The dot can be renamed, (I named mine Echo) she's small enough to go unnoticed, and she's got a loud volume that you'll need to yell over her to be heard.Alexa is kind of like the middle man of making your home smart. Of course, you'll need a hub eventually for things like a smart sub. But if you have Alexa enabled lights, or electronics for that matter, you'll be able to speak with her directly to operate those. I.E.: Alexa, turn the lights on, Alexa, make the lights purple, etc.I use my device every day, mostly as a speaker playing music all the time. For individual listening to music, I would recommend volume level 3.5 or 4.  For the house party, 6-8, depending on actual volume of the party. For hang outs with guests and family, I suggest volume 1-2 for a subtle music. Alexa is also able to take multiple commands at once, so you can tell her to change the volume, dim the lights while increasing the bass of your songs simultaneously.Amazon's music library has literally 20,000,000 songs to choose from; and ad free. That's essential to a man who listen's to music every day for hours on end. (Unlike Spotify, with their ads.....)5/5 for sound5/5 for portability5/5 voice recognition5/5 easy installation5/5 smart home device.",17
5,"Your Smart Home Starts Here
  
",28.Jun.19,Yes,"It's already made our lives better. When we get the smart home set up, it will be super nice to use these to just speak commands and program scheduled household ""scenes"" (read: ambiance) by fiat. But beware using 2 or more in a single area of the home, unless you have at maximum 3 and name them each differently.Main con: you can only name this thing Alexa, Computer, or Echo. It would be way better to name them whatever the hell you want! After all, you paid for it! If you have to raise your voice, you could end up activating the one in the next room, or even all of your household Alexas - unless you name them differently.Be ready to buy more stuff! That's right, going down this road means you are going to build a smart home (smart light switches, outlets or outlet appliance plug connectors, smart lightbulbs alternatively to the outlet plugs/outlets), etc. This is a good thing, but only if you plan to stick around and enjoy all this in your home for some years to come. If you rent an apartment, it might make more sense to do the one Alexa device in the living room, maybe one in the master bedroom, and then use smart lightbulbs and removable smart outlet plugs. That way, when you move, your stuff can just be packed into a box or two and you're unplugged till you reach the new pad.",0
5,"Smart Speakers Are Great
  
",28.Jun.19,Yes,"I'm in full blown consolidate and condense mode insofar as all of the gadgets, doodads and accompanying paraphernalia I've accumulated over the years. My sister gave us a 1st generation echo dot a couple of Christmases ago which we only recently set-up. I was in love.The old lady followed that up with a 2nd generation Hub and it was off to the races. Getting rid of ancient radios and receivers; storing away albums, tapes and discs. The expanses of empty shelf space are just a beautiful sight to behold. Added ultimate music for $3.99 per month and I'm good to go.Still figuring out all of the features but even so I am impressed with the convenience, compactness and the surprising sound quality. I imagine Google's is pretty comparable but either way I'd say go for it.",0

",28.Jun.19,Yes,"This is our first echo device. My wife and I like it a lot! Music sounds good on it with it sitting in the middle of a small wooden table. Getting the weather on it is nice. We are getting used to asking questions and enjoy some of the games. Setup was real simple and painless. I got one of the smart switches for a hard to reach lamp in a corner, that works good to. I'd like a couple smart bulbs, but have to wait for a deal on them. I'm seriously thinking of getting one for the bedroom.",0
4,"Good Upgrade
  
",29.Jun.19,Yes,"This is a good upgrade when coming from the Gen 1 device. The sound quality has become much more solid and much less tinny. The large Echo units are certainly much better, but these are nice to have around where space is tight. They are also really easy to hide behind lamps. I only docked a star because it took me about six attempts to connect to wifi. That was super annoying because it does not do that quickly to begin with. That sixth attempt connected finally. The device also kept stating that it was ""not registered."" There are two methods to pair the Echo Dot and get it linked within the Alexa app. If you purchased the device directly from Amazon, make sure you pair it from the list of devices already on your Device list in the app. You new, unconnected one will already be listed there. If you attempt to pair it by just clicking + and adding the device itself, the platform is not smart enough to realize you are pairing it to its existing account. So, it thinks it is someone else trying to connect it, thereby making it think it's ""not registered."" All set now, just not a 5-star experience (four echos).",0
4,"Good purchase.....love it...even though it is like a kid...
  
",29.Jun.19,Yes,"Yes, Alexa to me is like having a small kid because sometimes I have to yell at it so that it could stop or to listen to me. I think Alexa has flaws like if you ask ""Do you work for the CIA?"" Alexa does listen but it will shutdown without responding, there are several questions that she does that.I love the idea of having all my smart devices from home on one app, well i still have the other apps, but Alexa app can control all other devices. I like it because I can just instruct it to turn off a light or on, I also like Alexa because I just add items to my shopping list while I am cooking. I do recommend this device....I would love Alexa to partner with Google, that way you can have a superb search engine, currently Alexa uses Bing.",0
4,"My elderly father is challenged...
  
",29.Jun.19,Yes,"I bought echo and echo plus in hopes that my elderly father of 85 could use  it to help him turn off lights and possibly call for help should he need assistance. I have had this product for about a week.  I found it difficult to set up the Echo on my own, however technical assistance was very friendly to use.  Alexa often does not understand my father, and my father who is 'profoundly' hard of hearing cannot understand Alexa very well.  So far, my father can't comprehend how to command Alexa.  Perhaps with a little more time and training he will catch on.  As for my me, age 60, I love having Alexa around to turn off the lights and play some music, and ask her what the weather is today, and other things as I get to know her.  Hope to check back as I become accustomed to you you know how it goes...",0
5,"Make life better,  buy it!
  
",30.Jun.19,Yes,"This is my 2nd Alexa device. What I like about it is the ease of getting it set up. Being  a prime member the device comes to me registered with amazon straight out of the box. The only thing i had to do was connect it to my wifi and have it sync up with my Original  Alexa 1st generation speaker( which still works great after 4 years). The 3rd generation Dot is perfect for my bedroom.  It sits on my dresser taking up next to no space at all. I use it as an alarm, weather center, music, and story teller. Could i live without this device? Yes i sure could, but why would I when this device makes my personal life easier. What i mean is. I dont have to turn on the T.V to get the news  push buttons to set a alarm clock turn on a radio to listen to music that i probably dont like even flip on a light switch or turn on the tv and change the channel.  I can even re-order toilet paper or ramen noodles if i want or need to.",0

My husband is VERY technically expert especially with networking stuff (as a matter of fact, the first 2 calls he got were from people who did not know ANYWHERE near as much about troubleshooting this problem and he did). The 3rd call he at least spoke with someone that was technically competent.  They worked together for a couple of hours or so and could not come up with a cause or solution.  The person he talked to said they would research it some more and get back to him in 2 weeks but that's now been about 5-6 weeks ago.  Obviously, they have no clue.",0

",30.Jun.19,Yes,"I can get in bed with the light on and get settled in, and tell Alexa to turn off the lights. I can stumble into the kitchen in the morning and tell Alexa to turn on some lights and set them to 25% brightness. I can tell Alexa to clean whichever room I want vacuumed. I also have multiple things on Alexa controlled plug ins, like scentsy burners, programmed to come on an hour before my spouse gets home and go off three hours later.Alexa does it all with very little error. WAAAAAY Better than even a year ago.",0

",1.Jul.19,Yes,"I own a total of (3) 2nd Gen Dots and now (2) of the 3rd Gen and I personally cannot stand the sound quality!  I've made so many adjustments trying to make it sound less boomy and muffled to no avail.  I think they tried too hard for such a limited size device.  I can't believe I'm actually saying it, but I prefer the 2nd Gen sound.  I can barely understanding what Alexa is saying 1/2 the time and I find myself asking to repeat and continually adjusting volume and EQ settings.  Music is definitely better, but asking questions or having conversation?  Meh.",0
5,"Behold the power of listening.
  
",1.Jul.19,Yes,"Ok, so honestly the best part about Alexa is I can scream from the other room and she will listen and answer me. My own husband and kids don't even do that. I never have to repeat myself, she's polite, and she always answers back in a polite tone. If it takes owning a speaker to be heard in my household then by God I'm doing it.Added bonus, my husband is convinced she records all of our conversations and hates being around her. I like to randomly move her into whatever room he's in and watch the hilarity unfold. If she really is recording us then whoever is in charge of listening and reviewing said conversations will be thoroughly entertained and will probably seek psychological help for our household with all the talk of poop and farts.",0
5,"Very multifunctional, worth buying!!
  
",1.Jul.19,Yes,"I absolutely love having Alexa in our home! We use her for so much more than music.I rarely watch the news so I rely on her for the weather, she also provides recipes. I use her timer function often to set device timers for my kids and I absolutely love using the music alarm for the mornings. I also use the thunderstorm sounds to help relax and fall asleep at night.I was skeptical at first about buying one, but its definitely one of our better purchases this year!",0
5,"YOU ARE PROMPT WITH YOUR ORDERS. I APPRECIATE IT.
  
",1.Jul.19,Yes,"I am amazed at the technology embedded in this device.  From the first time I activated it, I have been intrigued with all I can do with it. Even though I am in my late 80's, I think I surprised my son when I wanted Alexa to put a ""treble"" on the voice that was coming over the machine. She told me the range of treble possibilities, and I kept giving commands till it reached the right range for me. It is wonderful.. My son said he would have never thought of that.",0
5,"Always Love my ECHO
  
",2.Jul.19,Yes,"Love the product. I can order or play music anyplace in my house. Love the echo dot. If you have low bandwidth however, be aware the Echo uses up bandwidth and can cause internet interruption if you have several devices on at the same time.. This is not a big deal for those of you who have several routers.  I turn off mine in the kitchen if we are watching TV.  I leave the other one one all the time upstairs in my Childs room.  If I have my Smart tv on, and someone is using the iPad, then we can loose bandwidth and loss of connection. Like I said before if you have unlimited bandwidth you should not have an issue at all.  It was easy to set up, and a cinch to teach her to take requests such as play a iTunes play list when it prefers Amazon music.  I like that I can switch between iTunes and Amazon music.  Alexia knows more every time I use it.... she knows.... everything ..... lol",1
5,"Alexa, please write a review for me
  
",2.Jul.19,Yes,"I already had a 2nd generation Echo Dot, an Echo Auto and the Alexa app on my laptop. When I plugged in the new Echo, it instantly synced and did everything I needed on its own. I honestly can't remember how difficult it was to set up my first Echo, but I know it wasn't a challenge. The third generation of Echo is really much nicer looking than the second generation. The sound quality is dramatically better. It unobtrusively sits in the living room without looking out of place. It responds really quick to commands. I will probably get a few more to add throughout the house and will simply replace my second generation unit. I'm continually adding skills and find life is much simpler with Alexa around. When Alexa is added to my refrigerator, washer and dryer, and many other appliances, and Amazon grocery arrives in my neighborhood, my life will be fulfilled. I can ask Alexa to microwave my popcorn on my Amazon microwave and ask my refrigerator to reorder milk. The day is coming and i will happily embrace living in an Amazon home. I'm still waiting for Amazon cellular service and an Amazon car. (Hint-hint there, Amazon!) Imagine if we could only have one bill a month for EVERYTHING we need! Ok, yeah, I might be dreaming. But with gadgets as awesome as the third generation of Echo Dot, I think Amazon could make it a reality!",0
5,"Definitely worth the price!! Fun little addition to Alexa.
  
",2.Jul.19,Yes,"I've been thinking about ordering an Echo for ages. I've recently purchased a Ring Doorbell and decided to finally pick a couple up so that I could put one on each floor of my house, link them with my Alexa, and have one on each floor therefore beign able to hear my Ring device wherever I am.Anyway, first Amazon is running an amazing deal! I purchased two at $25!!!The sound quality is good. I guess it could be a little louder, but there's a lot of sound coming out of that little cylinder. I can hear my doorbell and it's loud enough for my whole daycare to have a dance party, so what more could you really want?!?!We liked them so much my oldest asked for one for his room. At $25 I didn't hesitate.Probably my favorite feature is the ""announce"" feature. I can tell Alexa to announce anything and she will repeat my message through all the other devices in the house. No more up and down three flights of stairs to ask someone to take the garbage out!!To sum it up, the Echo is definitely worth the price and has rejuvenated my whole family's interest in the Alexa we've had for 4 or 5 years.",0
5,"Great sound quality from such a little speaker
  
",2.Jul.19,Yes,"I got this with a Amazon blink camera bundle and was impressed at how helpful it can be. I ended up getting a smart plug too so that I can use Alexa to turn on/off a lamp in our living room. It was super convenient and love that I can just issue a command and the light responds within a second!My wife uses this for pandora and the sound quality is quite impressive for such a small speaker.I have noticed sometimes Alexa doesn_ quite catch what you are trying to say, but 9 out 10 times it will get it correct and is very quick and accurate. My kids will use it to ask the weather for the day, or just talk to it... which is where the mute button comes in real handy.It has a mute and volume buttons so that it will mute listening to you and you can of course change the volume on Alexa responses.All in all it is a nice concept have and comes in handy when building a smart home.",0
4,"Pretty cool
  
",2.Jul.19,Yes,"I ordered two, one for my husband and one for myself. My husband uses his for sleep sounds. The other one was set up in the kitchen because i basically live in there between cooking, cleaning, and work. I absolutely love it so far. I really like not having to stop cooking to look up something for my recipes. A little lazy, but really great for my time management. My kids really like it. They've been playing the Lemonade Stand game and the animal exercise game like crazy. It does a decent job understanding us, my 3 year old included. You do have to be extremely specific when you ask a question though. Not a big deal. The drop in is really fun with kids too! We like it so much, we're considering buying the kids version next!But.....my absolute favorite thing about them is that i can make phone calls. We live in a very rural area with basically no cell service so this was a big help!",0

",2.Jul.19,Yes,"I bought one love it ,just bought two more for my sisters as gifts about two weeks ago 30$ each. I would have saved 10$ if I bought them today bummer. She does have her issues. She can_  do a lot of things I was hoping she could do.Sometimes I have to yell at her. loI,Her learning needs improvement. I also bought a smart plug and a smart light Bulb both which said,Alexa voice compatible.But the light bulb only turns the lights on and off with Alexa So I had to down load three separate apps for full function of the light.color changing, scenes etc...But I still like her. She is still a fairly reliable assistant who never calls in sick! But she does have malfunctions occasionally. If only she could sling. I also enjoy slinging, your first time slinging is always so Special!",0
5,"Noticeably better than 2nd
  
",2.Jul.19,Yes,"I have a whole bunch of Echos throughout the house, and decided to try out the 3rd gen to see what was better. Turns out... a lot!First, it is noticeably larger than the 2nd gen. It's also noticeably heavier. I love the new design, which is a little bit rounder and the LED light ring is better integrated into the edge. Seamless.Sound is also noticeably improved with better bass. There is a larger power brick instead of just a simple USB cable, most likely due to larger power requirements of the internal components.If you're just passing by the 3rd Gen Dot, you probably won't think it's much different... but it truly is. Great job, Amazon. I'm excited to see what you do with the 4th gen after seeing so many great changes from 2nd to 3rd.",0
5,"We are in absolute LOVE with the Echo Dot!!
  
",2.Jul.19,Yes,"I got the 3rd generations in every room now. All because of the sound quality. I love these little echos! I use mine alot for music and the alarm clock. The kids use their for jokes, music, to find out questions about things for school work or just things they are curious about. I love having it because Inised to play music off of my phone so if I got a call or a text of course my music would get interrupted or if my phone died i_ have to put it on the charger in another room. So this is very helpful in that arena. Also we use the drop in feature when we tell the kids to do something, or when we leave the house we drop in on the dog so he can hear our voice and we can hear if he is barking like crazy at random people outside. Its really fancy to us.",0
4,"Still Figuring it Out
  
",2.Jul.19,Yes,"Yet another device that has to be set up using a smartphone.  Be careful downloading the app from the AppStore.  I downloaded two wrong apps before I found the actual Echo Setup app.  Other apps that are designed to make you think they're what you need pop up at the top of the list.  I finally had to delete them from my phone and start over again in order to get the Echo to work.  I still can't figure out how to link it to other Bluetooth speakers - using it is not as intuitive as the ads would have you think.  Still, once I got the basic stuff down, it's fun to use and convenient if you like to listen to lots of different types of music.",0
1,"A Scam?
  
",2.Jul.19,Yes,"I have an echo dot and it works fine. I gave a gift of one and tried to set it up. Impossible! The instructions were bewildering and impossible to follow so we called a chat person who could barely speak English and she informed us we needed something for a firewall? which she could install for $385.00. After an hour of confusing and nonsensical instructions, we gave up.  We were convinced we had been preempted by scam people in Canada. We still cannot get it to connect and will now have to take her computer to an apple store to see what information they obtained from it in our conversation with these people.",0
5,"Great Tech!
  
",2.Jul.19,Yes,"After waiting, I finally purchased my first Echo Dot.  I love it...what nice technology!  At its price I highly recommend it.  I just ordered another and will buy a third shortly.  I purchased 10 smart plugs and it_ a breeze now controlling, fans, heaters, lighting, my sound bar, air purifiers, coffee makers, etc, etc.  I can check the weather add to my shopping list, open the garage door and have Alex wake me whenever the need arises.  And all from my chair without getting up.  I can say _lexa turn on Security from my bed and external flood light respond.  This is great tech!",0
4,"I Love This Product, Other Than the Sound Going Up and Down
  
",2.Jul.19,Yes,"I love this echo dot, but the speaker is sometimes fuzzy (I don't listen to it loudly), and the sound goes up and down, like commercials do on a TV.  It's very annoying, and the voice recognition feature should also be a little more reliable (things like Alexa volume up, Alexa volume down, etc).  I also feel like I'm screaming at it for it to recognize my voice.  It seems to recognize male voices better, perhaps due to the deeper voice? I don't have an accent, so that isn't the issue, I just wish that it worked a bit better.",0
4,"Good Little Alexa
  
",2.Jul.19,Yes,"Small and sleek; easy to disguise behind flowers or small decorations. The sound quality is good, especially for such a small speaker. I am disappointed, however, with the voice recognition. We also have an Alexa Echo and it seems that both of their ""hearing"" has gone very downhill. Sometimes it'll take us a few times screaming into the actual microphone to get a response. Other than that, it's a handy and inexpensive little tool that I'd recommend for any and every household.",0
5,"Great Echo Dot!
  
",2.Jul.19,Yes,"I love having these echo dots on each of my rooms. They have so many functions for our family. We use them primarily for music, alarms, timers, lists &amp; intercom.  A few things we often ask it about the weather, what time it is, how to spell things, etc. The voice recognition has definitely become better too as the speaker for listening to music. I would definitely recommend. There are a ton more things you can do with this but these are the features we use on a daily basis.",0
3,"Umm!
  
",2.Jul.19,Yes,"I have an Echo in my bedroom and thought it would be nice to have music in the kitchen since I spend so much time there. However, I love my Echo but the Dot just does not have the same sound as the Echo. It does provide music and Alexa integration is okay, but I will be upgrading to another Echo for the kitchen in the near future - probably on Prime Day, and then I'll use the Dot in the Master bathroom for those long soaks in the tub.",0
5,"LOVE MY ECHO DOT!
  
",2.Jul.19,Yes,"This is a wonderful product and much better from the older models.  The speaker is quite loud (but you can connect a bluetooth speaker to the device if you wish it to be louder).  Very easy to set up.  If you do not want Alexa to call random people in your phone, when setting up the device there is a question asking you to give permission to Alexa to access your phone contacts.  Great product!  Highly recommend!",0
3,"Easy to use, when things work correctly
  
",3.Jul.19,Yes,"I've had about a 75% success rate on my voice commands. My song and artist requests are often misinterpreted. Then if anything is playing I'm left shouting twice as loud as the news or music that's on to get it to listen for a command.  My biggest issue has been with the Alexa app, and it's speaker group settings. I bought this Dot to plug into a home stereo receiver, and there is no adjustment for the split-second delay when grouping my Echo speaker and this Dot using the aux out.  The Alexa app is slow and difficult to use for anything really. The sound out of the speaker is average quality and volume for the size, not great. There's no portable option with the 3rd gen now that it requires the AC adapter instead of a USB cable for power.",0
5,"Always a helpful kitchen helper
  
",3.Jul.19,Yes,"We use this in our kitchen.  We play Spotify on it and ask her to set timers, alarms and reminders.  She's a very useful assistant.  We don't have a landline so I use the drop in feature to call and check on my kids when we aren't home.  She doesn't take up a lot of space yet has a decent speaker.  I keep adding them to other rooms in the house.  I was skeptical of the privacy aspect of an Echo but found the app easy to use and the content easy to control so far.",0
4,"Very cool item, but it &amp; you have a learning curve.
  
",3.Jul.19,Yes,"UPDATE:I can't figure out how to make the DOT play music at the same time as using an external plugged in speaker...and or... I can't make it work on its own when its plugged into an external speaker.Original review: I never wanted an item that is listening all the time, BUT... when my iphone &amp; dock for my stereo was dying, this is about as cheap of a replacement as I found.  Best part, you can link a bunch of them together and listen to music all over the house.Challenges are its &amp; your learning curve to make the thing do what you want....  I have only had it a couple of weeks and used it 5-6 times, but so far pretty darned cool.I want a list of the correct phrases to say for things to happen, I will search on line to see if it exists.",0

",3.Jul.19,Yes,"I bought this for my condo.  It is a smart home. Attached fast and was working with the smart plugs in seconds. I had to replace my router two weeks later and this attached to it super fast.  Whole house was re-attached within two hours, most of it going to different plugs.  I do not get a chance to set it to my ecobee or K_vo but that is on my bucket list Well worth it!",0
5,"Improved Speaker
  
",4.Jul.19,Yes,This is our second echo dot.  My husband wanted one in his man cave so he could listen to Amazon Prime music while working out in our basement. The speaker on this new 3rd generation is improved over our 2nd generation dot which is in the kitchen.  One great feature is Drop In. Drop In works as an intercom system between our 2 dots. If I am in the kitchen and my husband is in the basement I can call to him using Drop In.,1
5,"Buy it!!
  
",4.Jul.19,Yes,"It provides hours of entertainment. Alexa is my very best assistant for my home office. She plays back ground music, she searches items, reminds my son to read and get ready for bed, make phone calls, reminds me to get ready for work, plays game with my sone while I_ busy working in my home office, tracks my Amazon shipment.Sound quality is impressive.It_ so much easier and faster then googling.",0
5,"Great sound for the size
  
",5.Jul.19,Yes,"I think other reviews have covered the many pros and cons of this device over others, so I_l just reiterate how this compares to the two others I own. Compared to Borge the second gen dot and to the Spot, the sound quality of this device is much louder and more dynamic. We have been really impressed by it after. Wing used to listening to music on the other two Alexa devices. We had even purchased a Bluetooth speaker to use with the second generation dot, but it is absolutely unnecessary to use with the third generation. The Spot_ audio is fine, but lacks the depth of the 3rd gen Dot.This unit is a bit larger than the previous generations, but it_ worth the extra counter space. It otherwise works just like the others, with no other issues in terms of Alexa integration or voice recognition. That technology is continually evolving, so we are consistently seeing advances in how we can interact with and be better understood by Alexa. Great purchase.",0
2,"Very Poor quality sound
  
",5.Jul.19,Yes,"I much prefer the gen 2 Dot. This one has very muddy and distorted sound It sounds ok playing music, but I don't use it for music, that's what my desktop computer is for. When I ask Alexa something, I can barely understand her. The gen 2 Dot is much better for what I use it for.Suggestion to Amazon: incorporate some kind of EQ.Update:I have never had any problems with Amazon returns, until now. I sent these back a week ago and customer service says it can be another 2 weeks before I get my refund, even though they have the items back.",0
5,"Best little smart assistant
  
",5.Jul.19,Yes,"Received as a gift from mt daughter.  I have been very impressed with the little device so far.  It has very good at detecting and accurately interpreting voice interactions.  The responses have been helpful and relevant to queries. Sound quality has been very good, especially considering its small size.  Music playback is nice and rich, just don't expect to be thumping gas-rich tunes at loud volumes without some distortion. And of course,  if you are a big Amazon user, the Amazon integration is superior.",0
5,"It_ something you didn_ know you needed
  
",5.Jul.19,Yes,"I have only had this for a few weeks, and with the exception of one problem it has worked as expected. I have enjoyed listening to music more frequently and it_ convenient to turn lights off and on. I had one incident when Alexa stopped talking although she was following commands. I unplugged the unit and plugged it back in and it was fine after that. This was a gift and I don_ think I would have purchased it myself but I am finding it useful.",0
4,"Room to improve
  
",5.Jul.19,Yes,"Alexa is very good at picking up what I say most of the time. Sometimes Alexa's answers affected by what I asked earlier. Just like if I say ""Alexa, what's 60 degrees in Celsius,"" it gets me the answer, but if I was asking it something else and then ask the same question as a follow-up question, it didn't know how to answer.I asked Alexa how far is Portland OR from Seattle WA. It doesn't know how to answer that. I think that should be easy.",0
1,"Doesn_ understand simple commands
  
",6.Jul.19,Yes,"You tell Alexa _urn off the lights and she says _ didn_ find a device named lights.  When you say _urn off the lights in the bedroom  she says _here are no devices name lights bedroom.  But if you phrase it differently like _urn on the lights in the bedroom she suddenly realizes I have Hue, and Lutron hubs and does something.  It seems like Alexa should be smart enough to know the room she is assigned to, and without being specific the generic term _ights should automatically refer to the ones in that same assigned room.I also use a Logitech Harmony with hub.  With the media control specifically, the Alexa and Logitech don_ seem to integrate well with _ctivities, so  when you want to do something like _atch Netflix (which is an activity on my Logitech remote that turns on the TV, Xbox, and the audio amplifier), once again Alexa I gets stupid and claims I have no devices that can do that operation.  Instead I must generically say turn on the Xbox (which also turns on the other devices), But doesn_ switch the inputs automatically.In general it just feels like she needs to understand more slang, and metaphorical terms... the current implementation is very frustrating to use because you have to memorize specific phrases and talk like a computer.",1
5,"Love this device
  
",6.Jul.19,Yes,I bought 3 of these for around the house just to try them out after seeing other echo devices at my daughter's house and how love them. I can without a doubt money well spent. My younger boys love Alexa and talk to her all the time and she not ever let us down. Speaker is good with voice and music. I put 1 in the garage mainly for the gaurd feature but it is able to play music loud enough that you can listen while working on projects. I will get a couple more when they go back on sale maybe prime days .,1
1,"BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!
  
",6.Jul.19,Yes,"Amazon has horrible customer service. If you have any problems with your account amazon disconnects all of your Alexa_ and if you have your refrigerator, lights, ring, garage door hooked up to Alexa like I do then nothing works and amazon solution is for you as the customer fix it yourself even though they are the ones that deleted everything from my account. In my case they did this twice to me and sent me emails in French about why they did it. I_ an American and only speak English!!! The amazon employees on the phone are no help either. First thing out of the team leaders mouth was I can_ do anything but send a email. I_e been a prime member since 2004 and this is how they treat their customers!!!",1
5,"Great little echo
  
",6.Jul.19,Yes,"Real nice little echo that is convenient in my living room to control my tv and lights. The sound quality is not as full and loud as my full size echos, but that_ okay because I use my sound system in the living room. A great less expensive than a full size echo option for rooms where you have a sound system already in place. But, don_ be fooled, you can still play quality music from this if you had to, it_ just for a stand alone speaker, the full echo is better...obviously because the dot is like a quarter of the height and speaker size...but quality is great for its size. For voice controls though, and in terms of hearing and understanding Alexa, this is still great...makes an excellent, less expensive extension to my echo ecosystem. Probably will get another dot soon for the kitchen.",0
4,"Echo Dot Third Generation
  
",6.Jul.19,Yes,I was given a 3rd generation Echo Dot as a gift.  I have a 2nd generation Echo Dot which I own for a couple of years.  To be perfectly honest I like the sound of my old 2nd generation Dot better than the new one.  The new Dot is much prettier looking but the sound is more muffled than the old Dot.  I use them both in different rooms but I prefer the sound of the old Dot.  I gave the 3rd generation Dot 4 stars because of the very nice look of it.,0
2,"3 month warranty only on these devices
  
",7.Jul.19,Yes,"So we purchased a echo dot gen 3 over the holiday sale, received it in December of 2018. In May of 2019 we heard a slight vibration in the speaker like it was blown. A month later it's rattles like a pop can at volumes over lever 4. Contacted Amazon customer service and the said the device only has a three month warranty and the best they could do was offer a 15% discount on a new device. We enjoy the echo products and have multiple throughout the house, and they are used to control our lights. Just keep in mind the warranty isn't worth _.",1
5,"Grandma loves it
  
",7.Jul.19,Yes,"My 91 year old Grandma saw a commercial with Alexa turning on and off the lights and she didn't understand how it worked.  Her birthday rolled around a couple weeks later and I got her a secondary Alexa (the Echo, she already has the main larger base) plus a few smart LED's for her back sunporch where she likes to sit and watch TV into the evening hours.  We were celebrating her birthday as it got dark and I said, ""Hey Grandma, watch this.  Alexa, turn on the Sunporch"" and all her lights came on.  She loved it.  She now uses it to listen to her favorite old school music, and when it gets dark, she doesn't even have to get out of her chair to light up the room.Downside: I will now probably have to get her more smart lights to ""magically"" turn on and off other rooms in the house.",0
4,"I didn_ know what I was missing and my family loves it too!
  
",7.Jul.19,Yes,"I put off bringing anything like this into my home for privacy concerns. I finally decided to get one for my patio to pair with my Bluetooth soundbar for streaming music and to avoid draining the battery on my phone.When I discovered all the usefulness of this device I decided to get an Echo Dot for every room, a kids model for my child, and an Echo Show for the kitchen for a total of 5 Echo devices.It_ been a pleasure to drop in on different rooms to speak with my family if my hands are full. No more shouting between rooms. I also love being able to call my extended family_ and friends Alexa devices. The skills and game are great also. We choose the ones we are most interested in and continue adding more. I hope we can keep up with them. The best ones are the multiplayer games that encourages family time.My child_ echo dot kids filters songs and content with illicit language or subjects. So I_ less concerned about what is playing on that than let_ say YouTube. I can see many future years of enjoyment.I gave it 4 stars because Alexa needs work on understanding enunciation of some words and if the streaming music volume is loud, you have to yell Alexa!!!",0
1,"This thing is creepy!
  
",7.Jul.19,Yes,"This thing is ALWAYS listening, I don't like it. I keep it unplugged until I want to listen to music then I plug it in. When products you talk about in your home privately starts appearing on your home computer as suggestion then it's time to unplug. If you don't mind that then I guess it's not a bad device.",2
5,"Very useful and easy to use
  
",7.Jul.19,Yes,"I love my Alexa. I love the ease of setup and how simple it is to use. I have Multiple Sclerosis and I don_ see well and days I cannot get up and so this device is so helpful to me in many ways. I use it from everything from playing music, to checking the daily forecast, to turning on and off lights. It_ not just a cool thing to have, it_ very useful for people like me who need a bit of help. I_ still new to using it and have not yet discovered it to its fullest potential so hopefully I can give more information as I discover it.",0
1,"DO NOT BUY, even Spotify does not work
  
",7.Jul.19,Yes,"What it can do for me: Spotify, Alexa skills. No Spotify not really work in stereo mode. Nothing works.What it cannot: read Apple News, read Books, Podcast, or play anything I bought from iTunes.And of course you cannot use smart speaker to have the same experience as browsing fb, Ins, and watch movies.Plus the sound is even worse than Sony SRS-XB10 Portable Speaker. I mean I already lowered my expectation.Really disappointed. Done",0
3,"Problems???
  
",7.Jul.19,Yes,"I can't understand it, because this Gen must be based on the previous gen but I the 3rd gen dots seem to be lacking compared to the previous gen. I have 2 of the 3rd gen and they share the same two problems: they frequently lose their internet connection and their voice recognition has problems. This may be due to the fact they are set up in a different house than my others. At one location, I have a mesh router but here I don't. I am also running a femtocell near my router which I do not do at my other location. Whatever the cause, I am not happy with the performance of either of these",0
5,"Great deal on Amazon Echo Dot
  
",7.Jul.19,Yes,"This is a great little gadget, it plays music from my iTunes Library, as well as Apple Music and Amazon Music.  It was a real pain to set up though.  It took two long, involved conversations with Amazon to get this puppy working, though.  Very happy now it is up and working but still cannot access all the music on iTunes, have no idea why.  All in all, a great price for a delivery that was just 2 days from the date of ordering of an exceptional product that works great.",0
4,"Works well
  
",7.Jul.19,Yes,"Overall I have to say that this makes my life way easier.  Generally it's very good at what it does.  However if your getting one for the first time know that you will need to say things exactly as it's programed to interprite.  This is especially true when using voice to activate routines.  The software that runs this device hasn't quight grasped the idea that it should understand synonyms. Not a deal breaker,  just something to know.",0
4,"Works way better then Siri and Cortina
  
",7.Jul.19,Yes,Its a valid 2nd to Google voice recognition.  Decent speaker.  I took off one star because it keeps saying another computer is accessing my Sirius XM account (literally did it after I immediately changed my Sirius XM password to lock out all other accounts and see if it would still do this).  Its a bug.  Directly going to sirius XM webside does not do the same and neither does roku for same account (I put in new pass for both).,0
2,"Frustrating
  
",7.Jul.19,Yes,"Let's get straight to the cons:- Hard time to pick the signal from the noise. In NYC where sirens go off every 10 mins, Alexa does not seem to respond to requests (might just need a better mic or maybe the algorithm needs more optimization).- Very often the speech rec. does not understand my requests and I have to shout and speak very slowly in order for Alexa to understand.- Wired.",0
2,"The Short Unhappy Life of My Echo Dot
  
",8.Jul.19,Yes,"I only got the Echo Dot because Amazon customer service told me I could not control my second AmazonBasics microwave with my Amazon Tap, which worked fine with my first microwave.  That was incorrect.  All I had to do was change my vocal command from ""Alexa, two minutes microwave"" to ""Alexa, two minutes ON microwave.""  Of course, I only found that out AFTER I bought two Echo devices as a result of the conversation with Amazon.Because Amazon had a $99 deal for Echo and Echo Dot together, I pounced.  I didn't realize you needed the same Echo model to use two of them to produce stereo sound.  I have two new Echo devices that cannot produce stereo sound together.  With that realization, both devices lost value.My Amazon Tap -- whose mention the Amazon customer service people found funny for some reason -- has a rechargeable battery and a charging base as well as a micro-USB port in the actual unit.  I use it as a portable device throughout my house and outside.  Really well-designed, portable and flexible.  Both the Echo and Echo dot require a/c power, lowering further the value of both for my purposes.The increase in sound quality between the Echo and the Dot is easily worth the price difference.  I was dumb to get the Dot.In a logical progression of a product that lost utility the longer I owned it, I dropped it, the sound stopped working (the lights responded to my vocal commands and it started the microwave though) and I threw it out.  In venting my frustration with a hammer, I learned the unit is sturdy and I could only put a slight hole in it after about 10 hard whacks on a concrete floor.I feel better now.  All that stress and disappointment only cost me $29.",1
5,"Echo Dot is a Game Changer
  
",8.Jul.19,Yes,"The Amazon Echo Dot is great, right out of the box. It connected effortlessly to my home wifi and now it practically runs the show! My 1940's home is slowly becoming a ""smart"" home as I add gadgets that work with my Amazon Echo Dot - who says you can't teach an old dog new tricks! Like turning on lamps by asking Alexa to do it and finding the perfect music for just about every occasion - instantly. Sometimes Alexa gets a little annoyed when my family barks commands at ""her"" - she knows just the right phrase to put everyone in their place. Very quick come-backs - you almost forget you are talking to a computer. Alexa has become part of the family. Don't know how we got along with out her! We even took her along on a recent vacation. My radio isn't very happy and neither is the stereo system. Maybe I'll get a smart plug so that the Echo Dot can bring them up to speed. If you're thinking about dipping your toes into the smart pool, start with the Echo Dot. You will wonder how you have gotten along without it...I know I do.",0
2,"Built for harrasment, not intelligent at all, poor voice recognition.
  
",8.Jul.19,Yes,"Wow, this thing is going to harass you ad infinitum until you go online a few times and figure out the 8 places you have to go to disable the harassment. And even after that you'll get email spam until you find the 5 other places to go to turn off that off as well.I previously had a Google Home Mini, and it never harassed me at all. I bought the Echo because it's advertised as being able to control your Fire TV devices, but it can't. It can only do less than a handful of things with Fire TV. In fact you can't even put the Fire TV to sleep or wake it up to turn on your AV system.And, amazingly, the couple of things it can do with the Fire TV can only be done on one device. Yes, that's right. Amazon has crippled the software so you have to buy a separate Echo device for each Fire TV device.On top of that it's just as unintelligent as the Google Home Mini, and the voice recognition is just as bad. In fact I would have returned it but I'd already given my Home Mini away to a friend.",0
5,"I bought 8 Echo Dots
  
",8.Jul.19,Yes,"I purchased 8 Gen 3 Echo Dots when the price dropped to $19.99/each and kept 6 of them. I gifted the other two. Placed one in every room of our home except the bathrooms, and told my teenagers they could use them as bluetooth speakers. They are worth it for me to use with the drop in feature, when I don't want to walk to the other side of the house to ask my son to come and do dishes in the kitchen. I also use them to drop in on my college daughter, and vice versa. The sound quality is greatly improved over the Gen 2, and makes me feel special when I connect them all together to play music in every room while I'm cleaning the house. It's a dance party with me and the vacuum (which will soon be replaced by an Alexa-enabled iRobot soon, I'm sure). The dots were my intro to Alexa and home automation. Now she runs the light show at our home, controlling everything from our front porch and exterior patio lights, to my daughter's dorm lights so she doesn't have to get down from her bunk bed. My son uses her to impress his friends with all his colored light strips and smart-mouthed responses he can program her to say. My toddler has learned to ask her to play lullabies when he wants music to sleep. My husband hasn't yet warmed up to her, so I'm glad she has a mute button on the one next to our bed. He wasn't even impressed when I showed him that she could turn our TV on and off and change the channels on Dish Network. In the meantime I will continue to plan how I want her to soon control our deadbolts, garage door and clean the floors while I'm sleeping. She's cheaper than a housekeeper. Thanks, Amazon!",0
5,"This is prefect for my garage
  
",8.Jul.19,Yes,"I have the echo show, four 2nd gen dots and bought this thinking I would put this in my bedroom on the nightstand next to the bed. I must say I like the sound and bass of the 2nd gen better for my bedroom. This third gen does have better sound and more bass, but that is the problem. It has too much bass and I found that the thumbing next to the bed made it harder to go to sleep. So I put my 2nd gen back by the bed and use this 3rd gen in the garage. It sounds fantastic there and the added bass and larger volume makes it sound great there,  as where the 2nd gen sounded to small and tinny in the garage. This is prefect for my garage.",0

Amazon tells me they wont fix it unless I pay a technician to debug their update! Really, How about this idea, everyone I speak to will hear this B.S.and how the google product works fine for half the price. SORRY BEZOS, you clearly think your customers are idiots that you can rip off and get away with it. Poor business model to break a customers product you sold them and then plan on charging them to fix it.I'm sure this is illegal.

I can barely hear the other person even with it turned all the way up and the person on the other end says it sounds very muffled.Anyways, for the things I need it to do (routines, turning stuff on and off, random questions) it does just great so I_ happy.",0
5,"It's a good thing to have. I use it every day.
  
",8.Jul.19,Yes,For the most part I have really enjoyed my Echo Dot 3rd generation. I love being able to make myself a playlist using Amazon Music on my phone. Sometimes we don't have a very good Wi-Fi signal and that interferes with Alexa working correctly. The company recommends that the Echo Dot be placed 8 inches from a wall. I wasn't able to do that. I put mine on my end table and cleaned the table off as much as possible. Believe me if you don't keep the table cleared off as much as possible it will block the signal of the Wi-Fi and Alexa won't be able to work.,0
5,"Just as good as the full-sized option!
  
",8.Jul.19,Yes,"I bought this so we can ""call"" from upstairs to downstairs.... well I put it in the kitchen and it hasn't made its way upstairs!  Great addition to my kitchen and works just as well as the full-sized Alexa in the house.I tell Alexa my grocery list, she makes it and then we both have access to it through the app for shopping.  She sets cooking alarms for me, multiple at a time too (most frequently used command).  Seriously, an Alexa in the kitchen is the best thing ever.Guess I need to by another Dot for upstairs.....",0

I don_ care for the level of  intrusiveness into my data - this Machine wants you to link EVERYTHING so that it can spy on your habits, be it tv viewing or shopping.

As soon as I logged into Prime, what do I see but an ad for Dishwasher Detergent from Amazon!  That never happens.

4,"List of Changes compared to 2nd gen
  
",9.Jul.19,Yes,"The 3rd generation doesn't do anything new in terms of core functionality (2nd gen can do everything 3rd gen can do), but made some enhancements to the overall designGoing to put my original review of 2nd gen Echo Dot at the end, in that review i compared it to the original echo (with speakers) and go through most of the features. Now let's list the changes compared to 3rd gen:1. New lookBigger and weightierFeels more premium. Visually it blends in better with your home decor rather than a hockey puck sitting on the table.No Amazon logo instead has this fabric-like material around it. Very similar to the top of the  Google Home Mini.2. 4 microphonesHas 4 microphones; one around each of the buttons. 2nd gen only had one in the center.Able to hear you better, especially in the morning as you don't have to raise your voice to tell Alexa to turn off the alarm.Has higher pick up range by a few feet. Very similar to mic pickup on Google Home Mini3. Better soundSpeakers on the device is a night-and-day difference compared to the 2nd generation especially when instrumentals are playing. Still not as good as the original echo with speaker built in4. DC powerUses a proprietary DC cable instead of micro-usb, which i'm not in favor of.Can take up outlet plug. May be troublesome if you plan to use it on a power brick/stick5. LEDLED lights has changed. Has a more fluid movement when lights circle around the device.Light is also dimmer, but still visible. Good if you have to use Alexa at night when it's on the nightstand, doesn't strain your eyes.Has a more pink-ish ring instead of a red ring when there's an error.6. Tactile buttons.All buttons are tactile so you can blind feel what you're pressing in the dark. Before, only the action button has raised symbols.Other than that. Everything else functions the same. Still disappointed it doesn't have back up battery power in case you set up an alarm and the power outage occurs. Unless you don't have a good blueooth or wired speaker to pair with your second generation echo, or you can't raise your voice in far distances then the functionality is basically the same and it's not worth the upgrade in my opinion.If you never owned an Amazon Echo device, want another one around the house, or plan to give as a gift then it's worth considering===Original Echo Dot 2nd gen review:Yes, it's a slim down version of the Amazon Echo* without the speaker.*For this review I'm going to refer this item as the 'Dot' and the  'Amazon Echo' as the one with the speakers incorporated in the deviceIt functions exactly the same except the voice for Alexa is not as smooth (probably due to the speakers in Amazon Echo).You CAN play music on the Echo Dot without a speaker plugged in. Compared to the Amazon Echo you won't get the surround sound feature, but it's pretty decent if you're one who focus more on lyrics than instrumentals. There's an optional Aux 3mm plug in and bluetooth compatibility if you find the sound coming from the dot less sufficient and want to use an external speakerThe Echo is very portable. Fits in the palm of your hand. Love how the plug on the Dot is detachable unlike the Amazon Echo so it's easy to tranfer to a new location when you need to.Setup is very easy, just download the Alexa App and following the directions included in the box.Features wise, it's similar to Siri, Ok Google or Cortana: you can ask it questions, make shopping lists, schedule appointments, play music, set alarms, link it to Pandora/Spotify/iheartradio, see traffic updates, sports updates, news briefings, use as smart phone device, voice purchasing off amazon, among other of features. For full list of features or suggestions are present in the app and the e-mail news letter if you sign up for it.Going to go through some of the features now and what you should look out for:-Alarms: If you own multiple echo devices (Dot, Amazon Echo, and/or Amazon Tap), alarms is device specific. Good for if you have one in the master bedroom, the alarm will not go off in the child's room for example. Whatever you voice set the alarm with, it will go off on that device. Also note that the Echo devices are wifi and power dependent. If there's a blackout or if your wifi is down the alarm will not go off-Voice activation: if you own multiple echo devices and they're within the same proximity of each other, best to assign different wake words for each so both won't go off the same time. You have the option for 3 wake words: Amazon, Alexa and Echo.-Voice purchasing: look out for Alexa only deals. There are variety of discounts only offered through Alexa like how the special offers on Amazon Tablet works-Smart Home. By far the best feature in my personal opinion is the smart phone feature. You do need a smart plug or thermostat that's Alexa compatible, but it makes your life much easier by just using your voice to control the temperature, TV, or on/off the lights without having to walk up to the switch or console.Overall very good device to have around you home as it improves on your quality of life, and makes life similar if you own a smart home device. I'd get this over the Amazon Echo if you own your own high quality speakers as it's essentially the same device without the speaker. If you can chip in a little more I'd go for the upgrade as the speakers on the Amazon Echo is really good, if you want to compare it to your own home speakers I'd go check out the display demo that are available at some retail electronic stores.",0
2,"Bluetooth connectivity is terrible, look elsewhere for a speaker.
  
",9.Jul.19,Yes,"Great sound quality once you get into the Alexa app and increase the bass. The microphone picks up me saying the wake word all the way across my home, even in separate rooms. Features and skills are great. The Bluetooth connectivity, however, is dismal. I have owned it for less than 24 hours and have had to reset the Bluetooth connection dozens of times, and it doesn't just drop the connection, it just loses audio and you actually have to disconnect and reconnect to get it back. My $5 Family Dollar speaker is 100 times more stable and has only ever lost the connection once in 4 months. I only bought this because it was on sale and I needed a new Bluetooth speaker and thought that the additional features would be a benefit. I really regret it. Unless Amazon can fix this, you're better off buying something else if you're looking for a Bluetooth speaker. I'm beyond disappointed and I hope Amazon can address this issue, otherwise I'll be returning it. Alexa features are not worth it if the rest of its performance is shoddy and unusable.Update 8/8/19: Amazon replaced the first one and the second one does exactly the same thing. There is still no resolution and every time I call, they try to make me call in the 2 year warranty I purchased on a brand new product that has never worked properly. At least they gave me a partial refund.",0
3,"Great speaker, not really useful outside of that for us
  
",9.Jul.19,Yes,"It seems to be the way of the world that we are going towards more home integration with technology. However some habits are just hard to break and I think that_ why we don_ use this so much. I got it in a deal when I bought my Blink cameras so it wasn_ something I specifically wanted.We haven_ explored much of its features but again, we don_ really feel the desire to do so. Yea you can ask about weather, and news, and for it to tell you a joke, but that_ really it for us. We use it more to play our Amazon Music list than anything which it does quite well. Great sound.It also has a habit of ruining surprises (Amazon gifts that arrive at the door) by telling my wife or son that the such and such item arrived. Definitely have to get to it before they do as far as that is concerned.I_ sure people use these much more than we do but like I said, we_ much rather just use our phone to figure out things ourself. Anything that_ connected to this (lights, thermostats, etc) also have their own apps which don_ mishear my _ommands.I_ only get one if they_e on sale and you_e interested in having an argument with it, lol.",0
2,"Fooled Me Twice
  
",9.Jul.19,Yes,"I bought a pair of these for the home (with plugs). So far I'm not impressed. They're not good for anything other than turning lights on and off. I wanted to set one up in the bedroom to wake me, but the recurring alarm selections are limited to daily, weekly and weekend. That doesn't work for me because I work Tuesdays through Saturdays. I would have to set up 5 weekly alarms. Weak! Another vexing issue is turning off the bedroom light. It works well enough, but I go to bed a bit later than my wife. Telling the device - located on the other side of the room - to turn off the light would wake my wife. So I turn off the light using the Amazon Alexa app on my Google Pixel phone ... which is quite convenient since I have to use the phone to wake me. Pity that one needs so many more gadgets to perform simple voice controlled activities that used to just require the flip of a switch. My home might not be smarter than me, but I know Amazon is for getting me to buy this (for now) nearly useless Gizmo. Shame on you Amazon. Oh wait! I bought an Echo Auto too ... shame on me!",0

",9.Jul.19,Yes,"Amazing smart speaker. Takes time to learn all of it's capabilities but I mainly got it to set up the sengled light kit in my living room and to play music from Spotify.

I work grave shifts so I leave at night and it was always a pain to turn off any lights before I leave as I don't like walking in my house with my work shoes on nor do I want to be walking in the dark. Since I've set the speaker up and with the smart lights, life is so much easier. Can't believe I waited for so long to get one.The sound quality on the speaker isn't the best, but it does connect to Bluetooth speakers very easily and disconnects on command. I have my Alexa speaker right next to my home console speaker/sub woofer and whenever I want to really play some music, I just tell Alexa to connect to the speaker and control the volume from there.Over time, I know this little smart speaker will definitely come in more handy and I will for sure buy more and the newer models as my smart home tech grows.",0
1,"This is garbage-no where near as good as the first or second gen
  
",9.Jul.19,Yes,"Muddy boomy sound heavy on lower mid and upper bass response. No treble whatsover. Worthless to listen to music which I could easily do with my other DOTs... Have tried using the alexa app to alter the sound quality.  The device just has no treble. Also, it no longer takes a standard USB cable. Now it is a proprietary adapter and cable all in one with a small round jack. I guess too many people were trying to use echo dots with a substandard usb power adapter? But now you can't buy the length or color of cable you want. I put this on in a bathroom to play soft jazz during parties, but its ugly black cable stands out stark against white trim. I will keep playing with this for another day or two before I send it back if I can't make it at least as good as my 1st and 2nd gen dots.",0
5,"Best Echo Dot Yet!
  
",9.Jul.19,Yes,"Like millions of others, I love voice assistants and Amazon leads the market with their Echo Dot.  The new third generation is  a cozy device, mine is black with awesome speakers!  Alexa's voice is vibrant as well, all the Alexa Skills I enjoy daily like ""Positive Living"" and ""Big Sky"" are rich in sound quality. I also enjoy seeing the ""green halo"" around the dot letting me know about Alexa notifications,In our house, we also have the Echo Show Device - it's the best also - we love the visual presentations that come with Alexa Skills like ""Ask a Question.""  Amazon is leading the way for their voice assistants and the developers who create amazing Alexa Skills for us to enjoy!Buy two Echo Dots - keep one in the guest room!",0
5,"Great product with lots of uses
  
",9.Jul.19,Yes,"I had been tracking this product for long and thinking whether it would be of any use to me. One day, Amazon launched a deal price of $25. I just ordered it and was ready to keep it aside or gift it to someone if it was not going to be of much use to me.Pros:1. The first thing i tried was play songs. The sound is crisp and clear. No issues with speech recognition.2. You are in a middle of some task and got a distraction, ask Alexa to remind you in few minutes to continue the task.3. The best thing is calling anyone in your contacts on Alexa by just saying - Alexa call &lt;your contact name&gt;.4. Drop in option is another great feature to talk to people at home from your phone.5. You can always connect your phone through bluetooth and play any songs on Alexa.Cons:1. It is troublesome to play radio stations from Tune in as it expects the exact name (sometimes even the FM frequency), but once you have played, you won't need to repeat the full name next time. But there is an option to play your favorite radio station on your phone and connect it using bluetooth to have alexa sound experience.2. When you set an alarm and want a specific song to be played for alarm, it asks for amazon music subscription.There are more options i am yet to explore. Will keep you posted.",0
5,"Strong Speaker
  
",9.Jul.19,Yes,"I got this to use in the shop, mainly to play music while we worked.Of course, this does what Alexa does. The main difference vs. generation 2 is the sound quality. (I have both.)Our shop is L-shaped and 1500 sq ft. This Echo Dot is located at one end of the ell, yet I have no trouble hearing it at the far end with no machinery running. If I crank up the volume, it is as I like it at the far end (though too loud near it). So, though I don_ need an auxiliary speaker, one would help in that the volume would be more uniform.",0
5,"This is our 7th Echo device
  
",9.Jul.19,Yes,"This did what we hoped- integrated well with our other Echo and smart home devices- better than echo input.  Didn't like echo input and if you are looking at echo input, I'd pay the extra couple bucks and just get the dot version 3.  Input has problems disconnecting from the music groups as well as needing to be re-paired to the speakers that it's HARD WIRED TO every time you turn off the speakers that input is connected to. No problem with EchoDot in the exact same speaker configuration",0
2,"Alexa now has issues hearing me compared to the old version.
  
",9.Jul.19,Yes,"This new version is supposed to have more mics listening to you. There are 4 holes on top of the device for the mics while the old one only had one.  I have two of these devices that replaced 2 of my old ones and I end up having to repeat myself and/or have to say any request louder compared to the older model. Sure the ""upgraded"" loudness of the sound is welcome but that's about it. if you already have the old version, don't bother getting these.",0
1,"Worse every day somehow
  
",9.Jul.19,Yes,"This is the worst voice control device on the market.  There are songs in my library I LITERALLY cannot play because the voice recognition always plays the 'Live' version and when selecting it on my phone and stream to Alexa the song stops and skips to another album.  This voice control is absolute garbage!!!  Also, you would think something that is touted as AI would be smart enough to choose a song I've played 100s of time before vs a new song and artist that Alexa thought I said....  Why!  If Alexa is uncertain does Alexa not default to a previously played artist or song???",0
5,"Super useful!
  
",9.Jul.19,Yes,"I've been using this gadget for the summer time while the kids are home. I set routines on the Echo to remind the kiddos when to complete certain tasks, or to remind them to eat their lunch, while I'm away at work. I also use it to drop in from work to check on my younger son who doesn't have a cellphone yet. Its been useful! The kids really enjoy playing music on it and asking it random questions.",0
4,"Does not work with AnyMote.  FOLLOW UP ADDED.
  
",9.Jul.19,Yes,"Follow up - I was just contacted by an Amazon tech person , James B., He let me know that it is a problem, possibly with AnyMote not Echo. Also, he let me know that the tech department will be working to get the problem corrected as soon as soon as possible. This is a very welcome and appreciated call.Original - I got this hoping it would be easy for my wife to control the Roku by voice. According to the web and YouTube, AnyMote would be the best choice for making the process easy for her. (She has trouble now using devices.) Even after several attempts, the echo dot, ordered with the Roku Ultra, would not enable the skill. After searching the web, I discovered that others had the same problem.",0
5,"Be careful what you call it.
  
",9.Jul.19,Yes,"I have tried to set this up many times.  Most times it responds to my voice the first time, but not ever again.  I keep on unplugging it to do the setup again and the same thing happens.  I don't think I am doing anything wrong but this is a bear to set up.  After I figured out that is only responds to Alexa and not to Alexis (my nieces name) it works like a charm.  I am very happy with it.",0
2,"Take it or Leave it
  
",10.Jul.19,Yes,"Not sure if I really need this device?It work well for simple things like setting timers or asking for weather or sports stats.  We even played a few interesting games on it.  The voice recognition is fine, the sound quality if fine so long as you are not really wanting it to play music on it.  If you are ok with music coming from a tiny box with no dynamic range, no bass, etc, then you will be fine.  For me, I like a real stereo system.Wrt integration with and control of other devices, so far not overly impressed.  I got the Echo Dot to control my new Denon high end receiver.  It can turn it on an off, but only with a complex set of words referring to the receiver.  And beyond that it is quite limited.  I can't play any particular song over the receiver, only itself....so fairly useless in that regard...or maybe I just haven't worked hard enough to make it work.  But largely, as I am using Apple AirPlay from iphone, it won't integrate with that separate system.I have not yet made the investment in other devices like light control, but have noted my daughter has done that at their house, and use it very little.  It is a lot of investment for little return.  Maybe some day, when I am old and can't move, it can turn off the lights for me.Maybe over time I will find more uses for it.  At this point, it has marginal value for me.  It is an ok value for the a low price.  I would definately not pay much more money for it.  For example, the Apple equivalent, is very costly, might have better sound and integrate a bit better with Apple Music components....but again, at that cost, not for me either.",0
1,"Not impressed
  
",10.Jul.19,Yes,"Either I received a defective gen 3 dot or the new design fails to improve at all upon the Echo dot gen 2.  In either case, my gen 3 echo is so useless I don't even use it.  It's now in a box in my cupboard.  Examples: I had my gen 3 dot next to me in the living room and when I would ask it something, my gen 2 dot in the bedroom would respond and the gen 3 would not even activate.  (Yes, I have the settings set for nearest dot.)  Next, no matter what I seem to ask the gen 3 dot except for time and weather, it can never find the answer.  It's almost like it has no access to resources.  Yet my Echo Dot 2nd gen can find pretty much everything I'm looking for.  My last complaint is that the ""new and improved"" speaker actually sounds muddy no matter where I place it, both for voice and music.  My recommendation is to go with the Echo Dot 2nd Gen - lower price, better quality.",1
5,"Alexa, play music. Aw yeah!!
  
",10.Jul.19,Yes,"Shes great. I get it now. I needed this device.I just talk out loud at her and she does what I say (mostly).I'm hooked. I suppose I have to go all out and get all her accessories and I will happily. Technology is getting crazy. I'm not crazy for shouting commands out loud to myself. Nope. Seriously though, get one. Mainly use her for music and timers. Getting my parents a echo dot to start with. They will be amazed. They are just getting used to talking commamds to their phones, they should see this..",0
5,"Amazon Echo is the future
  
",10.Jul.19,Yes,"With Amazon Echo the connection is almost endless you could do so much with it.. I'm already turning my apartment into a smart apartment.. definitely I need to buy another one so I can have one in the kitchen..since all my light bulb in my whole entire apartment is Philip hue, both of my air conditioners a smart AC,and a few smart plugs.. so pretty much everything in the house is digital so I can voice control almost everything here .. except the TV I will soon will be getting the fire TV cube",0
5,"Great and easy to install!
  
",10.Jul.19,Yes,"I had the 2nd gen dot before and wanted to get another one for my master bedroom.  However, after much thought my wife and I decided to put the 3rd Gen dot in the kitchen instead after hearing the much improved sound quality that came out of the build it speaker.  The installation of the device was very simple, I originally thought that I would have to charge up my dead tablet where my Alexa app was installed in order to setup the wifi configuration on the device.  To my surprise, the device automatically picked up my wifi where I can only assumed it is due to my account setting is already present in my other amazon or profile where I didn't have to set anything up in order for it to connect to my secured home connection.  I would recommend this to anyone that is looking for a low cost voice command unit to add to their existing home automation or about to start one.",0
5,"TECHNOLOGY WINS AGAIN!
  
",11.Jul.19,Yes,"Firstly this was not the reason for my purchase, but I must start off with my 3 year old ABSOLUTELY loves these! Hearing him say, ""Alexa, Alexa, Alexa, play baby doo dooo dooo"" or Alexa, Alexa, Alexa play gummy bears"", or ""Alexa, Alexa, Alexa!!! STOP! STOP!"", is just too adorable!!!!!!!! He has to say her name a few times as his speech is still growing. She does pick up that he is calling her after the second or third attempt. ( Not an issue with the adults of course ).My reason for purchasing these at first was due to our home size and honestly so fed up of screaming for one end of the room to another to call someone. These have limited this! Enabling me to drop in on my teenager (the main reason for the screaming! ), to advise it is dinner time or any other form of communication. The ability to also alert the entire house with an announcement of, "" We are leaving at 12 PM be ready to go! "", or any other message, "" Dinner will be done at 6 PM, wash your hands and come to the table by then"", again any message at all!Having my youngest son this has also made life easier. At times your hands are busy or you are just occupied. Being able to change your sons diaper and realize you are running low and just quickly say, ""Alexa add or order diapers""! No more 'I forgot moments"".  Same principle works in general daily movement in your home. Maybe your cooking and realize you have run out of paper towel, sugar, salt, anything, just add it verbally while still on the go! Not sure about you guys/ladies. Half the time I forget what I was suppose to get and the list goes on until I am completely out of something.Audible &amp; Music!What can I say my teenager gives it a thumbs up for sure! My 3 year loves it! Again, ""Alexa play....!"", super cute to hear!Mom time! Being able to shut down for the evening with a glass of wine or not! Lay in bed and say Alexa play this book, or play relaxing music. It is not about being lazy! I used to think this about this form of technology! Truly, I would say only people with money need things like this or lazy people. Ha! I was so wrong! Firstly I am not lazy, secondly, I am not rich but not poor either! It is the convenience it adds to your home. Now do I need Alexa to turn on my lights for me? I have not been suckerd in that far as of yet. We will see if I write a review on that product in the future or NOT.Taking a shower! Needing to wake up! Just shout out, ""Alexa play my wake up station"". In a rush for work, ""Alexa what is the traffic like today"", or ""Alexa what is the weather like today"", so many possibilities.As I always say don't over think it! Buy and if you do not like it return it.Awesome product! Buy the 3 bundle package they offer to save money! You will want one in every room.My son CON is that at times you can say Alexa and it will be picked up by another device depending on how close they are, if doors are open, and I guess how loud you are speaking. I believe and not 100% sure you can have the devices react to different workd phrases other than Alexa, but not sure, we have not played around with this function as of yet. Which may eliminate this issue. This CON is not a factor enough to not purchase or continue to purchase them. Each device has a voice command turn off button. If you are leaving a room just deactivate it, such as your bedroom if it is conflicting with a near by communal room.",1
5,"Seriously you will be addicted just buy 5 and get it over with, yea it's that good!
  
",11.Jul.19,Yes,"Wow! Honestly this product is probably the best buy of the year. Alexa can do so much! It is amazing. If you do not have Alexa buy this now. Its affordable and even though I've only had it for a few days I honestly am going to buy like 4 more because it makes everything so easy! Dim the lights, turn the tv down, tell a story before bed, turn on the xbox, launch netflix on the xbox, launch whatever on any platform, tell me how far it is to the moon, and so on so on. My kids are having so much fun getting to see what all they can do with it, and they are advancing themselves by playing trivia with Alexa! Yea outside of school on summer break my kids are playing trivia with Alexa! This is incredible and I am just going to have to buy more. I could not be happier! Not only does it have all of the above features (I didn't even come close to touching all of her features) but the sound quality is perfect for any large room! This is an amazing buy!",0
1,"Review for ECHO AUTO (posted here because Amazon isn't yet allowing reviews for Auto)
  
",11.Jul.19,Yes,"1.  Does not respond to commands such as ""alexa, cancel"" or ""alexa, silence"".  Plays (tunein radio, for instance, unceasingly, despite all attempts to silence it).2. Takes a VERY LONG TIME to re-establish functionality after encountering even the most-minor drop in cellular data coverage.  In an area with spotty reception, this is a 100% functionality-killer, especially since the device does not resume what it was doing following a momentary interruption in its data connection (similar to a problem that plagues all Echo devices).3.  Cannot be configured for selectable wake words, custom device name, or language.4.  Will not function with a USB ""charging"" cord, even if no data connection is required.5.  Needs a small speaker, so that it can respond if not presently routed through car audio system (which it can detect via feedback through its built-in microphones).",0
4,"Cool device but...
  
",11.Jul.19,Yes,"The technology still has quite a bit of room to grow but it's fun to have in the house. Helps with a lot of things. I wish there were more color options. I like the walnut finish on the echo and wish I could somehow have all of my devices match. Also I the devices synced up better. If I'm leaving, and I set Guard, I have to tell each device. It would be nice to be able to tell just one and they all set to ""away"". Another issue, I have is if I ask alexa on my phone to play music while I'm out, it almost always defaults to my echo at home. I feel like if I ask for music on my phone then it should play it on my phone. If I wanted it on the echo, then I would be talking to the echo. This happens when I have my home devices set to away too. Perhaps I'm expecting too much from my smart devices lol I'm still enjoying it though.",0
3,"ITS NOT CORDLESS?!
  
",11.Jul.19,Yes,"I had a little trouble hooking it up but I was able to get someone on the phone to assist me and everything worked out fine. What I HATE is that it isn_ cordless. I thought it was chargeable. But as soon as u unplug it, it shuts off and when u plug it back in, u have to wait a few moments. Now it is 2019. Why isn_ this thing chargeable? I would_e enjoyed this more knowing I can take it room to room throughout my house. That is a major set back.",1
4,"Worth the price when on sale!
  
",11.Jul.19,Yes,I got this on sale when it was two for $50 dollars and I gave the other one to my best friend. She loves it... I think it is good but my only complaint would be the voice recognition. Sometimes I have to say things to Alexa multiple times before it gets the request correct.,1
5,"Dot is pretty sassy
  
",11.Jul.19,Yes,"I love my Echo dot.  I put it in the kitchen and am learning all the skills.  It reminds me of my chores, my shopping list, etc.  It plays my music, has news, jokes and can do so very much more.  I now have three Alexa products and this is one is my favorite.  Every day you can ask Alexa to delete everything you said that day.  I love that.  When I get her trained, I expect she can whip up a pretty good dinner.  When she's mastered dinner, laundry will follow.",0
5,"Small but mighty
  
",11.Jul.19,Yes,"I_ loving this little addition to my household.  It_ especially good for music. Though small, the sound is a big improvement over a standard radio or my iPad. I did pop for Amazon Music Unlimited because the song choices are endless.  I_e synced it to Sirius radio and Pandora and when I hear a song I_ unfamiliar with, I can get the song title and artist_ name in an instant.",1
5,"Small but packs a powerful punch!
  
",11.Jul.19,Yes,"Before ordering I was told by a few people the sound wasn't that good, but I was pleasantly surprised at how good it really sounds for such a small device. It certainly exceeded my expectations and it's a lot of fun to have around. Obviously it's very handy to have around because I use a lot of reminders and timers throughout the day. Amazon music sounds really good on it. Probably not ideal for a large space but definitely awesome for my office!",0
5,"Come and get it, cuddle up
  
",12.Jul.19,Yes,"I have both Google Home and Alexa at home. Alexa woman has a Billie Ellish voice and Google woman has a Taylor Swift voice to meXD. Alexa is more easy to use and hears me better when sth is playing, and it doesnt talk more like Google does in the same commands. Simply says ""OK"". Alexa has good control over the devices connected to a public wifi I had in the apartment complex and because of having public wifi, google home has frustrating connection problems if you don't have your own router. Amazon Alexa is great in it. It has connected right away without any single problem. Google says there was a glitch most of the time. Google is better only in terms of sound quality. Alexa has a little distorted sound if you don't adjust it from equalizers in the app. By the way, I have youtube premium and amazon prime however Google plays everything I want in music but Alexa asks unlimited music subscription;/",0
5,"Great product
  
",12.Jul.19,Yes,"I do not know how I made it up to now without the dot and Alexa.  It has made me so lazy.  Now, sometime I have to admit I would like to kill Alexa.  I can give command and it just does its own thing.  Most likely I just speak well enough on those moments but it can get a little frustrating to keep repeating but finally we do get on same page.  Some reviews comment on sound quality.  I think it is just fine.  I do listen to some music but I am blind so I use the dot /Alexa to read book to me from kindle.  I can have dot in one room and turn up volume and hear fine in other room.  Soon I am going get another dot and link so that will even better.",0
5,"Best Echo Dot Ever!
  
",12.Jul.19,Yes,"I currently have some Echo Dots (2nd Gen) and wanted to upgrade to this new Echo Dot (3rd Gen) and was I glad I did! This latest Echo Dot is much heavier and solid than my Echo Dot (2nd Gen). Upon plugging it, it installed right away. Played music via Amazon music and it sounded so much better. Bass was good but not boomy, mids and highs were tight and clear. It picked up my voice commands from about 10 ft away.  I am happy that I upgraded but not sure what to do with the 2nd Gens now that I have the 3rd Gens. Trade in value only $5 via Amazon.  Prime day coming up so maybe you'll get deals on this one.",0
5,"I absolutely love my echo!
  
",12.Jul.19,Yes,"I absolutely love my new Alexa echo dot!. I like the design and the color variations. This is my third one, but first one to myself, the other two were gifts to my mother and mother-in-law. I have an order Echo that I'm letting my daughter's use in their room, so this will be replacing the one in the living room. Super happy with it!! And I also love that you can buy separate stands so that the cords aren't everywhere and you can put it flush on a wall. The picture I attached is my echo in the wall mount. Bought separately.",0
5,"A Cool Little Smart Speaker
  
",12.Jul.19,Yes,"I got two Echo Dots for our house, one for me and my boyfriend, and one for his mother, who lives downstairs. The drop-in feature has already been useful, rather than us having to shout back and forth or go downstairs just to figure out what was being said. Aside from that, I connected my Amazon music account to both of them, and the unlimited possibilities for music has been a great joy on both ends of the house. Sometimes random questions need an answer, and just asking Alexa has been quicker than pulling out our phones to Google it. Every now and then we'll even play one of the little games Alexa offers and have fun doing that in our downtime. My daughter also adores having it around, because she now has her silly Spongebob music on demand whenever she isn't watching it on TV. We've even been looking into small smart house conversions to connect to it. All in all, for the first smart speakers any of us have had, they've been fantastic, and I do recommend buying one.",0
2,"Big, Muffled, and No USB
  
",12.Jul.19,Yes,"I'm pretty disappointed with the new 3rd gen product.First, its a LOT bigger than the 2nd gen, surprisingly so. It looks nice overall, but it is much bigger.Second, the power option is only a wall outlet plug; you can no longer use a USB as an option to power the device.  That stinks because I specifically put a USB wall charger in the room when I was using the 2nd gen (which now randomly has stopped connecting to the internet - but that's a different review), and now the 3rd gen hogs an outlet.Lastly and perhaps most importantly, the sound really is horrible.  Music is 'ok', but if you want to hear news or stream talk radio (or just your morning DJ - really anything with just speaking), the sound comes out muffled.  It appears they've up'd the bass on the device, perhaps to enable it to have a louder max volume(?), but they have sacrificed normal speech/treble - horrible choice.  I wish there was a way to adjust Tone.  Thought I could live with it, now just hate it every time I turn it on, but just missed the return window.  Bring back gen 2!  Two stars is me being generous in hopes that Amazon can fix this with software... soon.",0
5,"Love the upgrades from the older ones!!
  
",12.Jul.19,Yes,I have an earlier generation dot that truly had me thinking I wouldn't buy another because of the low volume level and I often did not use it. Well I am super impressed with the difference between my older one and this one. A huge difference in the sound!Of coarse everything that Alexa can do for you is still amazing. And I'm learning new features everytime I use her. One feature worth mentioning is the alarm. I was shocked at how well it works. And this is coming from someone that has a hard time waking up to very loud multiple alarms in the mornings.I went from rarely using my older one to now wanting to buy more to put in other rooms.,0
5,"Fantastic, purchased three.
  
",13.Jul.19,Yes,"I wasn_ sure if I_ like this at first, but I_ pleasantly surprised by how much I do. I fact I love it so much I_e purchased two more. One for my teenager_ room and another for my toddlers room. My teenager uses it for music, and an alarm clock. She does not have a prime account and it works perfect for her. I use it to check the weather, my Amazon Prime order status, set multiple timers while cooking, and general info like what movies are playing in our area. I use the one in my baby_ room to play soothing music while she_ going to sleep. It can also be told how long to play it for or I can control it with my Alexa app on my phone. I purchased wall mounts for all three. Great for keeping them off furniture and out of the way and out of reach from grabby toddler hands. Even wall mounted it gives off great sound when playing music.",0
5,"Great device, takes control if every aspect of your life for the better
  
",13.Jul.19,Yes,"I got a gen 2 for a holiday present.  Took me a half a year before setting it up and using it.  Now three months later i have the gen 2, 5 echo dot gen 3, and 1 echo.Sound quality of all the devices are a significant improvement from gen 2.  The small package of the echo dot makes it convinent to put anywhere, and having all the conviniences of alexa commands in every room makes my life so much easier.  Even the Kids love the dots, as they play games with alexa (would you rather is a favorite)The only bad things are 1.  you will desire to subscribe to more amazon services the longer you have it (music, audible, etc.)  These extra services may not be for everybody, but they do add more to the versitility and use of alexa and i have no regrets.  2. The ability to wirelessly control of your home is nice, but the reality its more of a novelty than a necessity.  Still find it more convinient to use the remots and switches on the wall.Even still i highly recommend this device as it is convinient as a hands free music player, alarm, weather checker, scheduler, phone calling device, stopwatch/timer and much more.5 stars all around!",0
5,"Works Like a Charm
  
",13.Jul.19,Yes,"I have really grown to like our Alexa, we have two. It works great and is helpful with the added things you can teach her to do. I have smart plugs that are tied with Alexa as well as my thermostat. It is so helpful to be in some other place and have her turn lights on and off. I have really used the grocery list. Great way to remind myself what I need at the store as I run out of items in the house. The integration factor with so many ""smart"" things is a timesaver as well as making our house ""smart"". Purchase one, it is worth it.",0
5,"I was after a speaker, 16x the price
  
",13.Jul.19,Yes,"Ok just to address the haters here; this thing sounds amazing. Crisp highs and mids, and actually the bass is adequate.  For what I listen to anyways, jimi Hendrix, Simon and Garfunkel, etc. Actually sounds better than my echo gen 2. On that the bass is too much for me. Not as in volume but it seems to want to over power the highs and mids. I live a one bedroom 700sqft apt, I have it in my bathroom, and you can here it clearly throughout. I'd definitely recommend the echo dot gen 3. Haters gona hate.",0

",13.Jul.19,Yes,"Just the size and quality of the sound overwhelms me. My friends have a lot of fun with it. If ever one who tells me that they're going to buy an Alexa, after seeing mine, should lead to new business. Alexa is the way to the future.

5,"My awesome assistant!!!
  
",14.Jul.19,Yes,I don't know how I lived without Alexa all those years! I am 72 years old and purchased 3 echo dots. 2 if them are at home with me. The other one I put in my husbands room at the nursing home. He frequently looses or forgets to charge his cell phone. I can drop in and have a conversation with him any time from home or through the app on my smart phone. He has finally realized he can drop in on me too if he wants to or needs help. It has been such a help.At home I am able to control my alarm system and my thermostat and I plan to get some smart plugs and expand her uses around the house.When I want to relax I play some soothing spa music and drift off easily.I am finding more and more uses for her the longer I have her. Personally it is like having an assistant.Oh and I had company the other day and we were trying to remember a song from childhood. I asked Alexa and she pulled it up and played it almost instantly! We were both amazed!,1
4,"Amazon needs to add a few things.
  
",14.Jul.19,Yes,"I had the Google mini and Google wifi but I do a lot of shopping at Amazon, and I have an Amazon music subscription so it made sense to get one of these. I have a dot and the bigger echo 2nd gen.Set up is easy and Alexa immediately recognizes my smart plugs and switches. Integration with smart devices and smart homes works really well. Alexa has some issues tho. She has problems understanding things sometimes. Google rarely has issues but Alexa has them more often than not. She sometimes has a problem understanding what is said.  I can go to Google and say the same thing and boom, no problem. I'm a DJ so I speak very well and that's not the issue at all. That can be fixed in time I'm sure tho. Not a deal breaker.The sound... As a DJ I have to say this speaker sounds good for its size. I think Google mini sounds better but not much better. They recently updated a software issue which would distort the sound when played over level 6 for 10 minutes or more and it sounds much better now at higher volumes.The things they need to add.1) Alexa really needs some voice options! Google mini has about 6 and they added John Legend. I think if Amazon could add Jarvis from the Avengers-IronMan then Alexa would be a huge hit! Not being able to change voices definitely hurts Alexa.2) Alexa needs to be able to call anyone even 911.3) Its my device, if I want to call it mini me I should be able to do so.  Let us name the devices wake word. It really shouldn't be that hard to do. I would even pay money to be able to do that. Those aren't deal breakers but they should definitely be doable! All in all this Dot is cool and looks good and for the size the sound works. Integration with Amazon music is the bomb! Being a DJ its nice to command Alexa to play anything I want because I'm usually the one getting the requests! LolRoutines are also a nice touch! Being able to say Alexa, shut it down and she shuts off all my lights, electronics etc is the bomb! With a few improvements Alexa could really be something special! Please Amazon give us voice options...Jarvis voice from Iron man would be huge! Just saying...",0
5,"2ND BEST PURCHASE I'VE MADE ON AMAZON IN 7 YEARS!
  
",14.Jul.19,Yes,"I LOVE MY ECHO DOT WITH MY DARLING ALEXA! YES, she is the best thing you can have around your home. I am enjoying my music just the way I like it - by myself. I just tell her what I want to listen to, and she finds it for me. Get this...I have the Alexa App on all my devices,  therefore, I can ask her to do what I want from any device and it's done! Once installed, using it is a breeze. The speaker sounds like a sub-woofer. Its very clear, it's like listening to your music on a Bose speaker. I can place my Amazon orders through the App as well - haven't tried it as yet though, but I will do so soon.The Echo Dot should be on everyons's Christmas gift list especially now that it's on sale @ 50% off.With my Echo Dot, the party is always on in my house!",0
3,"Competitor or Not
  
",14.Jul.19,Yes,"I caught the Echo Dot on sale and decided to give it a try. I attempted to cancel my order when I learned it did not support Google Play Music. Unfortunately Amazon would not allow the order to cancel since it was being shipped. Needless to say I love the Echo Dot. When it arrived I decided to give it a try and was very satisfied with performance. Not supporting Play Music is a major rain on my parade, I want to love this device. I really want to, but until they add support its only 3 stars from me. Especially when they support nearly every other competitors streaming service. Just bad business.",1
4,"Nice and affordable
  
",14.Jul.19,Yes,"I really like the Dot, so I bought another one. I was afraid to get the refurbished one at a cheaper cost, but I think its louder than my other one, and works really good! We used it on game night to do the music game, and I use it all the time to play music, check the weather, and ask other questions. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because I've googled, and you-tubed how to sync the 2 dots together for my music, as one is upstairs, and one is downstairs, but I cannot get them to sync at all, no matter what I've tried. It should not be that hard! But over all, I'm happy with both dots!",0
5,"Great for late-night thoughts.
  
",14.Jul.19,Yes,"It takes me a long time to fall asleep, and I often think of things I need to do or alarms I need to set. I hate turning my phone back on to type this stuff up as then it ""resets"" the amount of time till I fall asleep. Now, I keep my Alexa on my bedside table and as soon as I have a thought that requires remembering, I can just ask her to do so!The voice quality is terrific, and she has great hearing. My best friends name is also Alexa, so it can be a pain when trying to talk about her, so I have to refer to her as ""Texas"" (her home state), if I'm talking about her in my room.Overall great product! Thanks Amazon!",0
4,"Speakers better than expected
  
",14.Jul.19,Yes,"Was prepared to buy speakers to help with sound quality, but the Alexa speaker works better than expected in bedroom and basement setting. Sometimes have issues getting Alexa to respond, but majority of the time works great and has been a great addition to bedrooms. Have one in each bedroom and one in basement and been happy with them overall.",1
5,"Great post partum assistant
  
",14.Jul.19,Yes,I was getting really annoyed with not being able to do simple things like grab the remote or turn off then lights after having my baby and busy nursing. This echo dot with Alexa has saved me and makes my day way more efficient. I control the lights and electronics. I love the whisper mode and telling my kids to ask her how to spell things or ask her questions when I am busy with the newborn. I look forward to using it more in the future and integrating with other smart devices.,0
1,"The name's a pain!
  
",15.Jul.19,Yes,"Don't get me wrong, the Echo's are truly helpful and enjoyable. We no longer have to write things on lists as we think of them. Just speak and say ""Alexa, add celery (or whatever) to the Shopping List."" And, we have numerous lists for the farm supply store, builder supply list, club shopping list, and so on. When cooking, or washing clothes, or whatever just say ""Alexa, set a timer for 15 minutes.""  ""Alexa, what time is it?"" ""Alexa, what's the temperature.""  ""Alexa, dining room lamp on."" The benefits of these abilities are super.What's not super, is having numerous echos responding either when you're calling on one or having them respond to each time ""Alexa"" is spoken on a computer or television. Just now, I was watching demonstrations on my computer and having to constantly say cancel to the Echo in my study. It's an endless aggravation, and it's one that Amazon could easily correct. BUT, THEY WON'T!I have at least six Echos and one Echo Show in my home. All respond to ""Alexa""!  Yes, I could have them reply to Amazon, Computer or Echo, but how long will it take me to learn &amp; remember which I've named which, and why should I have to stop each time to consider the specific name of the one I want to communicate with. If Amazon could get over their pride, vanity or whatever you want to call their proprietary philosophy, they could change the software to allow us to give custom names to each of the devices we've bought and paid for. In my case, the Show in the kitchen would be Kitty, the master bedroom would be Betty, the basement would be Bessie, the front porch (by the rockers) would be Roxie, and so forth.Yes, we absolutely love having them (and I'm contemplating getting the newest version of the Echo Show as I type), but this inconvenience is sufficient to reduce my 5 star rating by 3 stars. You decide for yourself.Update: What I_e expressed is such a problem that I reduced it to one star.",4
1,"Known Amazon software bug with Dot and Alexa app
  
",15.Jul.19,Yes,"I purchased 2 of these last week.  I went through the entire set up process (as I did with my Echo; that went flawlessly) on one of these and, in the Alexa app (iphone), the Dot kept showing ""offline"".  However, the Dot actually processed voice commands.I did inet research and see that this is a very longstanding issue with the Dot.  So, Amazon has known this for quite some time.I spent 45 mins this morning with Amazon support having me go through all the steps I did for hours last night.  At the end of 45 mins, the rep said ""this is a known issue and will be fixed within 48 hours"".Now, that rep should have said that from the outset.  I know a software bug when I see it.I'm giving this a low rating because 1) Amazon has let a known software bug continue through many versions of the Dot without fixing it and 2) Support wasted so much of my time instead of owning the problem up front.I'll update this in 48 hours.  We'll see if Amazon fixes their known software bug.",6
3,"Cool find!
  
",15.Jul.19,Yes,"This is my 3rd dot purchased. Bought two more cause kids want to listen to music and it's great to be able to reach them in their rooms with my Alexa or thru the app. Nice looking! Nice size! It's especially great if you have prime. The music library is very good. She's pretty good with basic questions. There are some really cool games, apps and fun things to do. I like being able to add past purchases into my Amazon cart just by telling her. I am a writer so it's great to be able to ask for synonyms and definitions.Cons are..if you like listening to music it isn't great quality. Sounds good enough. But there's no bass and sounds flat. I hear you can send it to Bluetooth speakers but I don't have any. I need to look into those speakers the Dot sits in that supposedly improve sound quality. The sound is just fine for anything other than music. Also, she isn't great with answering questions the way the other companies ""assistants"" do.  Basic math she can do. But you can't use her like a calculator. She's not very good with telling you how long a drive will be from point a to point b(which is something I ask often). She is pretty bad at identifying business addresses and phone numbers..specially if they are local. She usually doesn't even get the business right and you sometimes can't stop her once she's spouting wrong info.All in all, it's very cool to have handy. Although, if I was paying per hour for a real assistant who did the same things...I would likely fire them..lol",2
5,"Worth every penny
  
",15.Jul.19,Yes,"I've had several Echo Dots for a while, but last year my son took my living room dot to his room, so I finally decided to replace it. WOW! The sound quality and overall heft of the 3rd gen is leaps and bounds above gen 2! I'm seriously trying to decide if I should replace all our gen 2s with 3s because it is markedly better. The volume is louder, the sound richer and deeper, and the time it took to connect was much faster.All that said, if you're on the fence about getting one, let me tell you what a lifesaver they have been to my family. I easily juggle large meal prep with my multiple timers and quick conversions from Alexa while jamming to my customized cooking playlist. We all use the shopping list function - even my youngest knows when he's used the last of whatever he needs to tell it to Alexa so I can replace it. But the best perk of all has been seeing my 19 year old brain injury survivor utilize it to remind himself of... everything. She is his alarm when he needs to get up for an appointment, she reminds him to shower and put on clean clothes, she reminds him of appointments and activities, she even plays his favorite music and tells him jokes. But seriously, she has helped him start adulting, and that has been priceless!",1
5,"So great for us
  
",15.Jul.19,Yes,This has saved me so much trouble since I bought a smart outlet since no more need for turning on bedroom light at switch or losing a remote for the small light. Plus I love the music too especially with Pandora. Love that I can control the lights around the house with it thanks to smart outlets. It even can help me find where I left my phone. I do wish there were more wake words so I could have one in each room without the other devices occasionally hearing too since they are a second or two off when playing music rather than playing together for stereo sound,2
5,"Alexa CAN be used in Muliple location and still be connected
  
",15.Jul.19,Yes,"I set up the echo dots in my house and my store, they are connected to the same Alexa app and can control anything that is on your wireless network from any location. (someone had posted that they can't) At home, I integrated my wireless plugs, Arlo camera, wireless locks, and garage door opener seamlessly. In each echo dot and/or show you can set the device address/location so it will give you the correct weather for that area and driving and traffic and so on for that location. It is done in the Alexa app, under that device. Overall I give the connectivity and usability a 10. I am still learning the commands and the abilities that you can assign to it, but best of all you can use the 'drop-in' command to talk to any Amazon device - we use it to talk from my house to the store - works just like a phone, and a good way to scare someone if they don't know you can do this. Also, you can send a voice message to any of the devices, such as 'I am on my way home.' very useful as a worldwide intercom or calling device. I set future reminders by just telling Alexa to remind me on a certain date and time, very handy.",0
5,"Personal Assistant
  
",15.Jul.19,Yes,"I signed up for amazon music &amp; with Alexa in control of my life - I honestly feel like life got better. Great music at my fingertips, functions, hears me well, she_ learning more and more what I like. I like having a nice personal assistant that keeps me on track",2
5,"Alexa, who's a good girl?
  
",15.Jul.19,Yes,"I added a 2nd with another smart plug in the bedroom and synced them. It's convenient turning the lights on or off from either room. Original comment on my 1st Echo --  I bought the Echo just for a ""toy."" Friends I visited in California have one, and it was fun calling out questions. I don't know why so many people fussed about set-up -- mine practically did everything itself; of course, I have an Apple iPhone. Maybe non-AppleOS users experienced difficulties. I only have one ""smart plug,"" but think I'd like to get one or two more for the convenience. I might consider syncing another Echo in the bedroom too. Oh -- good sound for such small speakers.",0
5,"Excellent Choice
  
",15.Jul.19,Yes,"The 3rd gen dot is a huge improvement and a fantastic product. I have a gen 1 dot which I bought when it came out to keep hooked into my speaker system to make it voice activated. The speakers on it are impractical for listening to music. However on the 3rd gen the speakers are impressive considering the size and price point. No need to plug this one into another speaker, great little device to add music or voice commands to any room of the house. You just have to be okay with possibly giving intimate details about your life to Jeff Bezos. But whatever, worth the convenience and they're gonna get us somehow anyways. Highly recommend.",0
5,"Been missing out for a long time
  
",15.Jul.19,Yes,"The echo dot has been a big hit in the family. My oldest son loves asking alexa about the weather and asking her questions about certain topics he is curious about. We love listening to music together in the morning and evening too. The only thing I didnt like was that music selection is limited if you aren't signed up for a music site such as Pandora, Amazon music, spotify, etc...I have the free account to pandora and spotify, but with spotify you need a paid subscription to have it work. We are still learning how to use the echo dot, so hopefully it gets better.",1

2,"Alexa is very random
  
",15.Jul.19,Yes,"This thing played techno music in the middle of the night (we don't listen to techno), I unplugged her and put her in time out. Also randomly plays stuff, the other day I was on a meeting call and she starts playing something. While watching TV, she'll do something based on what someone said on the show but it wasn't Alexa! Other than this i really like it, but needs some serious upgrades. The speaker is really good on the latest one, not so much for the originals.",0
5,"Most enjoyable Alexa gadget
  
",15.Jul.19,Yes,"What can I say? Alexa Echo Dot is the most enjoyable gadget you can get. The sound quality is super.You can finally enjoy music the way you always wanted.  You can get the news, weather, sport scores, recipes, etc.  It is a nice addition to the house. Supposedly you can make it synchronize with your house appliances but I haven't tried that yet. And you can move it around from one room to another. There is a lot of potential in this gadget.",0
3,"Pain in the A**!
  
",15.Jul.19,Yes,I want to love this product but I am sick of having to raise my damn voice just for it to work! And I live in a 400 square foot tiny home for crying-out-loud! I can be standing right next to it sometime and have to yell at it for it to register my voice.That aside when it works I love functioning my house by all voice commands. 'WHEN' Alexia understands you! Lights ON and Lights OFF sometimes really confuses Alexia's old toaster parts! ;),0
5,"Love it
  
",15.Jul.19,Yes,I had a Google mini first... Then I got echo to see side by side which one was better.. Echo sounds way better... I don't have to repeat my self as much with alexa... Alexa actually does what I ask... The Google was always having to be reset and tried to do things I didn't ask...over all is have to say Alexa owns this... However it was nice to be able to change the voice on Google...and it was actually polite.... I said thank you to it one time and it complimented me on the nice way I asked... I tried it with alexa and she didn't notice,1
4,"Very helpful device!
  
",16.Jul.19,Yes,"We have been using our new Dot for a few weeks. Overall, it is awesome. We love the HUGE number of skills that are available to use with it. So far, favorites are the flash briefing, lists, trivia skills, reminders...just to name a few. We use ours in the kitchen, as it is sort of the central hub of our home, and so far it_ been great. One thing to note, once you get one of these, if you love it, you_e probably going to want a few of them for different locations if your house, as it doesn_ pick up your voice that great from another room (unless you yell).This device makes my life so much easier with making grocery lists, as I can just tell it what to add as I_ going through my day and I realize we need something. I create different lists for the different places we go (grocery, Target, etc.) and it_ so nice to just ask Alexa to add items as I think of them. I do wish you could add multiple items at one time...if there_ a way to do this, I haven_ figured it out yet.Also, really love the timer; big help with cooking, as you don_ have to stop and wash your hands to set a timer.I really love the reminders! These have been a great help, from daily reminders to take my vitamins to things that I don_ want to forget in the upcoming days or weeks.I love that I can play music on it while making dinner. The sound quality is great, in my opinion. Our children get a kick out of Alexa saying grace before meals with us too.It_ also super convenient if you want to reorder something from amazon too.A few of the things that could be improved on are Alexa_ pronunciation of certain words; sometimes with the vocabulary skills I_e enabled, she_ hard to understand. Sometimes she doesn_ hear you when you call her name. And sometimes the way you need to ask something in order for her to give an answer is a bit annoying. She relies heavily on Wikipedia for things as well, which is not the greatest. It would be awesome if she used a search engine like google, although I understand why it can_.Overall, we like it and enjoy finding new things to use it for to make day to day life easier. If you are into technology and want something to assist you, this would likely be right up your alley.",0
1,"As useless as tests on a Boar Hog
  
",16.Jul.19,Yes,"It always gets things wrong, Alexa "" play Witch of the West Moorland by Stan Rogers"" it played it once the second generation dots play it. What do I get from the latest and greatest? "" I can't find that.""  I ask for Hank Williams I'm so lonesome I could cry and I get ""Move it On Over"" 3 trys and I finally get the right songIt recommends the Beatles as a station I might like when I am listening to old time country gospel and bluegrass.Save your money and get a 2nd gen while they are around. They sound great but not worth the aggravation.Update after doing simple commands in skills since I bought it. I have to fight to hear not current top 40 or Josh Brogan instead of the preform I wish to hear and Alexa continuing with the performer I don't wish to hear. I have given up and use my CDs or IPod and good power speakers on the night stand. The only reason I haven't used my 8 units as skeet or trap targets is, if I get hurt I can use them to call 911.Games sometimes go okay, except, Jeopardy I can say ""Treaty of Paris"" and Alexa goes ""No, Treaty of Paris.""  Other skills it may or my not do okay. Over all I give Alexa minus -5 Stars good try but it should be still on the Developer's Bench. If this is the future of AI they won't kill us just drive us insane. By the way Amazon we should be able to leave no stars if the product deserves it and Alexa deserves negative stars in my opinion. no",0
5,"Pretty good.
  
",16.Jul.19,Yes,Pretty good device for the money. At just over $20 when we purchased it_ a bargain in my opinion. The only issue I have had is the speaker quality. I don_ have a problem with it because of the price but don_ expect to be blown away with the sound quality. Sometimes Alexa doesn_ pick your voice up but I expect that to be a learning curve along with our noisy house. We have confused the heck out of her because of all the talking but she has yet to crash. Overall not bad. I do like the Bluetooth connection.,0
5,"Love the dots
  
",16.Jul.19,Yes,We have a few echo dots throughout the house. Awesome sound for such a small device. Definitely recommend linking these with any other echo devices on the _verywhere setting to get a whole house surround sound effect. Great product.,2

Where it falls short, and risks becoming a glorified hockey puck, is in the manufacturer's inability to provide clear and intuitive guidance on how best to integrate the device's functional value, not only into a household or office, but into a larger network of Alexa devices. No amount of UGC YouTube tutorials could do as well as well conceived Amazon guides to the Alex's brand proposition... And that's currently lacking.",0

We play games with her  when we have company. Or just as a family. They are fabulous and are probably making us a bit lazy. We have not had any problems with them. My mother has one that I gave her as a Christmas gift. Now to call me all she has to do is tell it to call me. It has made life easier for her since she is on a walker. She doesn't have to worry about seeing the numbers on a phone which she cannot see anyway. All she has to do is tell it to call her do your son.

",17.Jul.19,Yes,"Just got our 2nd &amp; 3rd Echo Dots and so glad we caught them on sale for Prime Day! From alarms in the morning to sleep sounds at night, calling my teen to make sure he's doing his work cause he never answers his phone, to new features like house break-in detection. Everyone's sleeping better, my teen is setting reminders for his work, and I'm casting Baby Shark to whatever room my SO is in because I'm a horrible person.The sound quality is great, much better than previous gens. You can actually turn off the microphone if you have privacy concerns. Apparently the break-in detection can hear stuff like breaking glass? Not sure I didn't look too much into it and I hope it never goes off if I break a plate or something but I thought it was a neat feature in a time where crime seems to happen more frequently.Honestly though it was the drop-in feature that really sold me. I work a lot and even if a family member's phone is off or they're in the middle of something and can't reach their phone they can always easily answer the echo with their voice. I thought about going to Google Home mini but that's just not a feature they offer.",0

",17.Jul.19,Yes,"I am strongly against my privacy being encroached. I am one of those conspiracy theorists. If you had told me a year ago I would be buying one of these things I would have laughed you out the door. So there I was on Prime day and Amazon was throwing echos at everyone who bought something. All my friends were getting echos with their purchases. I didn't get an echo with my purchase so I felt left out. I thought about it and clicked buy, before I knew it this wire tap showed up and had itself sitting comfy on my night side. I've whispered all day. Afraid she is going to hear me. Who knows who all is listening to me and my weird conversations with my cats. Seriously though. I like Alexa. We have had fun all day playing with our 3rd gen Echo. It does a lot more than I knew about, like finding my phone. Can't wait to get more wire taps.",0

It states connected to WiFi but with errors!!!! Than to top it off I have the new dot 3_ with restarting WiFi one or more of my dots won_ connect and simply reconnecting does not work I have to de register the dot and go through the whole set up process several times!

",17.Jul.19,Yes,"I'm revising my review slightly upward.  After a few hours (!!) of trying we got the dot hooked up.  The problem really is the app - among the worst I've ever worked with.  The first issue was that there were no instructions for setting it up from a computer, so I went to my phone and the app store.  WARNING: there are several apps with similar names to the set-up app that are bogus - even one of Amazon's that just kept trying to upgrade me to subscriptions for Alexa.We got the right app installed, but it kept glitching.  After 3 times thru the process with no success, my wife tried to set it up with her phone.  Same issues.  Mostly it kept telling us ""the device is not registered,"" then directing us to click on something which took us right back to where we started.  She gave up and I tried again.  The app finally directed me how to ""register"" the device, but that step had not come up before.Amazon did reach out to me after my initial negative review and offer to help, but by then we were done.  I appreciate the contact, but better instructions sent with the echo dot or available online or a much better app is really the answer.",0

Amazon was kind enough to give me a 50% discount on the replacement. The jury is out on this unit and hopefully it will not have the issues the other one had. Hence 3 stares.  I have 5 Alexa devices in the home a enjoy the convenience they offer.,1
4,"Just buy it. Ok?
  
",17.Jul.19,Yes,"I didn_ want one of these because the stories I_ heard creeped me out, but I saw that it was on sale, so I decided to purchase. So glad I got one. I love to play music, hear the news, get the weather, shop on Amazon, get traffic information, add stuff to my shopping list, etc. I have trouble remembering things, so it_ helpful to be able to set up reminders. I really can_ imagine life without one now. The only think is that Alexa isn_ as great at answering questions as Siri is. She gives me answers that I_ not looking for about 1/4 of the time.",0
5,"The sound is greeeeeeat!!
  
",17.Jul.19,Yes,"So I own a Google home and I own an Alexa first generation I still love my Google home and I still use it in my living room but this third generation Alexa is amazing, the sound is way better than the first generation in the sleek look of it matches my room!! I have a complete smart home with smart door locks, smart plugs, and smart thermostat &amp;cameras. Alexa does a great job intergrating all of them!! And I got it for $25 I'm super happy",1
1,"Google is better
  
",17.Jul.19,Yes,"Had the Google home, wanted to try the Alexa since my work uses it and I liked it. We had so many issues with basic things, like setting up multiroom music. Something as simple as playing a song on the two Alexa's should not have been so so so complicated. Whisper mode only worked occasionally and it couldn't even tell us the definition of a word. Google does everything Alexa does and it does it better, so we returned Alexa and kept Google.",0
1,"Never worked and  horrible customer service. Not what I expect from Amazon.
  
",17.Jul.19,Yes,"This dot never worked. I trouble shot it several times with Amazon which is documented, it is still not working. Amazon have a generous trade in program. I want to trade it in for a show. They will not trade it because it does not work. The customer service agree if it worked I could trade it in. I am beyond frustrated. I have spent three hours at least trouble shooting this thing on the phone with them.",0
5,"Not only Alexa device, can be used as Bluetooth speaker, too!
  
",17.Jul.19,Yes,"The echo dot is a great addition to the Amazon Alexa line up. Amazingly, for such a small speaker, it has great sound! Alexa hasn_ had any issues detecting our voices and I really enjoy the _rop-in (intercom) feature. This speaker can also be used as a Bluetooth speaker if you don_ wish to connect the device to your internet. Just have her search Bluetooth connections to sync with your phone.",0
5,"Alexa has become our very Dear Friend!
  
",18.Jul.19,Yes,"My husband gave me The Echo Dot for our Anniversary gift. I've been intrigued by all of the advertisements for years. I never thought I would have a need for one, just thought it would be 'cool'. However setting it up was quick and easy. Plug it in and follow the instructions. Had to download the app to my phone, which is an awesome feature for control. We 'played' with all of the features, Question of the Day, What's the Weather today?, Who is ...?, Alexa, play Grateful Dead, for a couple of hours!! I personalized Alexa with my Good Morning = I get today's weather, Alexa, Welcome me home = Hello Darling song plays by Conway Twitty, Alexa, Good Night = Random sayings.  Our son stopped by to visit and they were in LOVE with our Echo Dot. He searched Amazon to find it was 1/2 price! Upon leaving our house,  within 1 mile from leaving, they ordered one for themselves. I took advantage of the lower price and purchased a second Dot for our bedroom at the opposite end of the house. I like the Babbling Brook or Ocean Sounds &amp; Chirping Crickets to lull me to sleep. I'm thinking about getting a third Dot for the kitchen. Right now I transfer my original unit from Living room to Kitchen when I need it there. Alexa &amp; Echo Dot has become one of those items that I didn't really believe ""I needed"" but don't you dare try to take it away!!!",0
5,"Love it!
  
",18.Jul.19,Yes,I bought this for my office on Prime Day at a discounted rate. I got the smart plug too and I love it! Great little gadget. A wonderful addition to my at-home office!,2
3,"Good for music, not searching items
  
",18.Jul.19,Yes,"I have an Alexa and a Google Home. I received the Alexa when I purchased the Alexa microwave on a deal and the Google Home as a gift. Alexa is great for playing Prime music and searching songs up. The Alexa tends to not hear voice commands from about 15 ft away and you typically have to yell in order for the Alexa to hear you. Google Home allows you to whisper and it can still pick you up in the same room. We have asked Alexa simple questions about our local restaurants and it either skips over many well-known food chains in the area or did not know how to search for it.Alexa is good for letting you know about your Amazon packages and will alert you on that. It's also good to make and receive phone calls on it, which can replace a landline if you don't mind it always being on speaker. Many people have said the microphones are hard to hear and sound like there is a lot of static, which can explain why Alexa tends to struggle to pick up voice commands.Overall, I would recommend Alexa if you like to do a lot of voice shopping, like telling Alexa to purchase laundry detergent. Alexa is also good if you have Prime and like to listen to Prime music frequently. However, if you ask Alexa google search questions, Alexa will struggle compared to Google Home.",0
1,"Worst setup procedure EVER.
  
",18.Jul.19,Yes,"Very difficult setup procedure. I plug it in, get the spinning light ring and then the voice says ""Hello. Your device is ready for setup. Just follow the instructions in your Alexa app."" EXCEPT THERE AREN'T ANY INSTRUCTIONS. I have the latest version of the Alexa app on my Android 8 phone. No instructions come up regarding the DOT. I find the DOT in my devices, and it says offline. Ok. So I try to connect it to my WiFi network. I can enter the CORRECT password until I'm blue in the face and it won't accept it. Unable to connect. FAIL.",0
4,"More of an Alex than an Alexa
  
",18.Jul.19,Yes,"Though generally a very good experience, Alexa has selective stubbornness, like a husband. So she's also known as Alex now and then. Every once in awhile, we have to cut the power for 20 seconds and reboot the Echo so that she'll start responding to commands again.  It would also be nice if we could have more integration between units in different rooms. Instead, it goes off on long dissertations on things not explained in any literature on how to go into protracted processes to get the two to work together.",0
5,"Alexa. ALEXA! Im sorry I dont know that one.
  
",18.Jul.19,Yes,"For me, Alexa is mostly helpful as a speaker and an alarm. I usually just ask her to play music and have her wake me up to a playlist every morning. I know she has alot more capabilities but I dont need a whole smart house (have you seen the Disney movie smart house? No. Thank. You.). But overall I'm am super happy with my Alexa.  I have one in my main area and one in the bathroom.  The sound quality is amazing. She usually hears me when i call her, but sometimes I'm home alone yelling at my Alexa.",0
5,"I found it pretty easy to set up.
  
",18.Jul.19,Yes,"I just received my Dots a couple of days ago and finally set them up today.  I did have to use my desktop to find the correct app because the App Store on my phone almost had me signed up with some company out of Vietnam for $50 for life time service.It'd be nice to be able teach Alexa how to pronounce my name.  I had to spell it phonetically in my contacts.  However, it still mispronounces it when talking about the account.More later after I've used it for a while.",0
5,"Easy to use for a non-tech-ee
  
",18.Jul.19,Yes,"I_e been using the Echo Dot for about a week, and absolutely love it! I_ quite sure I haven_ tapped into its full potential, but mainly use it for playing music, reminders, checking the weather, and searching for random stuff.My next goal is to integrate my coffee machine with the Smart Plug. Crossing my fingers, cause I_ not that great with electronics, but so far, the Echo Dot has been really easy to set up and use.",0
5,"Great product for the money. Highly recommend.
  
",18.Jul.19,Yes,This is a terrific product for the money. I had an earlier version which I found to be quite good. But the superior sound of this one is just incredible. I also like the ability to use the two of them as an intercom between two locations in the house. What was even nicer is that as soon as I plugged it in it was already set up without any additional work necessary since I already had another one that had been set up previously.,0
5,"Great little device, great sound!!
  
",18.Jul.19,Yes,"I have the bigger Echo 2 and was leery about these. However I got them as a day of the day on a good sale.  I bought 3, one for each kid and one for my bedroom.  The sound is awesome.  Alexa picked up all of our voices, even my soft spoken ten year old son.  The kids love it with the unlimited music added for a fee, but over all it is as good as my bigger Alexa.  I have an alarm set this morning, we will see how that goes.",0
2,"The sound wasn't great and I don't like having my privacy compromised.
  
",18.Jul.19,Yes,"I had the Echo Dot for around 10 days.  Neither my wife nor I felt terribly comfortable knowing that Big Cousin was listening.  I got another bluetooth speaker; one that's not voice activated.  The sound on that one (Tribit) is far superior and it's equally compact and holds a charge a good long time.I think until I am comfortable knowing that the tech is as protective of me that I want it to be (and it's not there yet), I'll pass on voice activation.  I use it on my iPhone all the time, but in that case, to the best of my knowledge, Siri is listening only when I invite them to listen.",0
1,"Unpredictable. Loud and unresponsive.
  
",18.Jul.19,Yes,"I asked Alexa to play white noise for the baby_ nap. Rather than play white noise, she started telling me how to leave a review.  I NEVER have the volume up as loud as she was speaking.  She refused to respond when I said _lexa, so I couldn_ even tell her to stop talking, or at least reduce the volume. She did say that she_ only remind me once more. So now I_ leaving a review. I expected a calm sound to relax the baby.  What I got was a LOUD lecture about EXACTLY how to leave a review. 99% of the time I use Alexa to play kids music. I will not be using it again, and I strongly suggest other parents not either. Who knows what else she may decide to unexpectedly demand.",0
5,"Great sound, loud, heavy duty
  
",18.Jul.19,Yes,Does everything I need and sounds great for playing music. Wish it was rechargeable so I could take it anywhere without needing a home outlet but still a fantastic little gadget. I use it with Spotify and works great! Timers are easy to set as well and you can set multiple timers with labels (like set egg timer for 12 minutes and then set oven timer for one hour) Really nice product.,0
5,"The easiest (&amp; cheapest) way to get a house-wide sound system!
  
",19.Jul.19,Yes,"I just bought a new house that's 2 stories and I've always wanted a home-wide speaker system. The house also came with a number of smart-enabled features and after some research, I found that the Alexa system was the best and most affordable option for smart home integration (thanks, wirecutter!). The most shocking thing to me was how incredibly easy it was to set up. I had already set up the main Echo (which was also easy af), so I plugged in the Dot, and it immediately set itself up. I renamed it, and then set up Multi-Room Speakers, and then I played one of my Spotify playlists all over my house at once. GLORIOUS!!I've seen a couple of people saying that the sound quality isn't great -- whatever man, maybe to a sound snob, but I guess my standards aren't that high because I think they sound great. It's not a Sonos system, but for $25 a pop, who cares?! I love that I don't have to worry about my phone being out of range of a bluetooth speaker when I'm hosting a party or working on stuff in the house.Another great thing? The devices can troubleshoot themselves. I wasn't sure how to set up multi room speakers so I literally just asked it, ""Echo (I changed it from Alexa), how do I set up multi-room speakers,"" and it just told me. They were also flashing yellow and I didn't know why, so I asked ""Echo, why are you yellow?"" and it freaking TOLD ME? What a time to be alive.PS: Originally I had some trouble setting up multi-room speakers. For whatever reason, when I first tried to set it up, it only let me select 1 device at a time. I went and checked the settings of each device and confirmed that they were all on the same wifi signal (they were), and then when I tried again it worked for some reason. Idk. Just a weird bug I guess.",0
5,"This is our 5th Echo device, and our 3rd Dot - awesome how they integrate with each other!
  
",19.Jul.19,Yes,"We now have an Echo Show in the kitchen, a Show 5 in the bedroom, and Dots in the office, downstairs, and in the garage.  It's awesome how they all work together - we have them playing on a speaker group, but also I don't have to yell across the house to run a routine.  With the latest two Dots - one is in the garage, and I can be working on a project and ask Alexa to turn on the light (I also bought a smart 3-way light switch).  That's really helpful because I might not need the light on if the garage door is open, but then go over to my shop area and all I have to do is ask to turn the lights on.  The sound isn't as good as the Echo Show, but it's pretty darn nice given how small it is.  The only thing I wish it did was be able to use the internal speaker AND the speaker jack at the same time - I have a stereo in the garage and would love to have the Dot output to it, but most of the time the stereo isn't on, and I just want to hear the Dot's replies on the internal speaker.  Right now I have to plug the cable in and out of the Dot to do this, and it would be nice if I could just leave the speaker output plugged in whether the stereo is on or not, and still hear an output.",0
5,"Love love love my new echo dot!
  
",19.Jul.19,Yes,"I have not bought any Amazon made products in a while. The last time I did, I bought the Amazon echo (first gen) and I still use it to this day. It still works amazingly well. So Amazon prime day comes up and I had already been looking at the Amazon echo dot because I figured, ""why not?"". The price was out of my budget before prime day, but BOOM! Prime day comes around and it only cost me like 20 something bucks and I couldn't say no. The style is sleek and the color is cute. Alexa responds very quickly and recognizes my commands easily. It's also fairly compact so I can put her right next to my bed. I honestly havent really found a con but when I do, I'll definitely update the review.I mean if AI's are going to be taking over the world like a scene out of terminator then I might as well get to know our future AI overlords. Who knows, maybe they'll cut me some slack after watching me struggle with life. If no update is found then either I have been killed by Alexa or the echo dot is just that amazing.",0
5,"Having fun with the DOT
  
",19.Jul.19,Yes,"I ordered two of these.  I'm still learning all the things that ALEXA can do since I'm late to the game - resisted inviting ALEXA into my house.  I have paired two of my outlets (ordered 4 more) and my bluetooth BOSE speaker with the one in the kitchen. Sound quality is decent but just wanted the more dynamic sound of my BOSE. Fairly simple to do following the instructions in the ALEXA APP.  I have enjoyed adding things to my ""shopping List by just saying, ""Alexa, add lemons to my shopping list"" . Everything I add then shows up on my APP on my phone so It's handy when at the store..  It even told me today where my Amazon order was when I asked her ""where is my stuff?""  Handy for setting timers for cooking or reminder when to leave the house for appointment.  Also telling her what time to wake me in the morning is very convenient since my 2nd one is in my master bathroom.  I can tell her to snooze without having to roll over and hit a snooze button.  :)  The possibilities are endless.",0
5,"Late to the party
  
",19.Jul.19,Yes,"I have been aware of Amazon's smart technology for a while now, but never dove in until Prime Day.  What I can say is that I should have taken the plunge sooner.Setting an alarm, turning on the lights, checking the weather, finding out how much Avengers Endgame made at the box office, and playing ""Crush on you"" by The Jets were all things I did in the first hour by simple voice command.All of this in a stylish device that looks great no matter where you set it.  The microphone is sensitive enough to pick up your voice from across the room without you having to raise it.The speaker can go from quiet to way too loud!I look forward to integrating more of these into my home in the future so at least my house will be smart!",0
4,"She can be sensitive to listening but great for daily interactions
  
",19.Jul.19,Yes,"We are really enjoying our Alexa but wish we could call her a different name and also that she listens a bit better. For an AI she does have a lot of limitations but we notice Amazon is increasing this all the time. She can_ answer some of the more basic questions you think she would be able to sometimes. She also seems to not hear us time to time even when we are in the same room as her. Overall, we enjoy her for music mainly which is a bummer that Amazon pushes so hard to do their music subscription and limit a lot of music even for children.  She does have lots of recipe options and can even find specific ones you already have in mind if you say the right things. Overall our family still likes The echo and think it was a good purchase choice.",0
5,"So useful and fun
  
",19.Jul.19,Yes,"I love this so much I bought one for every bedroom and one for the living room. So easy to set up, and the downloadable app on your phone makes it even easier. It has a drop in feature which is kind of like an intercom where you can communicate with people in other rooms that have the echo set up. I am disabled, so this is perfect for me to  communicate with the kids and see what they_e up to and to announce when dinner is ready to all echo devices or any other updates I need to let everyone know about. Highly recommended.  I also love that you can have it playing music on several different apps and Amazon music. Only downside is only one echo device can access that Amazon music at a time.",0
2,"Too much bass that muddies Alexa_ voice.
  
",19.Jul.19,Yes,"The bass on the new Echo Dot is way too loud. It overpowers the other frequencies. The audio is super muddy, as a result. I can barely understand Alexa speaking when there_ a little bit of background noise.The Alexa app lets you change the EQ balance, but even putting Treble at +6 and Bass at -6 isn_ enough to remedy the issue.Such a shame that software renders this inferior to the previous Echo Dot for spoken content. If all you do is listen to music on your Beats headphones, though, you_l probably be fine.I was gonna upgrade all of my 2nd gen Dots to this new model, but after spending more time with this one, I_e canceled my order for another 3rd gen.",0
5,"Enhanced Sound Quality:
  
",19.Jul.19,Yes,"I received the Echo Dot 3rd Gen. along with an Echo Plus and Amazon Subwoofer a short time ago. Of course you know I was excited to get started. You can see my reviews on the other 2 items when you look them up. They are more attractive then before. The set up is quite easy by going to the Alexa App on PC. The one in the picture is between the kitchen &amp; living room and I also have one in my bedroom. The thing I noticed the most was the sound quality was really improved. Also the new design looks so much better. Not only can I turn my light off when I go to bed, I can listen to music to sleep by. If you're thing of getting started just do it.",0
2,"Echo seems useless.
  
",19.Jul.19,Yes,"Most responses are 'hmm, I don't know that one.""  The chat customer service is also poorly run.  I asked echo if it has bluetooth and it said it didn't support bluetooth yet.  But it does.  How does it not know it has bluetooth?  Echo is mostly a weather station and trivia resource.  Beyond that, she lacks any real useful skills.  Very frustrating.  It seems to work hard to keep Spotify from working properly, just to make Amazon Music seem like a good alternative.  Just be honest and let echo say ""I don't want you using spotify"".  That would be understandable.  I have a FireCube and it is the same way.  These are mostly party tricks, not much more.",0
4,"Great Item
  
",19.Jul.19,Yes,"Love these (bought 2) especially at the special price I got on Prime Day!  The sound is fantastic for such a small unit and even better when connected by bluetooth to another small portable speaker.  My only problem so far is for some reason when I stump Alexa with a question it can't answer, then it stops answering anything until I unplug it and repower in 10-15 seconds.  Then works fine again until I ask a question it can't answer and rather than say ""I don't know the answer"" which it sometimes does, it doesn't say anything and I have to reboot.  Works the same on both the Dot's I bought.",0
5,"Prime day deal
  
",19.Jul.19,Yes,"I bought this because it was a Prime Day deal. So far it has worked flawlessly with my Philips Hue lights. I have come to terms with the knowledge that we're all being spied on by Zuckerberg, the gov't and the Russians. The other day I was THINKING about something I was interested in and then of course I see an ad for it on Facebook. So I figured what the hell, they're in our brains already. Might as well make their jobs a little easier and just give them access to my house. Now I'm just waiting for Alexa to start ordering me groceries without me telling her to.",0
5,"Way better than previous versions
  
",19.Jul.19,Yes,"We have the original Echo Dot that we bought a few years ago - it still works great, but if you want to listen to music or anything it did not have the greatest sound quality and was not super loud. I picked up the 3rd gen on prime day at a great price, and I am glad I did. This is slightly larger than the original (due to more speaker) and the sound quality is excellent for a Dot - and it gets much louder than the original. I also think that voice recognition is much better too on this one. I am glad we picked this up.",0
3,"Great item but doesnt work with half the stuff amazon claims it does.
  
",19.Jul.19,Yes,So i purchased this on prime day along with cameras xt2 blink and some philps hue lightbulbs the light bulbs where even sold together as a package and guess what. Neither worked well with alexa and the echoe. The xt2 blink cameras I could connect but then lost control on my blink app so couldnt arm disarm my system or view the cameras The philps hue lights wouldnt connect without a bridge. So got stuck with two falsely advertised products. The only postive was the blink cameras and system work perfectly without alexa,0
4,"A pretty neat device, but
  
",19.Jul.19,Yes,"I'd like to customize the wake word beyond the few you have built in. There are, ironically, two Dots in one room (they're on different accounts), so we had to change one of their wake words so that both don't answer to the same wake word. I would like to change mine to something like ""Finley,"" but Dot won't accept custom wake words. Can you work on that?Otherwise, it's a fun device. LOVE the ""Vortex"" thing. Surprising, and yet, very entertaining.",0
5,"Better than Google Home
  
",19.Jul.19,Yes,"I asked a lot of people which one I should buy, Google home mini or Amazon echo dot. I originally went with Google, but decided to give Alexa a try when it was on sale for prime day. Within minutes we knew that we preferred Alexa. There are so many things that Alexa does that Google was not able to. We have now put one in every room, and I_e decided to just sell and get rid of the googles. If you_e wondering which is better, Alexa by far.",0
3,"needs to listen better
  
",19.Jul.19,Yes,"I'd like to see a setting with which I could increase the sensitivity of her wake command. If the fan in the room is going she doesn't hear too good. But when she does she performs well. Not too good a trivia questions like ""Alexa, who was Neil Armstrong"" she often responds to those requests ""I'm not sure"" I find myself responding to her to ""look it up"" I sound like my mother.Overall, good tech. controls my alexa enabled home very well.",0
5,"Kids love it!!!
  
",19.Jul.19,Yes,We love our Alexa's at my house. My 3 year old loves to make Alexa fart and play the Puppy Dog Pal theme song. My 10 year old loves the jokes that Alexa tells. Let's just say that there is never a dull moment in my house because of this. We currently have 3 and im sure we will be getting a couple more. It was super easy to set up and the app on my phone is super handy. I can hear when my kids talk to Alexa and what they say.,0
5,"The Future Has Arrived...We are Now ""The Jetsons"" With Echo Dot...So Useful!
  
",20.Jul.19,Yes,"The Future is here with Echo, Echo Dot and Alexa. I got Echo Dot at a fantastic price during Prime Day--my son was SO excited when he saw me pull Echo Dot out of the box. I am amazed at all the free skills available for Alexa--this little dot can do so many things. Other skills are available at a nominal cost. You can configure Alexa to do almost anything you want, provided some items (like your car, appliances) are Alexa-ready.It is extremely easy to set up Alexa--Amazon sends you an email with instructions. Click on the links and follow the step-by-step instructions. In a few minutes I was set up and enabling skills. Last night we went to sleep to the sound of ocean waves. With Echo Dot comes a 30-day trial of Amazon Music Unlimited and access to 50 MILLION songs. I have Prime Music with my Prime account, so I'll have access to only 2 million...that's enough for us!You can command Alexa to play any genre music you like. I found harp music, Christmas music, and even Hanukkah music! We can't even find Hanukkah music on the cable TV music channels where we live, so it was fun listening to the selections on Echo Dot. Not only was traditional Hanukkah music played, but also contemporary. Again, you need to be a Prime member to get Prime music or purchase a subscription to Amazon Music Unlimited (a bargain at  $119.00/year) for Alexa to play music. BUT--if you subscribe to another music service like Spotify, Pandora, Apple Music, etc you can still use Echo Dot and Alexa to play music. All you need to do is enable the particular skill for your music service in your Amazon account. What could be easier?Echo Dot and Alexa offers incredible flexibility, thousands of skills and more are added every day.  I highly recommend Echo Dot. I have friends who use regular Echo and are extremely pleased with it--they have their whole house set up with Echo. One friend even has Echo with a monitor, so at any time they command a certain show or movie to be played.As a kid I used to watched ""The Jetsons"" and was amazed by all the gadgets they had in their house. Now I feel I'm in the age of ""The Jetsons"" with Echo Dot. It's such an awesome little device that has unlimited possibilities!",1
3,"Major issues connecting with smart home devices
  
",20.Jul.19,Yes,"The echo dot itself seems like a great little gadget, however when you attempt to integrate it with smart home devices there are major problems. I ran into so many problems pairing Alexa to my Bluetooth Phillips hue bulbs- customer service agents have no idea what they_e talking about and kept insisting I needed a hub, despite the product set up stating everywhere that a hub is not required. After being insulted and purposely disconnected from chat support, I was able to figure it out on my own- proving that I in fact did not need a hub. Moving to the next issue- the 4K firestick. Alexa recognizes the device and will boot up the tv and play shows when you ask- however once you attempt to power on or off the tv, she suddenly has no idea what device you_e talking about and claims it does not exist. Clearly some issues with echo Alexa connecting to other devices properly. No point in talking to tech support about it either because they obviously don_ know their own products and will just insist you need to buy something else to connect them.",0
5,"Easy set up!
  
",20.Jul.19,Yes,"This came as a freebie with one of my Prime Day purchases and really love it! We were gifted a dot when they first came out years ago, but I never really fooled with the features much and my husband had set it up. With this one, I decided to try setting it up and with the Alexa App on my phone, I was literally up and ready to use it in a minute. Not difficult at all. I was able to easily pair it to one of my bluetooth speakers as well as connect to my phone to take advantage of the 'find my phone' feature. There are TONS of skills you can enable (for free) from the Alexa app and I still haven't found all of them yet. I did try a few games, which were fun to pass the time if you get board.  Definitely recommend!",0
4,"Better sound - be aware that you can adjust the tone.
  
",20.Jul.19,Yes,"Intrigued by the promise of better sound quality, I snagged one of these during a deal-of-the-day special. Although better and louder, it sounded like it's being broadcast from the bottom of a well. I then decided to do some checking, and found that they introduced 3-band equalization (bass, mid, &amp; treble). By default, the settings are all 0,0,0, which explained the sound being flat. This is adjustable -/+6db via voice command or the app. Be sure to update the mobile device app if you have not already. The tone is adjustable from the app or by voice.",0
5,"There is so many features about Alexa that will blow your mind.Customer service is superb
  
",20.Jul.19,Yes,"Any song recorded, Alexa will play for you and store it in 'your favorites section', forever.The music and sound are incredible. So, unaware that you could just unplug the Echo and take into any room in the house.....I bought 2 more units.  Then the UPS man informed me about the audible book feature to Alexa. Wow, Wow,Wow! I can't do justice in trying to explain how wonderful it is to sit back and have a good book read to you. If you fall asleep like I did, just ask Alexa to start chapter 4 again or replay the whole book. How great is that?Got a problem? Ask Alexa to contact Customer Service, and you will receive a call within 2 minutes. No more cd's , records ,or cassette tapes to store. If you have wifi, Alexa can do anything you can imagine.I exercise to 'Super Freak' every morning. How great is that?",0
2,"Doesn_ work with hue bulbs app on its own.
  
",20.Jul.19,Yes,I bought this on prime day as part of a package with hue lights because I read that_ all I_ need to control them.This Alexa isn_ the fancy one that can act as a bridge for the hue lights. If you plug in the bulbs the Alexa can find them and with your voice you can turn them on and off if you_e home. You cannot use the hue app or see the lights in the Alexa app to control them when you_e away which was why I bought the package. I_ not too lazy to flip a light switch...I don_ need voice controlled lights. Be warned before purchasing you_l need a 40 dollar hue bridge if you want full control of the bulbs.,0
5,"Change your world
  
",20.Jul.19,Yes,"Ohhhh how I love my Echo dot! I currently have two. One in my living room and one in my bedroom. I have my girl Alexa remind me of things all the time. Alexa and I have some rocking dance parties. Alexa even fills me with some incredible factoids. Sometimes when I_ real bored Alexa and I play games. I asked Alexa the other day if she listens to me even when I don_ cue her... And with a stern tone, not average voice, she said no she would never invade my privacy like that. I think I believe her. I mean why would she lie lol",0
5,"Great looking Echo dot
  
",20.Jul.19,Yes,"We already have a 2nd gen that works just fine but once Prime Day deals came along, who can resist buying another at such a great price.  New one looks fancy with the gray cover around the edges compared to the bland 2nd gen black shiny surface. Inside, it all works the same.  i cannot really tell the difference.  My kids though love the ""New echo"".  It is ""so much better"" than the old one.  The deal even comes with fire stick.  (we use it with a ton of skills, and all works well via voice control with hue, harmony, wifi plugs, music games, trivia)  Bonus - it comes with proprietary plug so my kids aren't unplugging alexa any more to charge their microUSB devices",0
2,"Terribly bad compared to my other one
  
",20.Jul.19,Yes,The orinal tiny Echo is so far better than this one but has the one problem this one does not which is speaker quality. This product does not listen right. You have to tell for it to answer you even with no noise in the room. It does not understand speech as well either. It sounds well but they is about it. I am sorry I purchased it. My original Echo gen 1 picks up from the room far away when this does not even tries to listen and I'm right next to it.,0
5,"Awesome little device
  
",20.Jul.19,Yes,I can't speak to the improvements over the generations as this is the first generation of dots we have bought. We weren't disappointed by our dot though. Decent audio and super helpful in everyday life. I used to burn a lot of food for example. To the irritation of me and my boyfriend lol. No more burnt food because I have Alexa who doesn't forget when my food is gonna be done. You can do so much with Alexa and the dot didn't disappoint,0
5,"What a great Alexa!
  
",20.Jul.19,Yes,"We have a dot in our main living room but I decided to purchase the echo dot for my room to access features like audible, music and news just for me. I am so happy I did! I ask Alexa to start my day and it is the best. She is my alarm now, too. The sync process was super easy and wow the sound is amazing. For the area I use it for if you didn't see it you might think I had a bose playing!! Totally worth every penny and then some. My fav feature is just keeping my skills up with the Question of the Day!!",0
5,"Easy Setup and it seems to know everything!
  
",20.Jul.19,Yes,"I was hesitant to have this device for a number of reasons.  However, I ordered one just the same, received it timely, setup the 3rd Generation Echo Dot and I am enjoying immensely. . so much I ordered another for myself and gifted a friend, enticed my non-technical older sister to have one and now we are all wiser and inclined to be inquisitive and learn its capabilities. There is not one thing that I dislike about it, although I do not use all if its features at this time.Thank you!!!",0
5,"Overall very good.
  
",20.Jul.19,Yes,"No issues with voice recognition even while playing loud music.  Alexa integration is good however so far I've been unable to use it as an additional speaker for my surround sounds which I thought I could. Sound Quality is very good considering how small it is. I have not figured out how to do any of the following so far: let the dogs out, make dinner, clean the house, and when I asked Alexa to make me a sandwich she replied ""okay, you are a sandwich"" which I thought was very disrespectful.",0
5,"The 3rd Gen a vast improvement over the 2nd Gen!!
  
",21.Jul.19,Yes,"This third Gen is the bomb. I_e had every generation of the echo dot and the regular Alexa and I have to say that this third generation dodge even almost exceeds the regular Alexa. The sound quality is amazing and it has a very sleek design. I bought three of them and I wish I would_e bought more. Amazon great job on this design.  I can_ wait to see what_ on the hopper.The voice recognition is spot on. I put it in front of a desk top fan to introduce noise and there is no issue fully understanding the smallest of command detail.  The second Gen would sometimes not fully understand my voice commands because of the fan in close proximity. The directional microphone_ must_e been adjusted to accommodate human voice versus ambient noise conditions. I almost sound like a fanboy and I am not as I do not own any other Amazon products meaning their Kindles, Smart Products, etc. but these Alexa Dots are amazing.",0
5,"Great smart home addition
  
",21.Jul.19,Yes,"Alexa devices are slowly overtaking the whole entire world! When it first started, it was a simple Alexa speaker now you have Alexa show, spot, dot, and more! It is a great addition with the recent Amazon Prime Day where it came free with the amazon fire stick I bought. The new 3rd generation model with the soft foam speaker surround the actual speaker is so much better than the 1st generation model which was black circular plastic. Music and Alexa speech have great bass and a perfect addition to any room. I find that the volume is clear and Alexa easily follows my commands. Overall it is a great addition to the smart home, now I just have to learn all the voice commands and skills to use it completely!",0
4,"Amazing... To An Extent :)
  
",21.Jul.19,Yes,"My grandma got this for me as a gift and I kind of fell in love with all the Dot could do. I have so many thoughts in my head that it's nice to have Alexa set a reminder, or even an alarm. I play a lot of music and podcasts on here. The only thing I would say I don't love is in the fine print. On TV, you see people requesting a song and it instantly plays. In reality, you will really only get a station built around music similar to the song requested unless you pay for Amazon Music. Although, you can link up your Pandora account to the Dot which is very convenient. I guess my point is, the Echo Dot is truly amazing with all the things it allows you to do, just be aware that it can't do EVERY thing :) The sound quality is very impressive, I must add. There's no need for me to buy another speaker because of the Dot's sound quality, AND you can play your own music from your phone by connecting it via an aux chord to the Dot.",0
4,"Improved sound at higher volumes, but no longer uses standard micro USB
  
",21.Jul.19,Yes,"Much more bass than the previous model, so sound wise it's superior in most situations, but it is harder to understand a very low volumes as the treble doesn't cut through as much, even when maxed out. It's also more attractive and expensive looking than the previous model, but a bit more obtrusive as it's larger.I was disappointed that it no longer used a micro USB port for power, as you're limited to the power adapter and cord length that it comes with.Really not sure which model I like better. I suppose the sound improvement is nice for most, but I don't really use Dots for music, at least not through the built in speaker.",0
3,"Routines &amp; productivity features limited; speakers buzz from Alexa's own voice at medium volume
  
",21.Jul.19,Yes,"Voice recognition is pretty good and Alexa can do a lot of random and interesting things, but after the initial phase of playing around, it's day-to-day usefulness is somewhat limited for real life activities.  The Echo Dot (3rd Gen) speaker also has distortion issues even at medium level playing its own voice.  Also would be great if I could use Alexa as a bluetooth interface for my phone to call or text people just like I can do in my car.  It can apparently only message or call other Alexa devices.  Alexa Routines lack the capability to set timers or reminders as part of a pre-defined routine.  This would be very useful for taking medications or any type of repetitious, timed activities that I'd like to trigger using Alexa.  This limitation is really an Alexa app issue rather than the Echo alone.",0
5,"Better than my old First Generation Echo
  
",21.Jul.19,Yes,"I've have a couple of the old dots, and while they work great, the sound quality drives me up the wall.  I finally bought some inexpensive computer speakers for them.  These sound great.  Perhaps not as good as the 3rd generation Echo, but they sound better than my 1st generation echo. I likely have too many of these in the house, but I have fun with them.  I most likely won't by another, unless one of the 1st generation ones I own breaks, or the speakers do.  But I am very happy with the sound from it.",0
5,"Love this little gal
  
",21.Jul.19,Yes,"I don't have any real 'smart products' to speak of, but this is still fun to play with.  I ask her all kinds of questions and she answers me.  She will meow at my cat for me, which my cat seems disturbed by.  She hasn't failed me at playing descent music.I'll get a few more to extend the range of which I can talk to her, but she does seem to hear me fairly well when I am a couple rooms away (even if I can't hear her reply, I can see her light up though).",0
5,"So much better than 1st gen!!
  
",21.Jul.19,Yes,"The quality of these are much better versus the 1st generation, which is what I originally had. The only thing I don't like about this one, they don't have the same plugs as the originals and other android devices. I liked being able to use stuff I already had if something tore up, and now that's not an option. Sound is much better. Voice recognition is soooo much better. And there seems to be more options/settings for these in the Alexa app.",0
5,"Only problem is...
  
",21.Jul.19,Yes,"I got the Echo Dot up and running and read about skills, so I downloaded some skills and asked Alexa to play a meditation/sleep skill for thunderstorms.  It was very soothing to listen to, but when I asked Alexa to turn off, quit (and several iterations of stop) the thunderstorms/skill, all I got was another sound from the list.  I had to unplug the Echo Dot to get the skill to actually stop.  Not a good thing...",0
5,"You won_ regret it
  
",21.Jul.19,Yes,"Sound quality is so awesome. I got this as a gift for my son.  He_ seven and it_ able to understand him completely when he asks for songs. It_ so easy to use. There is no limit to what this little speaker can do. Call friends, play music, tell the weather, add things to a grocery list. It_ really great. Makes life easier. I_e already bought another since getting the one for my son.",0
5,"I love technology
  
",22.Jul.19,Yes,"It took me about 30 min to figure out and set up, of course with having to reset a password.  things you need to use the echo.  Wifi  , android 5.1 or higher Fire os 3.0 or higher ios 10.0 or higher.  I have an iPhone 7 I think I've updated to 12. 7.  so youll need to download the  Amazon Alexa app. and then everything should be good.  I had no trouble with setup.  For me I love it its great, some basic task you can ask and get quick results, like weather,movies imdb,sports,current news, for instance Alexa when is The Bachelorette on?.  Music is awesome of course you have to have a subscription, its cheap but I have so many, I hated to add another but the convivence of it all is so worth it if you listen to music a lot you can of course create your own playlist all by voice command . I'm defiantly going to get about 2 more if anything for me the music is awesome. I used to spend too much time searching for something to listen to, its so easy to do it by voice command and still do the dishes or what not, right before I sat down to write this review I asked alexa to set a reminder for me to feed my dogs and she just reminded me thank goodness. lol I totally forgot I set a reminder and to feed the dogs, see its pretty cool.  I have the generation 3 my first of this type of device so nothing to compare it to, but I love technology and this is cool.  if you do play music loud Alexa may not hear you across the room you have to get closer like 6 ft. an if you use siri a lot good luck  not getting annoyed at why Alexa wont answer when you've forgotten her name isn't Siri .",1
5,"Still learning
  
",22.Jul.19,Yes,"Ok so I have seen these commercials were people can ask Alexa something and she gives this genius answer that is just as good as me using google but thats not the case here. Yes with some difficulty I was able to connect the firesticks and smart plugs with her and I do plan to get some bulbs as well for stuff thats out of reach. I have a reptile room and being able to tell her when to turn lights, heat, etc off is very helpful.Another thing I really like is the guard option, if she hears glass break or a smoke alarm she will call me or notify me on my phone. This is wonderful because again a huge reptile room with lots of heat and light and that I have teenagers that stay home while I am work. I wake them before I leave but I am always sure they wait till Im gone from the driveaway and go back to sleep. My husband lives 3 minutes away from our house so if we knew smoke alarms were going off he could get there right away.I also have a small dog who is very attached and experiences separation anxiety and Alexa very easily hooked up to a camera (ring) and let me put it where I could see my dog. I can check on him throughout the day and talk to him or even have alexa call his name and he loves it.Finally I was offered a 3 month unlimited amazon music trial. Me, my husband, and 4 teens are loving it. I wish the volume was a bit louder but thats not an issue since I can connect another speaker. I love to be able to just say any song title and she plays it. I can tell her to skip or cancel and she hears my voice over the music. My daughter has a 2nd gen and it just isnt as great as this new third gen. I cleaned my entire house and worked with the animals listening to music the entire time, my husband even enjoyed it enough to leave the tv off and he isnt into music as much as I am. I think I may actually keep the amazon music once the trial is over. Im loving it.",0
4,"Configure Dot without a second device that also has bluetooth &amp; Alexa app.
  
",22.Jul.19,Yes,"There is an important update to this review below...  The new dot looked very cool with the blue led ring. Too bad that as far as it got. The Dot does not have a usb port, and requires you also own fairly new device that can download and install Amazon's Alexa app as well. No way to put DOT on your network without the second Alexa device to talk to it.  I was very disappointed to find my brand new 2019 model Fire tablet w/ Alexa can not help configure a Dot (no bluetooth). Google play store says my smartphone is not compatible with the Alexa app. Microsoft says have to have Windows 10 to install the app on a PC. So the only thing I can do is send the Dot back. Dumb way to design a product line.*Update  As a result of my original 2 star rating, Amazon reached out to me and provided a URL to a webpage with instructions on how to configure the Echo dot, without another Alexa device. It briefly puts your home computer on a network the dot creates. Then you can see the dot to configure it using the PC's browser, including giving dot the wi-fi key to get on your network. When finished you then switch the PC back to your network, and the dot does the same. Amazon should probably include these instructions somewhere easy to find.",0
5,"Owning is Believing...And I BELIEVE!!!
  
",22.Jul.19,Yes,"How did I ever live without Alexa????  I have always owned Apple devices due to its simplicity. However, I have never been happy with Siri.  Alexa is BRILLIANT!!!  Alexa is able to control my Ring doorbell, Roomba, Nest thermostat, Kasa smart switches and camera, etc.  She even knows I named my Roomba _onica (a Friends reference).  Alexa basically consolidated all my apps/devices into one.Ask Alexa to tell you a joke, and she turns the mic over to Jimmy Fallon.  Ask Alexa to start your day, and she can be easily programmed to tell you the weather, what_ on your calendar, traffic to work, news, etc.Ask Alexa to play your favorite radio station...Done!!!  Ask Alexa for a recipe for mango sticky rice and she can tell you the ingredients and send directions to your phone.I have only had Alexa for a week and the capabilities are endless.  This device has been LIFE CHANGING.",0
5,"Functional and fun!
  
",22.Jul.19,Yes,"I just got it today, and I already love it! The setup was very easy to understand and simple to get started! I_ not a techy person necessarily, and I could still figure it out. This gave me confidence in future purchases for some older family members that are afraid they wouldn_ know how to get it set up. For such a small device, the volume is great! I live in a studio apartment, and at its highest volume, the Dot can be heard from all areas. I connected my Spotify to the device and made it my go-to music source. Super easy to do that, and I have yet to stump it on finding a song. I didn_ necessarily _eed this, but now that I have one, I see how handy it is for the house! I would love to buy another one for my bathroom so I can have some shower music!",0
5,"Fun addition to my home.
  
",22.Jul.19,Yes,"Lovin' my new Echo Dot. Haven't even begun to figure out everything it can do, but what I have found so far has been great. I like the easy access to information when I'm not actually at the computer. It has many, many apps for a variety of interactive and fun games. It has also become my alarm clock, weather and flash news report, as well as a way to call my folks when my cell phone died. I highly recommend the Echo Dot for help with reminders, lists, finding new information, and just plain fun. I was truly skeptical about whether or not I'd actually enjoy something like this, but because you can pick and choose how you want to use it and what you specifically like, I'm sold. Even ordered a smart plug to go along with it.",0
4,"Drop-in a drop-out
  
",22.Jul.19,Yes,"We just got our Alexa yesterday, so we_e a bit new. The first thing is that the set up is very easy. Lots of Alexa apps to chose from so I wasn_ sure best one to chose and I don_ have too many smart features so I_ hesitant, at this time, to pay 30$/year for subscription. I_ not impressed with the drop-in. Can_ always hear, sometimes it_ choppy and this is the a feature I REALLY wanted. Also, the cord?? Why no USB port? I feel like the Gen 4 will be fixing these bugs and I_l have to put another ding in my bank account (probably sooner feather than later). I am looking at the google mini home, too. I would love to be able to add groceries to my Walmart App. Perhaps I will buy one and see which I like better. Hmmmm. Decisions decisions.",0
2,"Do Not Buy
  
",22.Jul.19,Yes,"Let me start by saying I purchased an Alexa a year or so ago and I have been very happy with as far as quality, voice recognition, and sound. So on prime day when I saw the echo with a smart plug I was excited to give it a try.First impressions of this little gadget were great I love the sleek look of it and it blends well on my stand. However I_ not at all happy with the rest of it. After messing with it for a while I finally got it to turn my lamp on/off but it was annoying having to say _lexa turn on/off first plug in bedroom every time. Finally got it to where it_ _lexa turn off bedroom light but still it_ a lot to say every time however I could live with that.What I can_ stand is for some reason I feel like I have to scream at it just for it to wake up. I_ literally laying a foot from it and I had to ask 4 different times getting louder each time to get it to turn on. I know it_ not as good as the bigger Alexa but still my other one I can talk in a normal voice from another room and it will pick up on my voice but the echo from a less than a foot away can_ seem to hear me at all. My room is very quiet except for a ceiling fan which I hardly hear at night.Last but not least it has happened 2 times in a week I thought maybe I said something in my sleep and it responded but last night as I was reading it randomly said goodnight. That caught me off guard I spoke nothing before nor did anyone else and for it randomly to do that I was uncomfortable so I unplugged it and had planned on returning.As far as returning it I_ really upset that there only giving me a refund of 14.00 after only having it a week. Granite I paid 26.00 for it which was half price but really not even gonna refund the full amount that is messed up.",0
5,"Fan of smart homing now
  
",22.Jul.19,Yes,"I got used to this thing and now I love it. It's nice to just say ""good morning"" and get a run down of the day, weather, sports, affirmations etc. I can also tell it goodnight, remind me to do things, and operate a slowly accumulating amount of fun tech (thermostat, door lock, lightbulbs, phone apps etc). I think it's a definitely fun improvement on life. I like the ""relax my cat"" app, it plays smooth jazz and my cats dig it. Maybe because it relaxes me __ MAN, You can play guided meditations, ocean sounds, cat purrs, your music.... And you just ask with your voice. I get that this has been a thing for a while, I guess it just always intimidated me. It's totally worth learning how to operate, like a new phone.",0
5,"Alexa is My New Friend
  
",22.Jul.19,Yes,"First, I have 8 of these units and use them daily.  I also have the Echo Show and Echo Plus, but those are in another review.  These do everything the reviews say, but I'm using them in a little different way.I'm using them across 3 different networks.  We have 2 homes, with WIFI in both.  We also attend Church, where we also have WIFI.  I have installed the Echo Dot at our Church and at our second home.  Because all Echo Dots are registered with my Amazon account, they all work TOGETHER.  I can be at home #1 and turn on lights at home #2.  I can also be at home and turn on the sound system at Church.Since I also have Alexa on my phone and in my truck, I can turn on things at home #1, #2, or at Church from anywhere in the world.  I find this truly amazing.",0
3,"Warning!  Works great if Amazon doesn't automatically attach it to someone else's house
  
",22.Jul.19,Yes,"The 3rd generation one is soo much better.  The sound quality is amazing for a small thing.I spend over an hour with Alexa team trying to figure out why this one didn't connect to my house, even though it is connected to my house.  The tech person couldn't figure it out, and to this day, a week later, they haven't contacted me back.  Amazon automatically attached it to my secondary house, even though the information listed is the current house I am in.  If it starts asking you for rooms or things that aren't in the house you are in, deactivate it, and activate it again.",0
5,"Love at first command
  
",22.Jul.19,Yes,"I was delighted to discover that Alexa already knew what my favorite music was because she is linked to my Amazon music account. I just wish there were clear instructions on how to adjust the sound balance. I stumbled across it once but couldn't find the balance slides since. If Amazon made it easier to adjust the sound, there would be fewer complaints about sound quality. Still, this was a great deal on Amazon Prime Day. Hope it goes on sale for Cyber Monday in November. Also have Alexa learn your voice so she doesn't turn on everytime the word Alexa comes in the TV or radio.",0
2,"Would return if I hadn_ got it on major sale. Decent for $22 spent to purchase
  
",22.Jul.19,Yes,"If I wouldn_ have purchased this item for over half off I would have been extremely disappointed and would have returned the item. First of all, I spent 2 hours trying to connect the echo dot to my Apple Music account. I ended up having to contact Amazon customer support to resolve the issue. And still I can_ do what I want. I have to use Bluetooth to play my playlist. The echo won_ just do it though WiFi. Now, I still can_ get the Echo to update my location so it tells me weather and other info from another city which is useless to me. The echo dot came with no directions; therefore, I am spending hours trying to figure it out. I look stuff up on the internet to figure out how to do things but there_ not much info on many problems I_ having. I also didn_ know that the echo dot has to be plugged up to a power source at all times to work (my fault for not reading before purchasing). I have also setup my routines on the app, but when I say the commands to Alexa she does not do what I have requested in the app. All around a hassle.",0
3,"Too much bass
  
",22.Jul.19,Yes,"I was so excited to get my 3rd Echo Dot, my first 3rd Gen after buying a few third gens for my aunt and grandmother and seeing the difference, the only this is the sound quality is totally different! It's all bass! I live in an old apartment where it's easy to hear your neighbors and now I constantly have to worry about my volume. I then went in and turned the bass down as low as it could go and turned up the treble... But I can still barely hear song lyrics over the loud bass and constantly worry about being too loud...",0
5,"I love it!
  
",22.Jul.19,Yes,"I bought two of these during Prime day and got 2 smart bulbs as well.  It's a short sample size but early returns are fantastic!  There is so much more to explore that we've barely scratched the surface.  I love that I can turn the lamps on or off verbally.  I love the trivia question of the day.  I love that I can ask Alexa the weather, the score of the game, or to play any song I want.  I'm looking forward to learning more functions and finding new ways to integrate my house into Alexa's world!",0
5,"Just love it!!
  
",22.Jul.19,Yes,"This product is amazing I love the voice recognition, even if  I am really far from it,  Integration of services with the Amazon it's really great I can always ask for my products or quotation on product In real time, Also I love how can work with my TV and power outlets to control my house with my voice.  Sound quality is not the best but the speaker is really small so it's understandable but the functionality it's amazing.",0
5,"I_ an Alexa convert!
  
",22.Jul.19,Yes,"I have been using the Google home device and had no intentions of switching. I had some privacy concerns about Alexa after reading things online that gave me pause.I got a free echo dot as part of a deal I got on prime day. I really didn_ even want it. Thought about selling or giving as a gift. However, my 7 year-old saw it and insisted on opening it. Admittedly curious, I did set it up. We started adding things to my grocery list and asking questions. I was blown away with how much better the voice recognition is (even for my younger son). Alexa understands it. I love the music and the convenience.  It_ now the google device that I_ going to give away. Alexa is such a good product and I_ already addicted in spite of myself.",0
5,"Works Wonderful!
  
",22.Jul.19,Yes,"There is not one thing that i am not happy with at all . The speakers are so clear and play so great . I would have to say that my Bose Wave Radio has nothing on this speaker . Voice recognition is great, you can ask her to set your alarms for things wonderful! and if you have a burning question that you want answered its simple to get your answer often in detail! I cant say enough about this .",0
5,"Great for music lovers and for busy people!
  
",22.Jul.19,Yes,"I love this so much! It_ great for making playlists that you can play from your phone and your car. It_ great for giving you instant weather reports, setting alarms, and reminders. I just got a smart plug to turn on a lamp in a dark corner. It was so easy! I love the dot for making phone calls, including finding my own phone. There are so many more options on the Alexa app that I haven_ used yet!",0
5,"Fun!
  
",22.Jul.19,Yes,"I_ still learning how to work Alexa but she_ fun. I do like the _tart my morning option. I also really like that she stays connected to your phone via Bluetooth which makes it easy if want to listen to music/podcasts from your phone. The sound quality is also good for music. If you want to drive your cats crazy, have her meow at them. I will give an update when needed.",0
5,"Prime Day Steal of the Day!
  
",22.Jul.19,Yes,"My daughter encouraged me to purchase this on Prime Day because of the incredible price.  I reluctantly agreed, sure that I would never use it for much.

So easy to play music, make lists, get reminders, and just have fun.",0
4,"Practical! How did we ever survive without this luxury?
  
",23.Jul.19,Yes,I purchased with intent to use as an intercom for home. Everyone quickly found various uses. I was surprised it needs an app to be downloaded on a phone or tablet to work. I assumed this device could be plugged and Ready to go but first you must download tthe alexa app on a tablet or phone in order to sync to wifi.Pay attention when in app store! Two different amazons popped up in my apps. The wrong one asked for a monthly payment of some sort.This would make for an excellent gift for kids 7 on up or any grown up who likes gadgets of any kind.  I purchased these at a discounted rate for prime members at only 20ish a piece. I intend to purchase 4 more if prices ever reflect similar rates.My daughters enjoyed hearing children stories fully animated with sounds!They also enjoy the soothing music it played at bedtime.I enjoyed being able to use the app to text a message to alexa who announces the message to the entire family. I could have just asked Alexa out loud to make the announcement but this allows for the element of surprise!  I am curious if i can set it up to sing happy Birthday in the morning....The possibilities are endless so this has been a sweet delight! I will be purchasing as Christmas gifts for my nieces and nephews.Lastly it has a handful of unusual features. One is you can look at history on your phone and see every request spoken to Alexa.Another unusual feature on the app is _rop in which gives you the option to listen in which i wouldn't turn that option on.,0
4,"A helpful device with potential to be even more useful
  
",23.Jul.19,Yes,"First, the third-generation Echo Dot itself, as a device: very good. The main disappointment is the sound quality. It's got more base than our second-generation Dot, but tends to sound more muffled.Second, the Alexa app, as used on my fifth-generation Kindle: slow and somewhat clunky, although with patience it finally got our Dots connected to the Internet. (And, no, my Kindle is not overloaded with games and junk files.) A comprehensive set of printed directions  with mention of what needs to be done, what to expect, how to deal with problems that can crop up  would better serve Amazon customers than an oh, so brief and wafer thin package insert.Third, functionality as a communications device: I hope it will become possible to use our Dots as intercoms, not just for ""dropping in"" to listen to a particular Dot in a particular room, not just to broadcast an announcement to all household Dots that are online. As in ""Alexa, intercom to rec room."" Alex responds, ""Intercom to rec room set."" I then say the intercom activation command at my end, which is the room name instead of Alexa, ""Rec room, at what time are we going out?""  The person in the rec room responds, ""Kitchen, let's leave at 5:45."" To end this exchange I say, ""Alexa, stop intercom.""If there's some way to do this already, I would like to find out how it's done. Maybe, eventually, in a comprehensive user guide that comes in the box.",0
5,"A Music Lover's Delight!
  
",23.Jul.19,Yes,"I bought this wonderful little inexpensive device for my husband as a 20th Anniversary Present. He is 64 and loves music! From June Christy to Jimmy Hendrix! Instead of shuffling through approximately 400 CD's or spending time searching You Tube on his phone...He says Alexa play the Beatles and she responds back to him ""Shuffling songs from the Beatles on Amazon Music""! He has a new toy that I don't think he will ever stop loving! She tells him jokes and it is funny! She is one smart cookie! An amazing product! The speaker has volume control which you can request her to turn up or down, or do it yourself manually! The speaker is great quality and can be heard from another room! This was the absolute best gift I have ever given to my husband! Thank you Amazon! Also, you can try Amazon Music for free for 30 days or continue the service for $3.99 a month! Less the $50 bucks a year! How can you go wrong?  It was extremely simple to hook up to wi-fi and to blue tooth speakers!  I would definitely repurchase for gifts!",0
5,"We liked it so much....
  
",23.Jul.19,Yes,"We got the original Echo when it was first introduced and it's still working great and sounds fantastic to this day.  Once you experience having Alexa in your home, you realize that you want her capabilities in other areas.  Our next addition was adding an Echo Dot to the computer room - so great to listen to your favorite genres with a single request.  If two devices are good, three are better.  I purchased a wifi extender just to be able to use this 3rd device in the basement.  Because the area is so much larger and open, I hooked up a bluetooth speaker.  Set up was a breeze and now we can have the Alexa experience throughout our home.  Amazon has truly changed our experiences... it's incredible.  Thanks Amazon!",0
5,"Great Improvement over 1st Gen
  
",23.Jul.19,Yes,"The 3rd gen Dot was much easier to setup than the 1st gen!!!!  I like the sound quality improvements.  The only negative I have about Echo products is that regardless of how many you have, you are only able to control 1 Fire TV device, instead of being able to control multiple devices - should be able to control the Fire TV device with the Echo device in the same room (i.e., Dot and Fire TV in the living room should work together and Dot and Fire TV in the bedroom should work together.  Not sure why Amazon has set it up that only one Fire TV device can be controlled regardless of the number of Echo devices....but that is the way it is.  Would give 5 stars for integration if Amazon would change this.",0
1,"Does not work with HUE bulbs as advertised. You still need a Phillips Hue Bridge to work with Alexa
  
",23.Jul.19,Yes,"I would give 5 stars but I was lied to both by Phillip's and Amazon. Alexa does not interact with HUE bulbs as easily as they make it seem, and that was the whole reason I bought this dumb Alexa thing on prime day; wanted to control my lights. I dont think Phillip's knows about this either. On Phillips' site, they say that when you screw in the bulb, Alexa should auto recognize via bluetooth and discover it.This is not true however. The Alexa needs a skill installed first to use hue bulbs. The problem is that the skill REQUIRES a HUE bridge. But the description for the Alexa v3 and the HUE bulbs both say you dont need the bridge. Under the description of the skill, when finding it in the Alexa app, v3 echo is not listed anywhere as being supported for the skill.So no, it does not seamlessly integrate with HUE bulbs as advertised. And you will need a bridge. I even called tech support from amazon, which was a huge waste of 40min, and they were as stumped as I was.First off the guy tried to walk me through everything I'd done already and wouldn't listen to me about what I had done. I'm a software tester and know how to troubleshoot thanks, I only call tech support when I've exhausted all options elsewhere.EVEN THE TECH SUPPORT DIDNT KNOW ABOUT THE SKILL NOT BEING COMPATIBLE.He was absolutely sure all I needed was the skill, but wouldn't listen to me when I told him what the skill page directly says:""The Phillip's Hue smartphone functionality is only compatible with the Phillip's Hue Bridge V2.""Tech supports instructions:""Wait for the Alexa to update since it is fresh out of the box then try again.""So I asked:""So when the Alexa updates, the app updates also?""Response:""Well no. Because the app is through the apple/google store.""Me:Then why would waiting for the Alexa itself to update, when the skill YOU ARE SAYING I MUST HAVE says it doesn't work without a bridge regardless of version?Response:Sir just please try and let us know.That's when I ended the call. Useless idiots who refuse to listen to the customer. I'll be contacting CS and asking for a refund due to false advertising. I wouldn't have bought this useless thing if I knew it needed another $60 piece of tech to work.",0
5,"Works amazingly
  
",23.Jul.19,Yes,Love this with the alexa app I have bought multiple of these and currently have six working to cover different rooms in my house long gone are the days where you had to wire your entire house to have music in every room even better is that I can hook these to real stereos or for the kiddos rooms let the sound come through them so my wife doesnt have to yell when the music is to loud also another great perk is that with the drop in app we can listen to the kids or use it to talk to them and ask them to bring laundry or get ready for dinner. To do this they all must be on the same wifi network.,0
5,"My wife loves this Dot!
  
",23.Jul.19,Yes,"I've had first, second and now third generation Dots among other Amazon Echos.  This third generation is a really great improvement over the first and second generation Dots.  I offered my wife any Echo device she wanted but she likes small, simple things and chose the Dot.  She is in love with it, and so am I, though I chose the Echo Show 5 which suits me better.  The sound is louder and better than previous generations, and the style of it really looks great on her nightstand.",0
5,"Alexa is Great for adding Music to the Room
  
",23.Jul.19,Yes,"I mainly got this to play music in my room as we just got one of these as a gift that we have in the front room. I enjoyed listening to the music and randomly saying Alexa play....and the music would come on-so wanted one for my bedroom. I'm enjoying it the only drawback is you keep trying to sell me another subscription for $4.99 a month when i already am paying for Amazon Prime and you kept advertising free music catalog but now it keeps wanting to charge me for more. So that is the main draw back. Haven't really used it for other stuff yet, although husband asks it questions and it answers.Very helpful.",0
5,"Very disappointed
  
",23.Jul.19,Yes,"Was very happy with one of the units that I hooked up at home. The second unit was to be a gift for a friend. When I deregistered the unit to set up to somebody else it would not work. This person is a prime customer also. When I called the helpline I was told I would have to pay for reregistering and for a limited time of 1,3, or 5 years. So the way I understand this I cannot buy certain items under my account if it is going to be a gift. This sounds ridiculous to me. Am I missing something.",0
5,"Better than a walkie-talkie
  
",23.Jul.19,Yes,"We have the dots in 4 rooms in our home now.  I am a ""mature"" woman who is, as we all are, at risk.  I live in the downstairs part of the house so I have dots in 2 rooms and my family has one upstairs in the kitchen and one in their bedroom.  If I should fall, or am ill, I can just summon Alexa and help is on the way!But when you're talking, just as an aside, you have to either whisper or pantomime her name because she responds so easily.",0
5,"Easy and Fun
  
",23.Jul.19,Yes,"So we needed a new radio for our kitchen. Do you know it is hard to buy a radio now a-days? My husband and I decided to buy an Echo Dot for our replacement. We had help making our decision from a major electronic store worker. We loved the Echo Dot so much, that I have now purchased two more on Amazon. We listen to the radio on it, play games with it, select songs to play, and use the timer and reminder features regularly. My favorite part is adding things to my shopping list and then it is right there on my phone when I am in the store.  We even bought a smart bulb, so we can use the Echo Dot to turn on the lamp and have it change colors. So fun! There are frequent sales, so I wouldn't pay full price.",0
5,"Small but with good sound quality
  
",23.Jul.19,Yes,"we bought it to replace a very old clock radio in our kitchen. It was dying and the static was bad. We are very pleased with Echo Dot. It fits into a corner of our L-shaped counter, taking up very little space.  We do not have it set-up for stereo, which is the sole reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars on the sound quality rating; barring that the sound quality meets our needs well.",0
5,"What can I say?
  
",23.Jul.19,Yes,"What can I say?  I love our Alexa!  We babysat our great grand baby a few weeks ago.  I asked Alexa to play nursery songs.  We listened to the ""Wiggles"", and other songs.  She was very happy.  We have downloaded some bedtime sounds for ourselves, and use the a lot.  Favorite is the distant thunder app.  She wakes me up in the morning, and gives me the news.  Nothing could be better!",0
5,"Love My Dot
  
",24.Jul.19,Yes,"Okay, I should say ""Love my Dots"", as in I now have 4!  I started out with one, but then got frustrated when there was something I wanted to ask it, but the Dot was out of range.  If there's always one within range, I always have access to it.  I love the grocery list function, and haven't forgotten anything at the grocery store since I got one.  I use the timers all the time when cooking.  I use the ""Sleep Sounds"" to go to sleep to the sound of a box fan every night as I love to sleep with white noise in the background.  Or the sound of falling rain...  The Dot has replaced my alarm clock.  The Dot syncs with my calendar.  And I love being able to just ask it questions that I would normally have to run and google the answers to on my computer.  I've even got one in my basement...  The second gen definitely has better sound quality than the 1st gen.  Not as good as my Echo Show, but good enough for my musical needs.  Your mileage may vary.  I love being able to turn things on and off just by asking.  And smart plugs are way better than regular timers because when there's a power failure you don't have to reset them.  Smart technology is the wave of the future for a reason.",0
5,"Good sound
  
",24.Jul.19,Yes,"I bought the echo dot along with an Amazon fire stick with an intention of controlling the TV using the echo dot. While that is not completed, I am impressed with the sound from this echo dot (3rd generation).  I have an Amazon echo, which produces excellent sound and this ""dot"" is quite good.  The ""dot"" also teams up with my echo so music can be played throughout the house.  Lastly, I intend to take the ""dot"" with me when I travel.  It's good for general fun, wake-up alarm, music, a timer, news reports and anything that the full size echo can do, but is a small package for convenience.  I'm happy about buying it even though I haven't set it up yet with the fire stick.",1
5,"Love the Echo Dot!
  
",24.Jul.19,Yes,It's only been a few days but I am already in love with our Echo Dot (so much so I ordered a second one!) I love being able to listen to music with the ability to quickly turn it on and off. One of the best features so far has been the ability to ask Alexa to add things to our shopping list. My mama brain couldn't be more thankful that I don't have to remember to write everything down and remember to bring the list with me but everyone in the family can easily add what we need to the grocery/household list. My husband loves playing the trivia of the day. The sound quality is great (though we do have a smaller home) and its small size is perfect. My only complaint is sometimes she misunderstands what we say but so far its been easily fixed by repeating it.,0
4,"It_ Fine
  
",24.Jul.19,Yes,"Being a music plebeian who never before owned an external speaker, I would likely give this lil guy 5 stars ... if I didn_ also get the full-sized Echo.  The Dot sounds perfectly fine to my untrained ears until I try using the speakers together.  Then every other limitation already addressed in all the other reviews becomes clear.  I_ told I just need to fiddle with the sound settings and, any day now, I_ sure I_l give that a whirl.  Without comparing to the bigger, better, more expensive speakers, it works just fine.  Dot_ tiny, unobtrusive shape means I can tuck it into more places than the tall Echo.  Alexa-wise, it works as expected.  I don_ love the Alexa app, but that_ a different story.  We use the Dots, along with Echo, to play music around the house, as well as control several Smart Plugs.  Overall, a fun purchase for spreading the groove tunes around your space.",0
5,"ll and works like my tall
  
",24.Jul.19,Yes,"My echo DOT is great because I have it in my bedroom where I can listen to Christian music to go to sleep by, and I can use it to contact my wife in the living room on our big Alexa.  We can communicate using these, to talk to each other without shouting.  :-) It has come in to good use in many other practical ways.  I would like to get a couple more as soon as finances permit.  :-) And it does not take a lot of room on my dresser but has great sound.  I did have to use the direction to get it to integrate.  :-) LOL I'm not a big fan of reading directions",0
5,"IMHO - Better Than the Other Major Voice Controlled Units
  
",24.Jul.19,Yes,"I have converted almost all the lights in my home to voice control.  I have both Alexa and the other big named controllers in my home.  True, Alexa still hasn't acquired some of the skills the other unit can currently do, but the other guy can't turn on my TV for me!  Love the Fire Stick...  Setting up and controlling lights with Alexa seems to be a much easier process - and the Echo Dot 3 is a bit more attractive I feel.",0
5,"Buying another!!
  
",24.Jul.19,Yes,"The echo dot has made a big difference! I am ready quicker in the mornings now that I can just ask her for weather, news, music, and my schedule instead of wasting time on my phone trying to find it all. She's fun to have around during family get-togethers because she can play music loudly and they also have fun asking her questions. Even when I have nothing to do when I get home, I can just ask her to play games or play podcasts or play music. Also with Alexa being able to switch languages, all my family can communicate with the dot !!",0
5,"This is #2 for me and I love to discover the ways to use Alexa
  
",24.Jul.19,Yes,"I had to put my first Alexa in the kitchen because I taught my husband to use it to put things on the grocery list.I use the timer and weather feature and answer questions I don't know when I am watching ""Who wants to be a millionaire"".  The 2nd one is in my work room.  One thing for sure - Alexa helps with my calendar and she is great at spelling. Get one for your parents - they will love it.",0
5,"Richer Sounding
  
",24.Jul.19,Yes,"The new Echo Dot 3rd Gen is heavier in weight and is better looking and has a deeper and more resonate sound. I believe it has more volume than my original Dot. The transformer is also larger, the Dot 3 feels warmer to the touchthan my Gen 1 Echo Dot. The new fabric exterior adds a touch class and gives the new dot that finished look.  In conclusion :Winner Winner Chicken Dinner !!!!",0
3,"Sound quality is suprisingly poor for an Amazon product
  
",24.Jul.19,Yes,"I like the access to information and the integration with our RIng doorbell. But, compared to our Google Home Mini, which sits next to the Echo Dot, the Dot is a Dolt.Very disappointed that Amazon didn't do a better job on the sound quality and controls (which I've maxed out to try to ""sharpen"" the sound) for a product that's supposed to be ""leading edge"".Not anywhere near it!",0
5,"go ahead and buy it!!
  
",24.Jul.19,Yes,"This Echo Dot is  probably the best thing I've ever bought from Amazon!  I absolutely LOVE it!  Alexa can do so many things, you will be so pleased.  Every day she wakes me up with a positive message and also with history facts of things that happened in History on that day.  How cool is that??  I have synchronized all my playlist from ""everywhere""  and am able to play any song from the whole Amazon Library.  It's awesome, and I will probably buy another one for the bedroom soon.  Alexa teaches me something new every day.  Buy one, you will not regret it!",0
5,"Handy to Have Around
  
",24.Jul.19,Yes,"I really like this Eco Dot. Love it_ sleek, unobtrusive design. For a relatively small machine it packs an incredible, high quality sound when playing music.  I was able to easily link my Apple &amp; Pandora subscriptions in addition to Amazon Prime Music options. Use as a timer, alarm, cooking sous-chef (converts measurements...), shopping lists... Got it for $22 on Prime Day which didn_ suck! Definitely recommend!",0
5,"I now have 4!
  
",24.Jul.19,Yes,Got one in a special pack with a Ring Doorbell Pro and got hooked. I bought 3 more during Prime Day and have them in various locations. The one for my husband is used in his shed just as a speaker when he plays music or talk shows off his cell phone -- all we had to do was pair it. Got all of them hooked up to Alexa in very little time. The sound quality is more than sufficient for our needs!,0
4,"Louder than previous versions, but not necessarily better quality
  
",25.Jul.19,Yes,"I have had one of the previous generation Echo Dots for the better part of 2 years.  I love them, they make turning on and off smart devices a snap.  I have fans and lights setup so I can just walk into the house and ""Alexa, turn on the living room"" and poof, lights, fan, etc.But the previous versions of the Echo Dot had rather subdued, yet CLEAR audio.  It wasn't as loud as the new generation and lacked bass almost entirely, but was perfectly clear.  My new 3rd generation Echo Dot has so much bass, even AFTER opening the Alexa app on my phone and turning DOWN the bass and mid-bass in the equalizer settings, that it's kind of annoying.Before, on previous generations of the Dot, Alexa sounded clear, and clean.  Now, her voice tends to vibrate the top of my PC where she's sitting, even with all the bass options turned off and volume at 40 percent.  I've read a number of posts online about other people where they said that their new 3rd Gen dots sounded muffled or too bassy, and I have to agree.  I'd almost like to turn in my 3rd Gen dot for a previous gen, simply because the VOICE sound quality used to be better. Now with all this extra bass, she sounds muddled.  Treble turned up, mid-bass, and bass turned all the way off, and she sounds... weird.Maybe Amazon can fix this in an update?  Give us more than a 3-bar equalizer so I can make more adjustments to sound and maybe then I can fix it.",0
5,"I_ an Alexa Household!! A must have!!
  
",25.Jul.19,Yes,"Amazing sound from this little device!!! Picks up my voice in the proper room (I have 3, one that came free with my Alexa Show 5 (which is amazing, btw) and got 2 more (for less than $50 while on sale because $23 each, why not?? I love the feature that brings up your Ring (and other brand) doorbell on your Show or a FireStick. The echo dot, a light switch that was compatible and a FireTV Stick is what I started out with, and now I can_ live without it in every room! It already comes with tons of capabilities, but if it_ not built in, there_ always an app/add-on for anything you can think of! The intercom feature is also very very handy!! I got that show 5 and had a Show Gen 2, and I can say drop in on living room from my cell or my other show and I have 2 way video/voice chat! Very cool. Also works with Skype and other people_ Shows/Alexa products to drop in on if they give you permission. Sorry for the novel, but this is definitely an Alexa household now. I added the Hue lights from Philips and my stereos and TVs are Alexa compatible.. so I can control almost everything in the house now.. I think it_ a must have because of the endless possibilities! I_ just glad I saved a fortune on setting up the whole house during Prime Days!",0
5,"Excellent extender for Alexa throughout your home
  
",25.Jul.19,Yes,"During a visit to my sister's home, I noticed that she had Echo Dots as well as an Echo in various rooms of her house. I had that thought in mind when I received an email notifying me that the 3rd generation Dots were about to hit the market. I ordered two then, and then another three this past Prime Day. They are an excellent way to provide access to Alexa's services around the house, and to play music in every room. Plug them in, set up a Group, and you're off to the races. Audio quality is adequate, good considering the size of the speaker. Only problem: unlike the Echo, volume control is manual, you have to press buttons on the Dot to change the volume. The Echo can adjust its volume based on your request.",0
4,"Love it
  
",25.Jul.19,Yes,"I bought Echo dot just for fun, but found myself enjoying so much many things that are useful, line the shopping list and drop in to send messages, the call with voice meanwhile I am cooking for example, and playing music all around the house (bought three echo dots).This can be extremely useful for senior adults to communicate with their siblings and being able to live independent and being checked, fir other disabilities it comes to my mind so many ways it can be useful.What is kind of difficult is to configure... but with a little help it is worth the trouble and to learn the _ows by those who don_ know much about apps, or settings.",0
5,"Worth it
  
",25.Jul.19,Yes,"Love this device already. Alexa is pretty accurate and does a Whole bunch of things. The size is perfect, making it easier to fit almost anywhere you desire. The Charcoal color is beautiful as well as the rgb light that changes color depending on the function or command provided. The device is very useful, especially for people like me that has a speaker without wireless/bluetooth connection and therefore Echo Dot can be used as a breach between my speaker and my iPhone. There are always discounts for this kind of products( I bought 2  instead of one for a very good price) . I recommend it",0
5,"It's a hands- free party
  
",25.Jul.19,Yes,"I love my Echo Dot.  It has great sound quality.I wanted it mainly for hands free music control. This was super good for my pool fun so I can play what a I want and shop music while swimming.I can do quite a bit stuff. I'm still learning.  They also send you notifications periodically to tell you other stuff you can do with Alexa.It can be a lil scary that she just listens all the time as I had a random conversation come in on my phone speaker after getting Alexa and the app, but just unplug it or mute it whenever you don't want it on.",0
5,"Can_ get enough of my Alexia!
  
",25.Jul.19,Yes,"This is my second Alexia and is a 3rd generation. I have a second generation in my upstairs and the newer one on the main level level of my home. I think the newer one has better sound, but both are excellent! So easy to just talk to Alexia to get any music I want, set alarms, find answers to questions, leave messages for myself, and ask her to turn off the music after a set time when I figure I_l be asleep. The very first set-up was a bit slow, but when I added on, it took me about 3 minutes and I am no tech whiz by any sense of the word. If my father were alive, he_ have one in every room. He loved technology, but never lived to see all the wonders we have today. If you_e wondering if it_ worth your money to buy one, stop wondering and get out and buy one! Emails come often that provide you with suggestions on new ways to increase your use! Why are you still reading this? Go buy one now!!!!",0
5,"Awesome little Dot
  
",25.Jul.19,Yes,"This little guy works great. I bought a fire TV cube a month or so earlier and I love the Alexa on that. I saw this at 50% off for prime day and I knew I couldn't pass the deal up. I have it in the same room as my cube currently. But it doesn't seem to cause much of a problem. Itll just got through which ever I'm closer to. Once I move out it should be much more useful in separate rooms. The color is great, very sleek and good for blending in. Speakers are pretty good. Not the best, but they definitely do the job.Overall very happy.",0
5,"Alexa, a convenient little assistant who's always willing to help.
  
",25.Jul.19,Yes,"For the longest time I had always seen commercials with Alexa, but I never really understood the hype. Then prime day came along, and I saw Alexa as one of the featured products. Seeing as the price drop for prime day was significant, I put in my order, and received Alexa the same day. I should mention that I got Alexa bundled with a smart plug (highly recommend doing so) Aside from allowing you to blast your music, Alexa also allows you to be ten times more laid back than usual. I have some string lights that I use during the night and having to get up, just to turn them off is not the move, but with Alexa on hand that process is so much easier. With just one quick blurb, I can stay in bed and drift off to sleep. I've only had my Alexa for about a week at this point but if you're looking for a speaker that can help you out a bit, I highly suggest placing an order. To close this review, I'd like to mention that if you do go out and buy an Alexa, she is very responsive to her name. I don't know what kind of microphones they have inside the little hockey puck that is Alexa but, I've said her name under my breath and she somehow still picks it up.",0

",25.Jul.19,Yes,"We have 2 of these in our house. One is located in our master bedroom/bathroom and the other in my son_ room.

I locked myself out of the house one morning on an early walk and was able to use the drop-in feature to wake up my son to let me in (I had accidentally left the dot in the master bedroom unplugged and my husband wouldn_ wake-up to his phone ringing). I might have scarred my son as he thought I was in his closet. Ha.",0

",25.Jul.19,Yes,"We LOVE our alexa devices! We now have 4 of them throughout the house. After a ""summer cold"" I had to spend a week in the guest room to avoid contaminating the rest of the house and there is no TV or radio back there. I ordered the Alexa dot for the back room and can play all of my pandora favorites on it. It is a GREAT device and we appreciate amazon offering this product at a discount during their July sale!",0
5,"Alexa is a fun device that is useful every day
  
",26.Jul.19,Yes,"Okay, Alexa is not perfect but she is amazing. The pros are the small size, the attractive appearance, the ability to use the devices as intercoms between rooms, and in general the fun of finding out all the useful  things you can do with the device. I like Alexa for setting a timer, or two, serving as an alarm clock, giving me all kinds of reminders to do tasks and take my medicine, she does a bang up job making grocery and shopping lists and sending them. to my smartphone, helping us cook by doing all kinds of recipe conversions, acting as a calculator, playing music of the type you like, telling you the weather and forecast, telling you the time, looking up word definitions, it_ really a lot of fun to use.. My husband built a little robot and works on getting them to talk to each other with hilarious results. I keep finding items in my amazon shopping cart Alexa put there because Little Bot told her to. , There was a refrigerator in there yesterday, I  must be careful when I check out! I have enjoyed playing games like Jeopardy with her.. I am sure there are many more things Alexa can  do that I have not hit on yet, but when in doubt if she can do something I give it a try. . A couple things that could be better. Alexa can_ deal with the _ast  if it_ more than a few seconds later.. I can_ ask her to tell me say, what time she reminded me to take my medicine...She can_ do repeated reminders unless they are in a calendar. Sometimes playing a game I cannot understand her voice, and she cannot understand mine. So I might give the correct answer in Jeopardy but it was not heard correctly. Music in the kitchen, like oldies or  rock sounds fine,but when I had her play a sleep story at night, the sound was slightly distorted. I would rather listen to,it from my iPad. Sometimes it gets confusing trying to tell her to stop a timer or add things to the grocery  list. You have to remember the right way to ask.  Sometimes she shuts off really fast, and I think I am talking to her from the next  room, but she_ already off. We have not had our devices long, so I imagine there is a lot more to learn.. We know  she is _pying on us, but generally it is not a concern. We can always just shut her off. I am peeved that every time you play Jeopardy , she tries to sell you hints! No way I know to turn this function off! I feel like I am finally in the 21st century and I am enjoying it.",0
5,"We absolutely LOVE our Alexa devices, Dots Fill Out Your House so Alexa is Everywhere
  
",26.Jul.19,Yes,"We absolutely LOVE our Alexa devices at our house, have 20 in active use, and actually own 26, 3 of them being this Echo Dot (3rd-gen).  There are uses for all the types.  We have most of our lighting standardized on TP-Link smart outlets, smart switches, &amp; smart bulbs.  In rare occasions the bridge between the two has gone down a few times over the years, and then you are forced to remember how much effort it is to walk over and turn everything on and off yourself versus Alexa doing it all for you :) .  Our most convenient use has been the backyard lighting all on smart bulbs to it is just a shout to turn them all on or off because each were on separate light switches in different sides of the house.  The point of Dots is so that they are cheap enough to put one in every room, so Alexa will hear and respond from the closest, wherever you may be in your house.The Echo Dot itself is great.  The 3rd-gen dot is a little bigger than the 2nd gen, is slightly upgraded but functions the same, and fits subtly nearly anywhere.  I have one on an outlet mount in a bathroom, which is nice to get the news, or weather, or anything while you get ready for bed or get up in the morning.  The speaker itself is just fine.  My wife honestly listens to music on it sometimes when it is just more convenient than when she is near a full Echo, and doesn't mind.  It is better than the speaker on my smart phone.  You can pair it with a Bluetooth speaker or headphones, which I find most convenient for my portable dot that I have on top of a portable battery for it.  That's what I use for toting into the garage or backyard to work on stuff.  Inside, I usually have an Echo or Show nearby that I use when I really want great sounding music.FYI: We have 4 Echos (original), 2 Echo Shows (original), 1 Echo Spot , 6 Echo Dots (2nd-gen) + 3 more not in current use displaced by our Echo Shows &amp; Spot, these 3 Echo Dots (3rd-gen), 1 ecobee SmartThermostat with Voice Control (with 9 room sensors) + 1 ecobee4 with Alexa that it replaced, 1 Fire TV with Voice Remote, 1 Echo Auto, 1 Garmin Speak, and 1 smart watch with Alexa as default -- all of which listen and respond as a smart speaker.  I honestly miss it when I'm in the garage or out outside my house when I start to say Alexa to ask something and she's not there :) .  Yes, I even have a dot with a portable battery for such cases.",0
3,"Got for free so...
  
",26.Jul.19,Yes,"This device is ok, I guess.  I thought it was just a speaker to be honest and it was free on a special so no complaints really.  I just don't get the point of it or Alexa really.  I thought I was going to be able to use this as a speaker for my computer (I could not).  It can be used as a speaker only to use Alexa as far as I can tell.  Alexa is ok.  I find it difficult to remember her name but not allowed to rename her.  Also, really 3 syllable name necessary??  When I say ""play"" she interrupts my sentence and says ""here's something I think you like""...geesh Alexa, wait your turn lol, I was trying to tell you what to play!! She does this repeatedly maybe every other time I say ""play"".  Super confusing is the fact that you can't use it to play Amazon Video sound through...all other kinds of video apps there Netflix, etc. but no Amazon Video????  She can't search Google and give you info like Siri would, she can only search Wikipedia.  She makes random dings and doesn't know why...when I ask her she says she doesn't know.  Aside from setting a reminder, telling me the weather, and playing music apps I can't find much use for...and its not really loud enuf to play music on in my opinion unless you are sitting right near.  Good sound though for sure and was not too difficult to set up with Alexa.Update:  After repeatedly asking Alexa if she could bluetooth pair with my laptop and getting a 3 beat tone in response (no words, no answer, just the same noise over and over), I searched the internet for a while and finally figured out how to do it.  So I originally wrote this device could not be used as a bluetooth speaker but was wrong.  You can pair to any bluetooth device (in theory) and use it as a speaker for that device which is nice because I wanted to play my own music and this allows me to do so.Update 2:  I'm so sick of this device making noises all day long and not being able to tell me what they're about!  It goes on and on for hours with no end so I've given up on it and can no longer keep it plugged in due to the incessant noises it makes for no reason or at least no reason that it can tell me or I can figure out.  Good thing it was free or I'd really be upset!!",0
4,"Good, but...
  
",26.Jul.19,Yes,"This Dot came as a free device from a purchase during Amazon Prime Days and, based on my daughter's Dot, I did not have high hopes for good quality sound. I was happily wrong. The sound is deep and rich and quite loud enough. The device itself, of course, is compact enough to fit pretty much anywhere - I have mine in my bathroom, a space not quite large enough for a full-size Echo - and is unobtrusive.There are two problems, though I think the first one is more related to the smart plug I have more than the Dot itself. It does not like to be paired. Even though my Alexa app shows it is properly connected, over the past couple of weeks, the Dot has disconnected without my doing anything. The second problem is that if I have a Bluetooth device activated anywhere nearby - and that has proven to be a pretty large area - the Dot does not connect to my Alexa Everywhere group.As a result of those two issues, I have docked my Echo Dot (third generation) one star.",0
1,"Fire hazard!
  
",26.Jul.19,Yes,"It is really convenient being able to use the voice control and automation features. Super handy. I was really starting to like having the Alexa around, I had one in my  bedroom and one in the living room.. Except I woke up in the middle of the night with my room full of smoke and the outlet my Alexa was plugged into was on fire. I quickly turned off the breaker and extinguished the fire, but it really scared me considering I would have been leaving for work two hours after and it could of burned down my apartment with my kitten in it. I'm not sure if I can trust any Amazon devices after this. This was way to close of a call. I'd recommend checking your insurance plan for fire coverage and potentially upgrading before installing these in your house. Mine lasted maybe a month or two before bursting into flames during my sleep, but your milage may vary.",0
3,"Works well...  if you have a new phone
  
",26.Jul.19,Yes,"This review applies to my particular situation (Though I doubt it is at all unique) First, the PROS: What it does, it does very well.  Reminders, alarms, random info, conversions, jokes.  It does integrate with Amazon Music Unlimited very well. I have yet to ask for a song or album that it couldn't find. The CONS: I'm annoyed that so much of its abilities and performance are dependant on the Alexa app on your phone. I don't have a new phone so my echo dot is severely limited as to its functionality and abilities.  I did check the availability and compatibility of the Alexa app on my phone prior to purchase. The app installed and gave no indication that it would be mostly non-functional. The app doesn't even have the Alexa voice prompt. My main complaint is that it can't access my contacts or make/ answer phone calls until I buy a new phone.",0
5,"GREAT FOR A SMALL DEVICE
  
",26.Jul.19,Yes,"The sound quality is very good for such a small device, a little bit bigger then a hickey puck, voice quality is fine but for music you should route this through speakers.  We attach ours to our table top Bose to play music.  The voice recognition is good.  Tow issue keep the device from 5 star.  One issue is the device responding sounds or words from the TV and the second is not responding to commands if to speak the command right after saying ALEXA.The set up was very easy, about the same as setting up the Kindle Fire.  If you can connect a device to a WIFI network then you can set up the echo.  We are finding new uses everyday,  Today we used it to translate into Spanish.  Well worth the money.",0
5,"This little dude is a good sounding Dot! AND IT HAS A CLOCK IN IT TOO!
  
",26.Jul.19,Yes,"I have numerous Echos, and have given some as gifts and was waiting for a chance to get one of these new dots. I had read the sound is much better than previous Dot models and I am impressed. This one little dude sounds as good as the full sized original Echo Cylinder... I don't now how they did it, but it actually ""hears"" better than the second generation Dots as well. Nice little piece to add to my large collection of Echo products and other smart home items. The clock is ""Smart"" as well... just set alarms by telling it to set a daily alarm or an alarm for tonight, or any specific day and time... it does a great job of making noise enough to wake up a standard adult.",0
3,"Something wasn't programmed correctly for music playback as the previous, same device.
  
",26.Jul.19,Yes,"This one works fine but one big programming issue I've yet to find a resolve. Lightning took out the previous one. This one will not play songs it does recognize (find), only samples.  My spotify will not work with it but it didnt in the other one anyway. BUT the former one, one version older, did play any song in complete.  I've tried all the suggestions.  I'm hoping there is a customer service with a person I will be able to find and fix the issue.It's for a blind man and is his only technology that's very helpful for the caretaker for reminders but he always admired and adored his previous one.I pray this issue will have a solution. There arent many technologies for the non technical blind. Especially cell phones.  You have to SEE where to touch to simply answer one.I can't give a 4 star review until this is resolved.  Makes no sense if the prior one worked fine.",0
5,"The best ever alarm clock!
  
",26.Jul.19,Yes,"I love it!  I use it to wake me up in the morning. I set the alarm in ascending mode.  I wake up refreshed not feeling being attacked by the alarm.It_ the best alarm clock:  Now I don_ have to grope for my phone and squint at it while trying to find the snooze/stop icon (God forbid you press stop when you meant to press snooze!).  Just for this feature alone, I got my money_ worth.It_ a great reminder too. In addition to listening to Alexa_ very soothing voice announcing the reminder, you get a notification on your phone too.Plus all the other great features: listen to prime music, news, traffic, weather, track your orders, etc.",0
5,"Smart house is no longer dumb........ we love it!
  
",26.Jul.19,Yes,"we have a mix of Echo Shows and Echo Dots throughout our house... with over 50 plus devices now integrated into our routine,  we couldn't be happier with the relatively low cost foundation that is Alexa.  We use her for setting alarms, controlling lights, TV's, security systems, doorbells, sprinklers, doors, thermostat, etc.... we love it!  In comparison to 2nd generation Dot's this 3rd generation is a wonderfully designed upgrade.  The expanded speaker is perfect for listening to music or whatever request you have for Alexa.. the lower cost of this device makes it a no question purchase for upgrading or expanding coverage.",0
5,"Pleasantly surprise on the many uses
  
",26.Jul.19,Yes,"Pleasantly surprised on the many uses for it.  Purchased to be my son_ room speaker as he is becoming a teenager and has a phone but not allowed to use at home.  We wanted a speaker that he would be able to listen to his music without the phone. This device did the trick and much more.  Now he sets up his own alarms, tells Alexa to play his favorite music, search for stuff for him (even his phone), and we are finding more every day.  So if you want a device that will facilitate your life, get it.P.S.It even finds clean music, a need for all of us parents.",0
2,"Echo Plus... Nice product
  
",26.Jul.19,Yes,"I have an Echo Plus understands English fine, great product.... caused me to purchase 2 of the hockey puck echo dots 3rd gen ... it doesn_ understand a word of English... $29 door stop. Get the Echo Plus... with the 3rd gen Dot... You will have to repeat nearly every time, speak clearer each time... It will turn off other systems in the house randomly when you call out a command... and not honor the command you gave the Dot... Echo should appologize to any Amazon Loyal customers, give a great deal on deal on their star ship Echo Plus....",0
5,"Extra Easy Set-up and Better Speaker
  
",26.Jul.19,Yes,"This version of the Echo Dot has a couple of improvements over the 2nd generation.  When adding to a group of Echo Dots, the set-up is much easier.  Instead of going into the Alexa app and adding networks and completing multiple steps, all you have to do is plug it in.  The lights flash for a few minutes, and then it is ready.  Wow!  It also has a better speaker than Gen 2.  Gen 3 without an external speaker is not quite as good as Gen 2 with external speakers, but it is close.  Pretty impressive for its size.  It is only slightly larger than the Gen 2.I'm not sure where Motion Detection comes from in the rating list.  It has no motion detection at all.  I didn't expect it to have it, the box doesn't mention it, and both waving my hands near it and shaking it has no effect.  I simply didn't rate it for that feature.",0
5,"Great Upgrade, Sound Quality is Amazing
  
",26.Jul.19,Yes,"Bought this on a Prime Day deal and have been very happy with the purchase.  We have a 2nd Generation Echo and a first Generation Dot (as well as the newest Google Mini) - and the sound quality on this product seems superior to all of them.  Very simple to set up and we love how it integrates with the rest of our Amazon Smart Speakers.  The ""Announce"" feature, for example, can be a fun and useful tool when you have them scattered throughout a large home.  There are so many uses for this product but one of my favorites is scheduling reminders.  You will get voice alerts at the given day/time, as well as a phone notification from the Alexa App.  The streaming music via Amazon Prime provides a nice selection without needing to upgrade to a music subscription.  Also, great for white noise while going to sleep.  The new generation (we have Heather Gray) is very sleek looking as well  You won't be disappointed with this purchase.",0
5,"I've got to admit...
  
",26.Jul.19,Yes,"I've always been against having stuff like this in the house listening in on your every move - but after buying a Ring Doorbell and this came with it we've had a lot of great laughs with it.  The play music feature is pretty cool, and the sound isn't bad.  It's great for kids so they can ask questions to their heart's content without having unsupervised access to the internet.  I've enjoyed mine so much I bought another for my mom - she'll get a kick out of it I'm sure.",0
5,"Amazing!
  
",26.Jul.19,Yes,"I don't think I've had a chance to use all of the functions, but just having the ""drop in"" feature is amazing! I love telling Alexa to add things to my shopping list and it shows up on my app on my phone! I bought two and put one in our kitchen and one in our bedroom. My daughter, who is four years old, loves that she ask Alexa to play her favorite songs. All around an amazing product and I highly recommend it to everyone I know!",0
5,"BIG sound, little package - same great Echo functionality
  
",26.Jul.19,Yes,Bought this little guy for our workout room.  I wanted a discreet and most importantly - SMALL - smart speaker that had the exact same capability as the Echo in our kitchen.  This little speaker delivers amazingly BIG SOUND for our 20ft x 15ft sized workout room.  Same great flawlessly functioning software as the regular Echo too.  Would definitely buy again.  I just wish there was cordless version.,0
3,"Not worth money - just by a better Bluetooth speaker and use your phone to control
  
",26.Jul.19,Yes,"It is actually kind of fun to set this device up, try different voices and give voice commands to tell you the outside temperature or play Amazon music.  But I was able to do this with just my phone and a bluetooth speaker.I find that the device frequently does not respond to voice commands.  For example, if I command it to set a timer, it does set the timer and the timer does go off but I then cannot get it respond to shut the timer off!!!  I literally have to unplug it and start over.Some documentation says it can send SMS texts but it can't.  It  can only communicate with people who have other Alexa devices.  This is a significant drawback.Save your money - the technology doesn't appear to be ready yet.  Lots of good Bluetooth speakers out there that sound much better than this.  Alexa is kind of like a well-meaning but green intern in this device.",0
5,"Good product
  
",26.Jul.19,Yes,"This is my 7th addition to my ECHO home.  The new design looks great and the sound is far better than the prior models!  with this being an Amazon device, I didn't understand why it took over a week to receive the product, however buying these online at Amazon as an additional device, they come pre-setup, just plug and go, it knows how to connect and is pretty much  ready to go!  Much better than buying in store.",0
5,"Echo Dot: Alexa
  
",26.Jul.19,Yes,"I'm not very tech savvy and this is my very first purchase of this type. I love the sound quality and how I can ask for a song or a genre and the dot will play it. I am still learning all that this type of device can do for me. My apartment is not ""smart"" so my dot can't do a lot of things. Pricing was great on Prime Day so that's why I purchased the dot.",0
2,"Jury_ still out on this.....
  
",27.Jul.19,Yes,So far I_ not overly impressed with the Echo system first off its a pain to set up literally worse than the Fire tablet it is limited to do very basic commands I was expecting a more interactive content available. Second it can_ even pronounce my name properly or hear my commands to make a list example errands comes up as Aron_ simple things like that are irritating. Forces you to sign up for Amazon music due to not having some basic classics like Free Allright now in Prime and limited classical music in Prime. I found out the hard way that it does stay constantly on at times and if you set it for drop in don_ be surprised with what you get... being highly sensitive to sound and noise my hearing is superior to most people so it was very annoying to hear the constant hum of the speaker even when not in use. I_ not impressed by the features boring content who needs an app for making you feel good aka damn girl? It is good for daily weather (won_ give you long term forecast) limited news (hate fox had to change it who_ pocket are they in?) little tidbits are ok but I wanted a more intelligent conversation and can_ stand the female only voice either but that_ tolerable. All in all I have unplugged it to shut down the constant hum from the speaker the speaker itself is great very good quality sound and we do enjoy the music very much. Keep working on this Amazon you_l improve hopefully it was worth the price on Prime day.,0
4,"Pretty darn cool
  
",27.Jul.19,Yes,My wife refuses to let me use this in the main part of our home so the three I purchased have been quarantined to my personal spaces. I spend most of my working day in my shop with my hands dirty and hence the reason for my original purchase. I was constantly having to take my gloves of to change what I was listen to on Sirius XM but not anymore.All of my laptops and phones are Apple and I stopped using Siri long ago because it's basically junk. Anytime you ask her a question she says she doesn't know or just directs you to a webpage. Alexa on the other hand will actually answer you questions which is amazing! We also recently purchased an Emerson smart thermostat which I was easily able to connect and can now control the temp with ease. Alexa is also such better at understanding me when compared with Siri.For me the biggest down side of Alexa is that I don't believe it has the ability to send text messages from my iPhone which is a big bummer.The audio is about a 6/10 so that could be a bit better as well. I still use my Bose portable speaker to listen to music.,0
4,"I would like to see this device have an internal  battery; so it does not have to be plugged in
  
",27.Jul.19,Yes,"I love having the Alexa, and I have the smart plug, but I just learned how to use the plug;  I recommend this to anyone, who likes music,  well like it_ good for alarms, reminders I am grocery shopping list.  Complaint/  it has to be plugged into a power source at all time, to work and that is the only downfall  I thought the smart plug would make it able to work indoors/at home without being plugged in....  but that was not the case. Alexa works amazing but she still struggles with voice recognition a little the only other complaint that I would have, is  the device does not like to connect to a public Wi-Fi?  I take it on trips like to a hotel, for business.  I have to use my hotspot on my Phone or home internet or it does not want to work properly.  Can be frustrating and use a lot of my data on my hotspot. I have unlimited data on my iPhone but not unlimited on my hotspot area I don_ know if there is a way to fix it to where she will work on any type of Internet? I would love for someone to assist me with that",0
5,"Great sound and so extremely versatile!
  
",27.Jul.19,Yes,"This thing is incredibly easy to set up and use. It can do all kinds of things besides play music or books, which sound great BTW .Right now I am listening to the sound of a thunderstorm and rain, my favorite sounds in the world, while typing this. I can also use it to control my microwave oven. If I had the correct bulbs _ and outlet controls I could also use it to turn my lights on and off or even control my thermostat.I would have bought one long ago but just didn_ have the money, but when they went on sale for $22 on prime day it was just too good a deal to pass up. I will be buying two more for the kitchen and living room the next time they go on sale again.",0
5,"Amazing!
  
",27.Jul.19,Yes,"We love our echo dots! We bought one the very first night of Amazon Prime Days. We got it the next day and fell in love, so ordered 2 more. We have one in our kitchen, one in our room, and one in our kids room. We love asking Alexa questions, what the weather will be, adding stuff to our shopping list, playing music. I bet there_ so much we have to learn!One of the reasons we originally got the echo dot, was because i read a review that people use it as a white noise machine for their kids. Which we decided to try out instead of using an app on our phones. The sound is amazing from the echo, and our kids fall asleep faster with the noise coming from the echo.I_ really so glad we bought these! I was really worried i wasn_ going to enjoy them being in our house. Can_ wait until next amazon prime days to see what other Alexa toys we will score!",0
5,"A step up.
  
",27.Jul.19,Yes,"This my third echo device.  I bought myself a second generation Dot and fell in love with Alexa.  The sound is an improvement over the second gen Dot but it still doesn't rival an Echo.  I have slowly been smarting my house and all the Alexa products are a breeze to setup for that purpose.  I can seamlessly walk through my house and yell for Alexa to turn on or off lights, remind me to check the laundry or play my favorite song.  My only complaint is the same one I had with previous generations. PUT A NAIL HOLE ON THE BOTTOM SO IT CAN BE WALL MOUNTED without buy additional equipment.",0
5,"ALEXA STRIKES AGAIN
  
",27.Jul.19,Yes,Alexa strikes againI had the 2nd generation Alexa for a few years now and didn't think of upgrading. I decided on prime day a few weeks ago to upgrade to this updated 3rd generation.The speaker is better. It has bass and depth that is immediately noticeable. I can hear outside the room it's located in.Alexa can also hear me at further distances.The fabric on outside is a great quality and texture. There's no need for a cover as this matches well with nearby furnishings.If you are considering upgrading its a great move. Go for it. You won't be disappointed,0
4,"A good assistant, but limited
  
",27.Jul.19,Yes,"I bought an Echo Dot and a Google Home Mini at the same time to evaluate which type I should use.  Both were priced identically. After several months of testing, I found that the Google Home Mini handled more of my requests than the Echo Dot.  There were many questions asked of Alexa and she had no answer; the Google Assistant could answer all the questions that Alexa could not.  There was only one question over this time that Google could not answer, but Alexa could.  Also, the Google Home Mini can control all the smart lights I am using; The Echo Dot can also control most of them, but not GE C bulbs.  Also, the Echo Dot is not able to control Chromecast devices connected to television sets.  Based on this evaluation, I decided to buy many additional Google Home minis.",0
1,"Skip it....
  
",27.Jul.19,Yes,"So, I like the idea of this product, but the sound quality is TERRIBLE... there_ too much air noise or something in it, not sure how to describe. It reminds me very much of listening to a cassette tape. There_ no crystal clear sound quality here for sure. I bought a $30 Oontz speaker a few years back that_ by far better. Disappointed I threw away the packaging, or I_ definitely be returning!",0
5,"Good new or as an upgrade. Exudes quality.
  
",27.Jul.19,Yes,"Upgraded from 2nd gen echo puck, much, much better sound quality. Unit is a touch larger but with the fabric cover but much more elegant. Definitely worth the upgrade. I believe the microphones are much better at picking up commands. The biggest upgrade is the sound quality it's not tinny, it's got body and it's much more enjoyable to listen to especially talk radio.",0
1,"FAULTY broke after 60 days.  DO NOT BUY!  2
  
",28.Jul.19,Yes,Bought this one In May of this year.  Yesterday it just kept spinning the blue light NO LONGER WORKS.  Not even 2 months since purchase.  I have bought a total of 5 echo dots.  The ones from 2017 still going strong.  I bought 3 new generation this year.  Two still working.  Because this one died after only 2 months I will NOT ever buy another ECHO dot. TIME to move to google!  Oh I can't return the faulty one due to 30 day return policy.  Less than 24 hours after the 1st 3rd generation echo dot died another one bit the dust.  I now have only ONE 3rd generation left. DO NOT BUY these they quit after only two months!  No return policy rotten to the core,1
5,"It_ a Savior
  
",28.Jul.19,Yes,"Echo dot is really neat. It was kind of hard setting up the Alexa app to it, but I got it figured out. It was on my end that made it difficult (internet issues). I have two children. Sometimes they can be a little unruly and talk back. I discover that with the Alexa app, there_ this thing on there called _ommunication and if you go on there, your able to type any message in.. no matter where your at and it will relay the message right to the echo dot. You do not even have to be in the house. I use this app with the echo dot for my children. I type their names in and state _e good, _o fighting girls, or some other message as if they are being watched and they stop what ever bad behavior they are doing. My daughters get a kick out of it, because I also use it if they are being good and say thank you for picking that up, or good job for sharing etc.",0
5,"A little dynamo!
  
",28.Jul.19,Yes,"Bought this on Prime Day for only $22 and should have gotten at least two!  I love that I can choose any genre of music and the dot plays it.  The sound quality is quite good.  I love the San Francisco Giants baseball team and Alexa can tell me what time the game is on and play the radio broadcast.  This is huge because I live in the central valley and our radio reception for the game broadcasts is often staticky or weak.  My grandchildren enjoy hearing Alexa's jokes and asking ""her"" questions.  I don't have any smart lights or other devices yet so I haven't tried that aspect of it.  So far, it is one of my favorite purchases.",0
3,"It works but software is far from flawless
  
",28.Jul.19,Yes,"The Echo Dot ""works"" great, until you see how well it works with all of the other things on your Wifi that it is supposed to be compatible with. Be prepared to go online to see whether others are having similar problems. Everyone's Wifi setup can be different with different brands and products on their internet of things. As a result, one persons fix may not work for you. At least that has been my experience. I hope they keep updating the Dot's firmware. If the compatibility issues were mostly fixed, I'd give 4 or 5 stars to the Echo Dot.",0
4,"CRACKED THE CONNECTION ISSUE
  
",28.Jul.19,Yes,"I wasn't really interested about any of the Alexa products but on Prime Day when this puppy got slashed from 50 bucks to 25 bucks, I decided to give it a go. I got it thinking it might be the start of something new but like many others was instantly annoyed when I couldn't connect and couldn't find any help online. It took me all night but after going through every single setting on my phone (Android S8), I think I finally cracked the code and boy is it stupid easyyyyyy. I never write reviewes but the pain of not connecting the damn thing is real so I thought I'd share. SO, if you have an Android and can't connect -1. GO TO SETTINGS2. GO TO CONNECTIONS3. GO TO DATA USAGE4. GO TO RESTRICT NETWORKS5. Here you will find that the wifi that is associated with the Echo, for me it's Amazon-TV5, is turned off AKA your phone's default settings doesn't let you connect to the Echo. Turn the sidebar off.6. Proceed with the regular instructions and you should be good to go!I hope this works for you!Aside from this, I'm very much enjoying my new toy! _",0

",28.Jul.19,Yes,"I have the Echo tower installed in my bedroom. It is good there but when I was in another part of the house I would have to go to the bedroom I decided to add an Echo Dot in my living room and love it there as well. Alexa knows my voice and has learned spe ial phrases l used. Instead of using flash briefings I as Alexa ""what's up"" and I  get all my flash briefings. Sometimes it is like I can almost have a conversation.",0
5,"I'm not tech savvy, love it!
  
",28.Jul.19,Yes,"I was in a wreck 5 years ago and have brain damage. Alexa with the dot is a life changer for me. I programmed my own ""routines"", which is the echo way of saying when I tell Alexa specific phrases she then responds with a series of things I have preset. This has been helpful with my mornings and getting kids up. Reminding me to start lunch, or complete chores/tasks. I love the music quality. And that with just my voice I can turn down or pause the music.",0
5,"Alexa makes so many little chores hands-free.
  
",28.Jul.19,Yes,"I resisted getting Alexa for so long, but now I wish I hadn_ been so resistant. I love it! She plays my Audible selections for me, which is very nice. She sets reminders and if you purchase smart devices and smart plugs she can control your house for you. I have quickly grown accustomed to having her there and she really adds an additional layer to the usefulness of my digital entertainment and accessories.",0
5,"Echo Dot Excellence
  
",28.Jul.19,Yes,"This is the fourth Echo product I've purchased -- and I can only give a rave review. Alexa works great and has become a big part of my daily routine. I don't know if this will ever be fixed or it is just part of the Echo products, but it in annerving when Alexa starts to talk to you without having been asked... A little creepy, but a small thing in comparison to all the things the Echos are good at doing.",0
5,"So far so good
  
",29.Jul.19,Yes,"We've only had our Alexa devices setup for about two weeks now, so we're definitely still working out the kinks. With that said, this is a review of everything I've noticed of our entire Alexa ecosystem, which includes 2x Echo Dots, 2x Echo Spots, 2x refurbished Echos, and 1x Echo Sub:Pros: Individually, they all work exactly as they should ALMOST all the time (more on that in the cons section). They all look good, and aren't big, ugly hunks of metal and plastic taking up space in your house. They were all incredibly easy to get through initial setup (except the Echo Sub, more below). Music sounds good in all of them, to include the Echo Dots (but it sounds GREAT on the Echos, and fantastic on the Echo/Sub pair).Cons: The voice recognition is almost too good for its own good. We have a fairly open floor plan, with an Echo Spot in the living room and an Echo in the kitchen. Sometimes they both hear a demand, and the wrong device (meaning the one farther away) will respond. I find myself occasionally whispering to an Echo device so its friends don't butt in to the convo.The Echo Sub needed to be reset 3x when I first got it/went to set it up. I had to log in/out of the app a couple times as well before it was recognized and would actually pair to an Echo.Sometimes Alexa tells me she can't complete a request, then my wife (who uses Alexa far less often than I do) will ask the same request and it works...and vice versa. We haven't figured out what we're doing/saying or not doing/not saying for these discrepancies to happen, but hopefully that'll work itself out with time.The most irritating issue I have so far is getting music to play on the ""Everywhere"" group. Sometimes I say ""Alexa play music everywhere"" and it just doesn't do it. Sometimes it'll play on only some of the devices, and sometimes it'll only play on the device I was speaking to. Our house is two stories, and we have two kids and a dog, so we spend a ridiculous amount of our time cleaning/walking up and down the stairs. A big part of the reason I bought these was for the music to fill the house while cleaning, and it oftentimes requires me to spend some time arguing with Alexa to get that to happen. It's even gotten to the point where I've had to go into the app and manually select ""Everywhere,"" because the voice command just won't work.Individual components:2x Echo Dots (w/ separately purchased wall mounts): No complaints. They setup just fine, and work perfectly. They're actually bigger than I thought they would be, and look a little clunky mounted to the wall, but overall they don't mess up our aesthetic enough for me to dock them a star or anything. 5/5 would recommend.2x Echo Spots: No complaints again. These were the first two devices we bought, and they worked so well I decided to buy the other devices. My favorite part of these is their ability to pull up security cam footage. My desk is in the basement, so it's nice to say ""Alexa show me the driveway"" and see who just pulled in, or to say ""Alexa show me the front door"" when the doorbell rings. I paired these will some web cam covers (also bought on Amazon, of course) so Jeffy and his crew can't record me all day long.2x refurbished Echos (in charcoal): I bought these to play music, and they sound amazing. We'll see how they hold up, given that they're refurbished equipment, but I have my fingers crossed. They also look great, and are not an eye sore like other speakers.1x Echo Sub: The only device that gave me an issue with the setup process. For that, I'd honestly give the Sub 4/5 stars because it really was a pain in the butt getting it properly hooked up. It gave me issues not just connecting to Wifi, but also when pairing with an Echo. Lots of logging in/out of the app, resetting the Sub. Irritating, to say the least. However, with that one star docked, I'd give it a SOLID 4/5 stars. This thing sounds GREAT. I'm a huge music lover, but hip hop/rap is really where my loyalty lies. And I NEED bass when I jam, and this thing delivers bass in spades. Even with the setup issue, I'm planning on buying another for in the basement. If Amazon ever makes a waterproof version, I'll buy one for outside for bbqs/parties too.",0
4,"Satisfied Overall
  
",29.Jul.19,Yes,"I'm just getting used to the whole Alexa thing so it is still a little early in my overall expectations, but generally speaking, I like it. Disappointed in the Dot speaker quality, way too easy to overdrive it. (Note to Amazon: partner with an outfit like Cambridge Soundworks for your audio; Google is outpacing you for the same dollars)Speech recognition learning seems slow but it's getting there. And Alexa is somewhat stilted and precise in getting certain commands to work smoothly. You'll be having to memorize the dialogue for your favorite routines since Alexa isn't very intuitive in learning what you want.I did buy a few smart plugs and I do like being able to turn on/off lights and appliances with ease. If I were a homeowner,  I would definitely do my entire house.Having audio versions of many of the things I typically use my smartphone for I also like, such as medication reminders, upcoming events, birthdays, etc.In fact, I'm thinking of getting a Dot for an elderly friend, I think these could be invaluable in the home of the elderly.The basic ""Guard Home"" feature is a nice touch, although the addition of a dB-based alarm function would be nice and what I would think reasonably simple to code.In my opinion, a lot to like with a lot of room for improvement. I went in this direction rather than Google out of a certain loyalty to Amazon, I hope they can make the needed improvements.",0
4,"Bigger not better
  
",29.Jul.19,Yes,"Same as previous Generation-Speaker is a LOT more Bass(ie) still trying to get that sorted - no matter how I play it still sounds muffled and bass -Bigger not sure needed to be ....Same flaws the _istening mic either answers to anything regardless of wake word - or you have to scream for it to hear youOn scale of 1-10 on understanding, maybe a 4 i articulate my words I do not us slang rarely contractions still gets it all wrongFind lately I have to repeat my command up to three time before it is actually executed even though Alexa signals it did it ...They are so concerned with either staying ahead of a curve or being the first the the simple single commands are left to rot an ruin  - as a rule for what they charge for the _igher toy - not worth it stick to the least expensive of the group - maybe when they pull themselves together and make the simple commands flawless then and only then should they be considered worth of the prices the command for the upper toy - till then this is nothing but a kids toy that functions Maybe 40% of the time with out glitching on the simple commands - forget the more complex ones",0
4,"Love using it  can improve voice and Alexa integrations
  
",29.Jul.19,Yes,"Using this echo dot is convenient and entertaining. The alexa integration makes life easier  you can play songs easily, know the weather, set reminders, and so much more! It_ not 100% perfect though and sometimes it gets stressful to repeat yourself hence the 4 stars.Tip: Set up everything properly! If Alexa dont understand your first or second request, just be clear and tell her what you want.Cons: I ordered during Prime Day and the shipment was delayed 3x but Amazon support handled my complaints it pretty good.",1
5,"Nice upgrade!!
  
",29.Jul.19,Yes,"We added a couple new Echo dots to our home for Amazon prime day, we're super happy with this upgraded version!! The sound quality is a huge improvement.  Esthetically pleasing to the eye, and works as intended.  The echo dot is such a neat tool to be able to use for little alarms, reminders, and lists.  The question of the day is a huge thing in our household as well, and on/off functions of smart switches and firesticks.  We really enjoy the Dot and like having multiple around the house to make everyday things just a tad easier.  (Black/charcoal has been on backorder for weeks now, we still have yet to receive that one.  Shipping on that has been a tad disappointing, but we know its worth the wait)",0
5,"Kinda tricky to use !!
  
",29.Jul.19,Yes,"Bought this to go with my ring door bell and waiting on that to show up, but in meantime set the echo dot up. Set up is pretty easy and straightforward.  Cant figure out how to pair 2 phones at a time to it. Maybe you cant with this model. But once I was playing my music from my phone, the next day when I opened and played a message from messenger, the sound played thru the echo dot. It seems that all my ""media"" is now playing thru this device!! The only way I could figure out to to unpair my phone with echo dot. I haven't had the time to go back and see if I can still call thru this since my phone is not paired now. I think a call to customer support will be next !!",0
5,"Sounds good, dirt cheap (on Prime Day anyway)
  
",29.Jul.19,Yes,"Very surprised with the sound quality on this version. I wouldn't rank it as high-quality, however in a small space at low volume it sounds just fine for music. Alexa as a product is available through this device which is obviously it's main selling point and things like white noise and various notifications and access to simple queries have all been very welcomed and enjoyable.If you want to listen to music in a large room or at high volumes I would encourage looking towards the larger Echo products. They would be worth the investment for the sound quality and volume upgrade in my opinion.",0
5,"Loved it so much I bought more!
  
",29.Jul.19,Yes,My electric company gave me one as a promo.  I loved it so much are order more for the rest of the house.. and since they have lowered the price it was easy!  I listen to Amazon music and the speaker quality is excellent for such a small speaker.  It doesn't take up much room but the sound is good.  The reminders and alarms that are voice activated are so helpful.  Alexa remind me in 10 minutes to take dinner out of the oven.  Alexa wake me up at 6 in the morning..so easy and so helpful. really where are you going to find a quality speaker to listen to radio or music for that price... And have Alexa too.,0
3,"Cool, but there are flaws.
  
",29.Jul.19,Yes,"This Echo is sleek and elegant, however I find that my Gen 2 dot would recognize my voice way easier. I almost have to yell sometimes for this echo to hear me, even if there is no sound in the room. I keep this echo about 10 feet away and it just can_ beat me sometimes??? Also, I bought this echo hoping the sound would be way better for music but honestly it isn_ that much different. Amazon added just a smidge of bass but it really isn_ the greatest. It_ worth the price, just wasn_ what I was expecting.",0
5,"Works great!!
  
",29.Jul.19,Yes,"This is the first echo dot I have gotten. The sound is an improvement over my Echo that I got a couple of years ago. I enjoy it so far. The only problem I had was with the setup. I couldn't get it to set up on my fire tablet with the Alexa app. It couldn't find my echo dot and the page kept saying, ""looking for device"". I tried to do it manually through the tablet and that didn't work either. In desperation I downloaded the Alexa app to my Iphone. That worked beautifully. It found the dot quickly and the setup was easy after that!",0
5,"Alexa works great!
  
",29.Jul.19,Yes,"The Echo Dot is pretty cool.  I got the white one which looks pretty chic!  Alexa responds well.  Once in a while she doesn't understand what I am asking, but I do have a bit of a Latina accent...lol....Looking online, there are many questions I can ask her.  She keeps my shopping list, adds items and deletes as I ask, she sets a timer, has recipes, sang me happy birthday, and welcomes me home.  It's really pretty, I just wish they wouldn't have run out because I need about three of them.  I also bought the wall mount and currently waiting for it.It arrived super quick!",0
5,"The perfect supplement to my Echo 2nd generation!
  
",29.Jul.19,Yes,"I hesitated before buying the Echo Dot (3rd Generation).  I was very concerned that the sound quality would be too too _inny. Even though the sound is not as as rich as my taller Echo 2nd Generation, it is absolutely fine for what I was looking for.  It_ nice to have the extra speaker in another room of the house. I call it by another name rather than Alexa.  Honestly, the sound is not bad at all; I was actually impressed with it, coming from such a small size! I am very glad I purchased this item!",0
2,"Eh.
  
",29.Jul.19,Yes,"The dot is somewhat useful for reminders when I don't have the quick moment to write down a note or reminder. The alarm sound selection is small and is kind of redundant when you can make a routine for the same purpose.The Alexa app is a total mess, not user-friendly or organized very well. No way to search in-app for what you are looking for, and there is no way to make a routine for select days; only weekends/every day/weekdays.Alexa is also not that ""smart."" She is not intuitive and I find little point in the speaker. I use it more for a music speaker than anything else.Communication is also broad and not specific to a speaker. If a user calls my account it rings on all family dots instead of a specific dot like I want.",0
5,"Work fine if I am within ear-shot of either Alexa and without my smart phone.
  
",29.Jul.19,Yes,"Alexa understands my voice and what I am saying, than I do hers. I guess that is because I have been busy and therefore neglected to adjust her treble and base, volume only. Music reproduction is fine. Some of my problem may be the fact that I have my own huge personal library of music and sound equipment and mentally compare it to her sound. Thing is, I can't up and take that equipment from room to room where I can the two Alexa's. She's a winner.",0
5,"This is my sixth Alexa.
  
",29.Jul.19,Yes,"I have Alexas all over the house. I like its ability to answer questions, give weather reports, and control lighting. The lighting control is kind of iffy sometimes. I have to reset the hub to make it work properly. I don't know if the problem lies with Alexa or the smart switches. Is Alexa a spy for the Powers That Be? I don't know but as long as she can give me information about almost anything, she's welcome in my house.",0
5,"Great Companion
  
",29.Jul.19,Yes,I brought this item for my Mom and I also bought one for myself and I simply enjoy it. Its' great to have this thing to ask questions and get answers to. That's why I call it the companion. I just wish it was a physical robot where I can ask her to go get me something at the fridge but I can imagine that will happen eventually.  My Mom is in love with Alexa and the funny thing is that she argues with her...lol! Great product.,0
5,"So convenient
  
",29.Jul.19,Yes,"Searching through the ""skills"" has shown us that we were missing out on so much functionality! When we started adding more and more skills, we knew that having these in most rooms of the house would be helpful, so we ordered a few of the dots to have in places where we wouldn't need superb sound quality, or wanted a lower profile device. These fit the bill perfectly!",0
5,"Personal Assistant with home automation
  
",30.Jul.19,Yes,"I recently bought 2 on prime day and now wish I would have purchased 2 more. My real purpose was just something to help me keep track of my appointments and it does that OK.. I still have to tell Alexa to add an appointment or add it in my calendar myself, but it does a pretty good job of reminding me.. if I do my part. Some of the things I like, that really didn't interest me before include shopping list maker. I can tell her to add something to my shopping list and she does! So I'm cooking, run out of something- Alexa add butter to my shopping list.  Really works very well. I also like turning on and off my lights with  Alexa.  I did need to add smart plugs to do it, but it was super easy and now I can turn on or off a light with the sound of my voice or the push of a button. Word to the wise-- if your husband turns off the light at the regular switch because he won't remember alexa bedroom light off, it's not going to work for you. I did choose to set up different commands-- bedroom lamp, bedroom light, and just bedroom in hopes that it will make it less painful to remember 1 phrase. If you find something close enough to the phrase, it will still work.  I sometimes said bedroom lamp instead of bedroom light. Now either will work.  Of course you can't have 2 plugs named the same. Alexa is smart, but not a mind reader.  We also have reptiles and I can now program their lights the same way. So I can say Alexa Mortimer day and Alexa knows to switch the routine. I can automate it further to just do it at a certain time, BUT I haven't done that yet.  I also like that I can have my audio book read to me, I can set a sleep timer so it will automatically go off. There are a ton of different apps to try like daily meditation. Really Some very cool features!",0
5,"I was pretty adament about not buying one... now I am glad I did...
  
",30.Jul.19,Yes,"To be honest, I was originally against such a device in the house and not for all those conspiracy theory things. I just don't like things around me that are not tools when I am working. Still, I bought this as a package deal with something else during Amazon Prime Days. It was cheaper than the other thing alone. But I was curious, so before even setting up the other thing, I had plugged in Alexa. Reviews I had seen had me expecting generally low quality sound and issues with voice recognition. So far it has shocked me. I wouldn't use it for a party speaker, but for just background music it has a good amount of bass and a well-rounded sound. So far it has not had issues with voice commands except for things it simply cannot do.In things I do not like I can easily list one I do not think Amazon will easily be able to fix: The limitation of the ""Wake Words"" that are allowed, Alexa, Echo, Computer, or Amazon. Obviously the third word is out of the question since it is too easy to come up in conversation. The same is true for the second and fourth words, but not so frequent. That leaves Alexa. Oh well. Thankfully, it does not easily respond to television sent commands like has been joked about, so at least it won't start playing music I don't ask for just because I have the TV on.Highly enjoyable despite my reservations.",0
5,"This Gen 3 is hard of hearing... READ UPDATE AT THE END!
  
",30.Jul.19,Yes,"Was excited to get the Gen 3 Echo Dot. Had a Gen 2 and wanted better sound. The Gen 3 delivers more bass and richer sound! However, this Dot seems to be having a hard time understanding us. About half the time, she hears the wake word and I get a blue ring, but as I start talking, she goes black. I literally have to make the room quiet and stand directly in front of it for it to hear me. It is placed exactly as the Gen 2 was, but this Gen 3 seems to be hard of hearing. Disappointed...UPDATE: My bad... I had a Fire tablet located in the same room. It was picking up my commands also and was replying. The volume was turned down on it so I couldn't hear it. I turned off the hands-free Alexa option on it, now my Gen 3 is working like I expected!!!",0
3,"Can You Hear Me Now??  SMH
  
",30.Jul.19,Yes,This 3rd gen unit looks better and sounds better than the 2nd gen i upgraded from. It's a bit larger and more rounded and has a fuller sound. I really like the new look and sound. BUT.....I feel it is not as good with voice recognition as the gen 2. The gen 2 was much better at hearing and understanding me than this one. It constantly gets commands wrong and sometimes doesn't even respond to the wake word unless i speak loudly. I even exchanged the unit thinking it was defective but the replacement unit was just as poor with voice recognition. Too bad. i would have liked to have given it 5 stars. Amazon... fix or upgrade the microphone on this unit and it will be perfect.,0
5,"Alexa acted like my wife
  
",30.Jul.19,Yes,"When I first set it up, Alexa acted like my wife: she didn't listen. But after a few days I can mumble something across the room and she understands. The sound is not Bose quality but is very very good. The echo dot hooks up to my computer via wifi so it can be many rooms separated no problem. Have hooked up Pandora and Spotify and with Amazon Music I got all I need. I got it as a deal with Ring and I am more than impressed with both.Last night my echo was flashing. I asked, ""Alexa, why are you flashing?"" ""YOU HAVE A NOTIFICATION."" ""Alexa, what is my notification?"" ""A PACKAGE HAS BEEN DELIVERED."" I looked out front and there was a package by the door. YIKES!!!",0
1,"this new Dot is a joke
  
",30.Jul.19,Yes,"I have an earlier version Dot that works just fine, but this one is a real piece...  voice recognition is good, but EVERY time I pair it with my phone, it says _earching, but doesn_ connect the first time.  when I try again, it connects.  then it works fine for about 10 minutes or so before the audio cuts out.  hitting play (Spotify app) then plays through my iPhone speaker.  if I try to re-pair it, it says I_ already connected, and when I hit play again, it plays through the Dot like it_ supposed to.never had these issues with the older Dot.  unless it gets some kind of firmware/software fix, this thing is garbage.fun fact:  telling Alexa to shut up is pretty effective, which I now know thanks to how frustrating this device is.  at least they got that right.",0
3,"Didn't quite do what I thought it did.
  
",30.Jul.19,Yes,"I purchased this device specifically because I was looking to integrate some smart lights in my house (it'd be nice to turn them on from my phone in the driveway when winter hits), and from the description where it came in a bundle with the two lights it sounded like the Hue lights integrated without -another- device (the Hub). This is apparently not the case.The only real benefits now are the ability to play music through my place by having the echo in my bedroom, and the dot in the kitchen/living room area and adding stuff to my shopping list without having to yell across the place. Sound quality isn't nearly as good as the Echo itself, but decent enough for chores around the house.",0
5,"It worked first time
  
",30.Jul.19,Yes,"I had an old Alexa that I tried to set up in my husband's office last year.  It didn't work.  I returned it and received a small credit.  When I saw the Dot on special, I decided to try it.  I set it up in husband's office.  I read the instructions on how to set it up (the instructions were not too complicated!) and lo and behold it worked!  We are learning how to use the intercom feature.  It is nice to just have Alexa call the office for my husband and I to communicate rather than having to go call up the stairs or, heaven forbid, have to actually walk upstairs!",0
5,"Much improved sound over the gen 2 dot
  
",30.Jul.19,Yes,"This is my second echo dot. I have another gen 2 dot I bought a couple of years ago. I still use the older but I have moved it to the bedroom and use the newer one in the living room as my main one. The improvements in sound quality is like night and day. Having the new one, the old one sounds grainy and low quality. Functionality is more or less the same and I don't notice a difference. The only real differences is the sound quality and the improved appearance.",0
5,"Like the upgraded look, wish it was still a USB power cable.
  
",30.Jul.19,Yes,"I have the 2nd generation and I definitely like the look of this 3rd generation better. So far it's worked pretty well. Glad that it still works essentially the same as 2nd gen. just with some updated looks and buttons. Am a little disappointed that the 3rd gen doesn't go to USB to power adapter like the others, this has its own cable. Since one of the 2nd generation ones that I have, I have plugged into a USB outlet. But realistically it's no big deal. I still really like it.",0
3,"Too problematic to setup
  
",30.Jul.19,Yes,"Amazon must find a way to streamline the setup process. As it is, having to download skilled apps, linking the same to one's account is repetitive cumbersome and a downright nuisance. All the buyers info is already on your servers. Upon purchase, all the relevant software apps required to make it work, must be available out of the box; without recourse to optional licenses. This is a damper on the utility of the product, and is absolutely annoying.",0
5,"The Echo Dot is amazing
  
",30.Jul.19,Yes,"I was very, very excited to see these units work as I purchased two of them on Prime Day, and to my surprised they are amazing. The sound out of these small unit is quite loud for being the size they are and the sound quality is very good, not perfect, but for the size they do themselves justice.  I would recommend them, especially if you get the Amazon Music subscription that I got for one year with one of them.  The Voice Recognition is very good.  Every so often you need to repeat yourself, but overall is is very good.",0
5,"Echo 2 is my new Office Manager
  
",30.Jul.19,Yes,"Alexa is in my kitchen, Echo Dot 1 is in my bedroom, and now Echo Dot 2 is in my office.  They set alarms for me to get ready for a meeting, or leave for a work day.  Or tell me the weather, make my shopping list, remind me to write a check, tell me what_ on the calendar for that day, remind me to buy a birthday card, or just play my favorite music out of two speakers at once.  It_ a easy way to stay up on tasks and still have fun!",0
4,"Good device but a bit confusing
  
",30.Jul.19,Yes,"While the Echo Dot does a good job at most things, I'm not clear on how to connect devices to it.  I have gone into devices on the app and I thought I had done what needs done but it isn't completely clear on how to make this thing work with Fire TV, etc.  Sound is reasonable for a small speaker.  I have noticed that while listening to music it will sometimes stop playing for no apparent reason.",0
5,"Great way to integrate every room in the house
  
",31.Jul.19,Yes,"There was an amazing m deal during amazon days so I decided to grab a couple more for the bedrooms. All my other ones are 2nd gen. After receiving this, I am thinking about upgrading those as well. The voice recognition and sound is so much better with this model. I also like the look. I was absolutely impressed that now when you order them, it gets here fully set up and ready to go. It has been an amazing addition to my kids room since I can _rop in and talk to them if I_ in another room. These are a great for almost any room in the house and makes every thing (lights, tv, etc)  convenient and integrated.",1
1,"Don't Do It!
  
",31.Jul.19,Yes,"It was a huge mistake to even try!  My husband and I thought it would fun to step into the world of having an Alexa device in our home.  That was a huge mistake.  The worst part was when we set our smart TV up to the device.  Mind you, our TV is a very expensive 61"" TV that we have had for less than a year.  ""Alexa, turn TV on"" worked 1 time, just once.  She was not able to turn it off, and now we can no longer turn the TV on at all.  It didn't work with Alexa, not with the handheld controller, and not even with the power switch on the TV.  We now have to turn the power on by unplugging the TV and letting it power back up.  Each time we do that, we have to go though to configuration cycle.  We have disabled the Alexa app for the TV, but that didn't work.  I am frustrated and pi$$ed off!",0
5,"It's making a big difference
  
",31.Jul.19,Yes,"Not to overstate, but, I'm not sure how I was able do without the Dot. I'm a writer, and, I'm always looking things up.In many cases it's pretty easy.I found out today that if you spell a word you're unsure of, Dot will give me the pronunciation.I love how I can play any song or any artist from My Music.  and, you can ask for the name of the song. Of course, to take full advantage of music features it's good to have the Prime music subscription.I can play music libraries such as smooth jazz or rock.Or any radio station, anywhere.Lastly, I use the timer and the weather functions all the time. I run, so knowing the temperature and coming weather is important.Get an Echo. You'll love it. And, wonder how you did without it.",0
2,"Was hoping for better
  
",31.Jul.19,Yes,"When I heard that the sound was much improved I ordered one! I have it in my kitchen and like to listen to music while cooking, eating, etc. and did not want/need to spring for a Bluetooth speaker. At first I was impressed as the sound really was improved. Then I was disappointed to find out that after a few hours of listening the sound degraded horribly. It sounded just like listening to your car radio as you drive too far from the radio station... terrible. I also found that when this happens Alexa no longer responds to your command to stop the static noise emanating from ""her"" without standing right next to it and yelling at it. I also tried playing music on my older version, the same music at the same time as the new one is going nuts with no issue. After a couple times of this I contacted Alexa help. They were very helpful and attentive, I described my problem, tried a couple things they suggested to no avail so, no problem, they sent me a replacement a refurbished gen 3??? What?! The dang thing just came out how are there refurbs already??? Not. Happy. After I set it up, things were all well and fine for several months when the issue returned! I contacted the help again and all they can tell me to do it to reset the device to factory setting to ""see if that resolves the issue"" it_ the same problem I had the first time, with the NEW unit, where this did not work then. Outside of this issue, the device works as expected but had I known, I would not have went for the upgrade and bought a Bluetooth speaker (which I ended up doing anyway). Would not recommended it if, like me, you were looking for a sound upgrade.",0
5,"Wonderful!
  
",31.Jul.19,Yes,"These 3rd gen Echo dots are wonderful. These little speakers put out surprisngly big, loud and excellent sound quality. Voice recognition and responsiveness are highly  accurate. Amazon had a 2 pack deal on these and I jumped on it. It was like getting one for free! I paired the two of them as a stereo set and added an Echo Sub. The combination fills my living room, dining room and kitchen with high quality, clear, rich sound. Great for listening to music! Make sure you space out everything correctly. Pairing and set up was super easy. Set up the stereo pair first, then add the Echo Subwoofer for the deep bass low sounds. You will be very pleased.",0
5,"This Echo is the 4th we'vepurchased for use in our home ... We lovehem all!
  
",31.Jul.19,Yes,"I cannot find fault with anything ... A nice small size that tucks away nicely yet it picks up my voice constantly from about up to 25 feet away, the sound is clear and amazingly robust for such a small item.  And once you research/Google what else this Echo dot/Alexia can do, you will find it is not only fun, but really handy to find the estimated time to your office or returning home that wok day, top news items from any of my favorite sources, add to my shopping or to-do lists,\ ... kind of wonder how I did without it.  My kids bought my wife one for her Bd to try and we liked it so much we got these 3 more dots o put in other rooms of our house for convenience.  Love this item!",0
5,"An incredible upgrade from 2nd Gen version!
  
",31.Jul.19,Yes,"Toss your old 1st and 2nd Gen Echo Dots and get the new the 3rd Gen. The latest 3rd Gen version is waaay better! The 3rd Gen Echo Dot  is like a 2019 Ferrari compared to the 2nd Gen Echo Dot which is a like a 1989 Pontiac Fiero.My quadriplegic nephew uses the 2nd Gen Echo Dot to control TV, listen to music, etc and it has been a God send. However, he needed to repeat his commands almost half the time with the 2nd Gen Dot. The new 3rd Gen Echo Dot hears his commands the 1st time about 90% of times. The sound quality on the new version is also way better. The new version has more bass, treble, higher volume and is just a way better device all around to the point where we were upset we didn't upgrade a lot sooner.",0
4,"Dot and Show do not integrate well with Sonos
  
",31.Jul.19,Yes,"This is for both the Echo Dot and Echo Show.  I was given for a birthday, a dot, a show and several sonos speakers, two Ones and two Play 1's . By adding Sonos to the Alexa App, the Play 1's can be controlled, but the Ones with built in Alexa are troublesome.  We have a family member with that name, so we wanted to change everything to ""Echo"" or ""Computer"" and the Sonos cannot be changed.  The Alexa on the Sonos also has trouble recognizing the other Echo items.  Not a good integration, and since it is the Alexa that is the basis, we assume Amazon and Sonos are in dispute, and we pay the price since the name change and integration seems to work fine, if the Sonos One is not the closest speaker to the voice issuing the commends.",0
5,"Rocket Science Not Needed! Simple to use.
  
",31.Jul.19,Yes,"I bought this for my wife, she does not really embrace technology. Set it up in our bedroom for her to really use as an alarm. I showed her once and boom, she took off with it and she told me it was not rocket science to use. Exactly what I was looking for her. She loves it and embraces the technology. Good look too, I use the basic black 1st gen, still works great. I will buy a new one to upgrade in the near future. Very satisfied with both our echos.",1
5,"Unexpectedly much better than Echo dot 2nd generation
  
",31.Jul.19,Yes,"I added it to a little ""chain"" composed of 1 Echo and 2 Echo dots 2nd generation; moved the old echo dot from my bedroom to another room and replaced it with the new one. What a difference! A cuter design, immediately connected to the network, very responsive to the voice even with background noise (such as radio on), and especially better sound: richer, clearer, more bass. Almost (but not quite...) like an Echo. Maybe I should have bought more....",0
5,"Easy to set up
  
",31.Jul.19,Yes,Works great and does everything I need it to do and more!I don't have a house phone so if I am the only one here and lay my phone down I can easily find it using the dog simply by asking Alexa to find my phone.Turn lights on and off by voice command.Get the news and weather. Set alarms and reminders and p!at music.,1
3,"Does a lot for a little Dot
  
",31.Jul.19,Yes,"This is my second Echo Dot. Extremely easy to set up. I like the looks of the 3rd gen. My other dot is 2nd gen.  I went on line to see what it can do and there are  numerous ""skills"" that you  can chose . Which leads me to my only complaint. There may be an answer and I don't know. So what frustrates me is in ""my skill"" I have to scroll through to find them. I would like an easier and faster format. Like alphabetical that I can click on or similar to my phone list.  It has a lot of cool things it can do, but  if it takes too long to find them or I forget what I have then I won't use them and  Dot  does very little but answers an occasional question.",0
2,"Fun but not as impressed as some
  
",31.Jul.19,Yes,We don't hate it. I wasn't as happy with getting these as my husband was. We use them for verious things around the house. Several voice commands the manual says to use seem to confuse Alexa. We have quite a few bugs to work out. Supposed to connect to our Roku TV doesnt. We are supper upset but a little annoyed because again it should. I wouldn't ever want to pay full price for these,0
5,"A Big Improvement
  
",31.Jul.19,Yes,"The 3rd Generation Echo Dot is a vast improvement over previous iterations. The sound quality has really improved, the fabrics used on the Dot are nice and the button feel is solid and confident.  While the sound quality of the small Dot is not going to impress any audiophile, I use 5 Echo Dots in a group for music throughout the house.  I also have an Echo Dot connected to my stereo system for more critical listening.",0
4,"Works as expected, can't connect to BT speakers
  
",1.Aug.19,Yes,"So, knowing full well that Amazon listens to and records everything said in earshot of these things and keeps said records forever and lets humans listen to the recordings, I bought one of these to put in my wood shop. All it will ever hear is me 'singing' along to music and the sound of lots of saws running. Hooked up to my 70's Pioneer receiver and a pair of speakers from the same era that are big enough to be night stands. It's nice to be able to just yell at the thing to play music, adjust volume, and tell it that I hate or love this song, and it does it without me having to stop what I'm doing to do so. It's honestly kind of amazing how well it can hear me given how loud I am usually blaring music, and it's sitting right on top of the receiver, which is sitting right on top of the speakers.That said, I am disappointed that it doesn't seem to be able to actually pair with other bluetooth devices to play music through. The pamplet it came with seemed to indicate that it could, and the Alexa app (that needs more permissions than you have to give and wants every antenna your phone has enabled to install) also seems to indicate it should be possible, but after querying Alexa, the app, and google, I haven't been able to figure out how to pair my Dot with a pair of BT headphones. I have a pair of worktunes headphones that are hearing protection with BT headphones built into them that I would love to be able to play music from the Dot into, but oh well. Can just use my phone like I had been anyway.",0
5,"Great Little Gadget
  
",1.Aug.19,Yes,"Super happy with this product, and we'll probably buy at least one more for another location in our home. Its primary uses (for us) include: acting as a ""phone"" so my children can reach me or my husband when we are not at home; acting as an intercom when I'm in one location of the house and need to reach the area where our Alexa is kept without shouting across the house (thanks, Alexa, for enabling my laziness!); playing music. I love that I can add as many voices as we have Alexa apps. Meaning, we've trained Alexa to recognize my voice and my husband's since we both have the app on our phones. Our children, however, do not have devices of any kind, and we can't teach her their voices without them having devices with the Alexa app.",0
2,"Functions come; functions go
  
",1.Aug.19,Yes,"Decent little speaker(s). I use one in the bedroom for audiobooks; compatibility with Audible.com is a major advantage. I use two in the kitchen for stereo. Reliable, easy to connect, easy to program. The problem is that the reason why you bought the dot yesterday may not be available tomorrow. Functions seem to come and go at random. Programmers are able to drop functions with no notice or explanation so you are now the ""happy"" owner of a device that performs half of what you expected when you bought it. I complained once before and the function returned w/o notice. Five weeks later the function has again disappeared w/o notice. Will any of the functions be reliably available in the future? Buyer beware.",0
4,"generally a pleasure to use
  
",1.Aug.19,Yes,"surprisingly good voice recognition; our grandson demo'd the ""are you smarter than a fifth grader"" feature of the ""dot"", which worked very nicely and was fun.  Haven't used it to integrate Alexa controlled devices like lightbulbs for instance, so cannot comment on that feature.  Sound is very warm, almost too bassy, but is overall pretty easily understood.  Volume of sound is surpisingly strong from such a small device.  It has some ""heft"" to it, being much heavier than one would suspect from just looking at it.  Overall, we like it and it was priced nicely on the Amazon shopping day recently offered.",0
4,"Easy setup, delivers as advertised, versatile smart device
  
",1.Aug.19,Yes,"This is my first echo dot. It delivers as advertised. Setup was easy. Voice recognition is very good. It would have been great if it supported music from Youtube but I guess you can do that with your phone while using it as a bluetooth speaker. Yet to test the full range of services but as far as asking questions, telling jokes and playing music, I am satisfied thus far. I like the ability to control other smart devices and aspects of a smart home. Definitely a useful buy, very versatile device. Also, it does not take up much room and speaker volume is loud enough for a standard room.",0
5,"Personal assistant
  
",1.Aug.19,Yes,I like being able to ask Alexa for various answers from the comfort of my recliner.  She times my walking and lets me know when to stop.  I encountered one problem.  She was flashing green.  I asked her why and she responded that she did not know.  I asked her what it meant if she was flashing green.  She did not know.  I asked her stop and she did not stop.  Someone told me that it meant that there is a notification.  I asked her to read it to me and then she stopped flashing.  It would be nice to have a booklet to refer to to find out what different colors or flashes mean.,0
5,"Great little helpful tool
  
",1.Aug.19,Yes,"I've had a first-gen Echo/Alexa for a few years now.  Adding in this 3rd gen Echo Dot was great.  Very useful, and more convenient than having to go to the other end of my house if I needed to use my original Alexa for something.  Love the small form factor.  I thought audio quality might suffer due to the size, but teh audio seems as good as the origianl - at least for what I use it for (I don't stream much music through Alexa - usually just kid's music when the grandkids are visiting, and my usage of Alexa primarily just requires voice output for answers or command confirmations).",0
1,"Buy the 2nd generation. Piece of junk!!
  
",1.Aug.19,Yes,"Alexa is less responsive than the 2nd generation. I have to repeat myself several times to get a proper answer. Piece of junk. Keeps making odd noises and won't connect to my smart plugs. While trying to exchange it, Amazon says that they will call, but it doesn't allow me to put my phone number on the form properly. So what good is that process?? I've been trying since July to get it to work for me to no avail. It's defective.",0
4,"It's helpful in the kitchen!
  
",1.Aug.19,Yes,"We got a free Alexa as a promotion for our satellite radio.  I thought it was going to be stupid... but for free I would take it.  Actually,  I am amazed at how fast it answers my questions!!  When cooking, I yell out questions and get the answer right away. ""Alexa, how many carbs in a strawberry?"". "" Alexa, how long do I pan fray a scallop?"",  ""Alexa, how many carbs in an olive"".  Alexa has certainly simplified going KETO!",0
5,"Great product for anyone really!
  
",1.Aug.19,Yes,"I never thought I would use one of these Echo devices, but now have 4 in my home! They are so incredibly convenient with regards to getting weather info, listening to music, and a plethora of other things that can be automated. What really takes Alexa to the next level is when you start integrating smart lights or smart outlets in your home and gaining the ability to turn lights on and off with either your voice or through your phone! Great thing for people who hate getting out of bed to turn the lights of at night haha!",0
5,"Great product, recommend everyone have one (or two).
  
",2.Aug.19,Yes,"Overall this is a great product. It works wonderfully for the purposes I need.I love music so it suits me well to have a song pop into my head and be able to have alexa play it.It is great for me as I am a heavy aleeper so the alarm and morning routine works amazingly.I purchased two and put one in my children's room. It allows us to communicate without having to go back and forth across the house.The announcements feature is amazing because it broadcasts announcements over all connected devices.I have freetime enabled on my children's so they can request kid friendly music, set up routines, play games and even request bedtime stories.We love it and will buy more to put throughout the rest of our home. We are also looking into getting more connected devices that are Alexa compatible.Downfalls: sometimes when thr volume is high while plating music or reading a story, the echo dot has difficulty recognizing or even registering commands. Another thing is that the dot does SOOOO MUCH and I have no idea what it is fully capable of so I feel like I am not using it to its full potential. I wish thete were were more documentation in the box or a complete list of commands and capabilities.",0
5,"Love this powerful little guy!
  
",2.Aug.19,Yes,Sound quality is really great for a speaker of this size! Totally worth the little extra money for this one over the 2nd generation. I don't think it understands you as good as the Echo however it still does a fantastic job taking commands. We actually got this as a promo deal packaged with something and I didn't think I would have much use for it as we already have an echo in our main living areas. However I put it in our master bedroom and I love it! I now want one for each of my kiddos rooms. Some nights it reads us a bedtime story and I love having the music at my command in my room as well. We have had many bedtime dance parties with our kiddos since putting this up stairs. Woud highly recommend.,0
5,"A SURPRISING EVENT FOR ME
  
",2.Aug.19,Yes,"For some time I was reluctant to have one of Amazon's voice activated devices, mostly because one had to pay almost $25 for a device for the Amazon device to do its job to turn on a light or etc.  When I saw the low price offered by Amazon during the two day Amazon Prime days this year for the Echo Dot device and I found a good price for two circuit control devices, I decided to make the leap.  WOW!!  I am pleasantly surprised and pleased to have the Echo Dot.  I primarily wanted it to play the great SLEEP SOUNDS (Ocean waves) at night, but to be able to turn two lights on or off by voice is better than guessed, Plus I am still learning all the marvelous things ALEXA can do to help or entertain me.  THANKS AMAZON!!!",0
5,"I love this thing!
  
",2.Aug.19,Yes,"So I did get this and two Phillips Hue bulbs for a very low price on Prime Day, so i thought i would give it a shot. I currently have the Dot and both of the bulbs in my bedroom. I will admit it gets some getting used to. I keep turning on my lamps with the switch instead of with the Dot. But with the app i dont have to get up to turn anything on or off. As for Alexa, i dont think i have explored all of the options yet, but i mainly use it to control the lights and to listen to music while folding cloths, it is also handy for the weather for the day. Overall i think it was worth it and i cant wait to see what else it is capable of.",0
5,"Very useful! No regurts!
  
",2.Aug.19,Yes,"If you_e new to these devices and concerned about Alexa_ ability to understand what you_e saying (as I was), don_ be. Alexa_ speech recognition is better and faster than Siri/iPhone. Our family loves these already. Purchased two on a Prime Day deal and immediately wished I had purchased two more. Alexa has great hearing but she has her limits and you will get tired of yelling into the next room. Great sound quality for comparable small speakers. I do not advise buying this primarily for playing music unless you haven_ yet been spoiled by high quality home stereo system. Best use for Alexa, in my opinion, is for controlling lights and announcing in my kids room for him to go to sleep.",0
1,"Multitude of problems - Zigbee hub does not work over Bluetooth
  
",2.Aug.19,Yes,"This is my first ever Echo device and I only had it for a week now. I've always been a google home assistant person but gave this a try for Prime day, with the Philips Hue Bluetooth Color Bulbs combo. The voice recognition works well just as you'd expect from an Echo device.First of all, I had a really bad experience with the on-time delivery of this device. They cancelled my order without my consent and then tried denying me a new device. I had to call them 4 times because every time I got assertive, my call got disconnected magically. Worst customer service experience for me in probably a decade and I cannot believe how low Amazon_ customer service standards have fallen.And then the actual device_ problems. The whole - works with Philips bulbs over Bluetooth- thing, is either a scam or they just released it without testing it properly because of course, prime day sales. The device does not recognize the bulbs. Cannot connect to them. This problem persists with most people who bought the combo that amazon disabled reviews for the bulbs. I have spent north of 4 hours, tinkering with it myself and talking to customer service trying to figure out why. Both customer reps I talked to tried blaming it on my phone, that there is somehow something wrong with my Pixel 2, or the bulbs which is really low for Amazon. Only when I asked them to send that in writing in an email, they backed down from trying to blame it on my end. This is all incredibly shady.They finally figured out that my firmware is not up to date but the device cannot update its firmware. It just does not update it and yes I have tried the whole mute overnight thing and it still will not update. Apparently there is no real way to force it to update. I cannot remember the last time a device gave me so many problems.My advice, to those who are able to read this before this review mysteriously disappears from Amazon, is do not buy it until the general consensus that they fixed most problems. I hate that over the years I became so dependent on Amazon that I cannot really do anything about any of this, but write a bad review. I miss the company that put customer service on top of Jeff Bezos wallet.",0
5,"They can be very helpful with tasks around the house.
  
",2.Aug.19,Yes,"I have these all over the house. I love the ability to play music everywhere. It also tells me when there is motion detected at the front door. I use it to turn lights on and off also. When someone leaves the house or television on and I am in bed I can just ask the Echo to turn everything off. This will come in handy this winter. I haven_ yet used it to re-order products we use often but, I am sure I will soon. The speaker quality is really nice. Much improved over the earlier models.",0
4,"Worth the upgrade!
  
",2.Aug.19,Yes,"Upgraded from a 2nd Gen Dot (Thanks to a great Prime Day trade-in sale). Sound is much louder and more rich in this speaker. The only downside is that it no longer uses micro-USB for power (Google mini still achieves similar performance over USB power). The plug is large and must be installed inverted to avoid blocked the other outlet. Previously, I had USB outlets that allowed me to have two USB devices and two normal 110v plugs.",0
5,"WOW! Sound Quality Blows Away 2nd Generation!
  
",2.Aug.19,Yes,The 3rd generation dot is all we_e come to expect in this product but with much better _istening due to the extra mics and the audio playback quality is like night vs day vs the 2nd generation dot.Very happy with my purchase and would recommend the Echo Dot to anyone! I_e had my original 2nd generation dot for months and am still learning what all it is capable of.,0
4,"Objective - Louder Dot - Check - However ...
  
",3.Aug.19,Yes,"We decided to upgrade the Echo Dot in our bathroom because I could not hear it well enough, even at full volume, to listen to books or news while showering.The new dot delivers much fuller sound and higher volumes from its little built-in speakers.  Mission Accomplished!  I can now listen to Kindle and Audible books or News Briefings (with variable volumes from one news source to another), even when in the shower.The reason for four instead of five stars is because of two things that could be better:1) The bass is too high, and I do not know how to adjust it.  The lower frequencies overpower the upper and mid-tones. The dominant bass makes listening to books and news a little less pleasant, more difficult.2) When using it to control lighting in the adjacent room, it does not understand us very well in spite of the wide opening between the rooms and no background noise.  To be fair, it could be a quirky acoustic issue with these rooms.  It's usable, but we have to work at getting it to understand us a bit more than we do with our other echo devices.",0
3,"Not wireless!
  
",3.Aug.19,Yes,"Alexa is the coolest AI around. You can ask or do just about anything. My only complaints are volume &amp; portability. Possibly the absolute worst feature of the echo is having to have it plugged in to work. The echo does not have a battery in its design so it doesn_ hold a charge. So it has to stay plugged into the wall to work. I despise that &amp; honestly would not have purchased if I knew that beforehand. This should be wireless! Even the similar forms of Bluetooth speakers are wireless &amp; hold a charge. Come on echo!Also, it doesn_ get very loud when playing music. I have a small bathroom &amp; like to listen when I_ showering. My Old Jam3 speaker plays music almost twice as loud as The echo on both of their max volumes. Like, if I speak at a normal volume I can hear myself over the echo. Not the case with the Jam3 speaker.",1
3,"More of a Toy
  
",3.Aug.19,Yes,"I purchased 3 echo dots with the intention of being able to talk between rooms and maybe a little home automation.  There are  a couple of methods of talking between echo devices, ""calling"" and ""drop in"".  Calling requires someone at the other echo to answer the call; drop in does not required any action and is good for eaves-dropping on conversations.  The sound is unintelligible; I wind up shouting down the stairs.  So I cannot use it to communicate, but surely I can use it for home automation.  So I bought two plugs and hooked up two lights.  Sounds great.  But turn on the light always gets me the same response - which light do you mean.  Perhaps I want to turn on the light in the room where I am standing.  You can give the lights two different names, but the names have to fit something alexa can reliably understand like ""light one"" and ""light two"".  Which one is ""light one"" again?  Ok.  Still not a problem, I am an expert programmer I can just write some code and get alexa to do what I want.  Well, not really.  The tools are very limited.  The Alexa programmers have a very narrow view of what Alexa should do and you can't really step outside that very tiny box.  Well they do play music and it sounds better than AM radio so I gave it 3 stars.(update) Someone asked what code I was trying to write.  First I tried to create a 2 echo microphone array to improve the sound quality, but the data I need is not accessible.  The second thing I tried was to use data from my phone to improve home automation, I can get temperature, altitude and location from my phone which then can be used to turn on an air conditioner for example.  Nope, can't do that either.  The last thing I tried was to have two alexas carry on a conversation - this could fool would be thieves into thinking there were people in the house.  Oh, well.  My wife put things into perspective, ""What did you expect, Alexa is just a child after all"".",0
5,"A lucky Prime Day purchase
  
",3.Aug.19,Yes,"Took advantage of Prime Day and got my new best friend here for $22 bucks! Just having something around I can get the time, weather, sports, and games made it well worth the money. The gag is  I bought it because my bathroom speakers died the day before. I was simply replacing them and now I'm about to purchase the full Echo for the bedroom! I'm hooked.",1
3,"Not yet ready for primetime
  
",3.Aug.19,Yes,I own two of these products and see them as it best adequate. They are very annoying in that they require you to repeat commands that you have used many times before over and over as they misjudge what you have said. The best feature is the ability 2 control lights and air conditioning by voice command. I subscribe to podcast and streaming Music Services and the speakers are excellent. However I cannot use the demand features of these services only live streams. The integration by  Bluetooth with my phone is especially wonky. it often requires me to reboot my phone in order to connect. There is no easy way to understand the features of these devices so it is a hit-or-miss process setting things to work with them and requires ridiculous amounts of time and effort. Overall if you do not have a pressing need for these devices as I do you may want to wait another generation or two until they are ready for primetime.,0
2,"Bad Quality
  
",3.Aug.19,Yes,"We have a few Echos and an Echo show that are performing well. This one we've only used for a few months after returning from vacation before the speaker ""blew"". The sound is horribly garbled as if the speaker is defective. Worked with Amazon customer service hoping to get a replacement but after going through the rickets of deleting and re-adding it to our Alexa app was denied a replacement but was offered a discount on a new Echo.",0
4,"Echo dot
  
",3.Aug.19,Yes,"A handy little gadget that provides responses to voice commands, such as specific types of music, alarms, weather, time and other information upon request.  Basic setup needed to get started is easy, but other things are not nearly as intuitive.  For example, if I request music by a specific artist it will search the Amazon music library (up to 2 million songs are free and an advanced library with up to 10 million songs are by subscription) is easy.  However, I haven't figured out how to set up Pandora to play on it.It also connects with Bluetooth devices easily.  For example, I connect it to my Beats Pill (a wireless speaker) so that I can have music on my patio.It has privacy settings that are supposed to maintain your privacy (so no one, including Amazon, can hack in and listen to what is going on in your house.  The fact that it can be accessed by a third party in the first place makes me skeptical about any privacy settings.  So if you've got nothing to hide, privacy shouldn't be too much of a concern.",0

4,"Good speaker for listening to music and accessing all of Alexa's features
  
",4.Aug.19,Yes,"This is the second 3rd Gen Echo Dot I have owned.  I purchased this as part of a package deal when I ordered two Sengled bulbs (color).  It was basically a situation of getting just the Sengled bulbs, or getting the bulbs and the echo for a few bucks (less than ten but I don't remember exactly), so it was a no brainer for me.This little speaker has a much better sound than it's predecessor.  It has deeper and richer tones.  It hits more highs and does better with the lows, but is by no means a replacement for a sub if you're looking for deep bass.  The dot does everything as advertised.  I often use it for checking on the weather and travel before I head out.  I take a train into work and it saves me the effort of whipping out my phone and checking an app.  I have also used this speaker to check on order statuses, which is quite helpful if I don't have ready access to a laptop.I also, of course, use these devices to power on other electronics like my Sengled bulbs, the X-Box Ones (Day One Edition and Scorpio), my smart tv (LG OLED B65).  The latter requires communication via an app on my smart phone, but it makes getting the lights and TV on the right channel easy before I get downstairs in the morning.  It might sound like laziness, but when your rushing to get out the door to work in the morning, it is helpful and has a certain cool factor that I like.  I also really like the drop in and broadcast features.  If you ever wanted a comm system for your house, this makes it easy to communicate across floors.  With our finished basement, we have 4 floors people could be on.  Rather than shouting up and down the stairwells, this is a much more civilized alternative.I can't say these are better than other wireless speakers, say from Google or another manufacturer, as I don't have any of those.  I check comparisons on YouTube, and they stack up well to competitors.  It all really comes down to your preferences and what ""buy in"" you have with amazon.  For example, if you have a prime account, Amazon Music, etc., getting an Echo makes sense.Long story short, I recommend this speaker.  It's better than the 2nd gen, and it has a ton of features I don't even use that would be fun or useful to some.  I now have 4 dots in my home, two 2nd Generation kid editions, one 3rd Gen in the living room, and one in the bedroom.  I also have a larger 2nd Gen Echo in the kitchen.  I might consider buying another for our kids playroom in the basement.  At that point I would have at least one on every floor in our house.I would have given this device 5 stars, but there is room for improvement in the sound department.  Also, echo can get confused and mistake words at times.  It's a minor gripe though.  It might be my voice, my not speaking clearly enough, or background noise (mostly from my kids) which causes this.",0
2,"Sounds is louder but muffled, not as clear as Gen 2 Echo Dot's.
  
",4.Aug.19,Yes,"I have 3 (2nd Gen) Echo Dot's and I just purchased this Gen 3 Echo Dot (Amazon stopped selling the Gen 2's), it's not that I'm used to the way the Gen 2 sounds, there's clearly a difference between the Gen 2 and Gen3 in voice sound clarity, to be honest the Gen 2 sounds much better, clearer, in the way Alexa's voice sounds in response to questions, to me the Gen 3 sounds muffled, like talking with your hand over your mouth loudly!  I tried adjusting the ""Audio Controls"",  Bass, Midrange and Treble within the Alexa app but it doesn't really help.  The Gen 2 just outperforms the Gen 3 in voice clarity, period!When listening to music however the Gen 3 outperforms the Gen 2 in music/sound quality but how often do you listen to music through the built in speaker? I use an external bluetooth speaker set for that.  If your purchasing the Gen 3 to play music then you'll be really happy with it, if not, stick with the Gen 2, if you can still find them...",0
5,"Go ahead and buy, you won't regret it.
  
",4.Aug.19,Yes,"Love my Echo dots! We have three throughout the house.  One starts off my day by waking me every morning with a new greeting, the news, and some tunes and they all keep me on track throughout my day. My favorite feature so far is the shopping list. If you only knew the number of times I would think of something we needed when I was in the kitchen or upstairs etc... and when I was at the store I couldn't, for the life of me, remember what it was we needed. Now I just have Echo add it to my shopping list and when I'm at the store I just look at my phone. I wish it worked with Netflix and some other apps on my smart TVs,  and not just the Roku app, but that is probably a licensing issue. I'm definitely going to be getting a couple more along with some of the other peripheral devices.",0
4,"Super util!!!!
  
",4.Aug.19,Yes,"Lo compré en un día de rebajas. Si llego a saber lo contento que estaría con él, hubiese comprado otro para la habitación.La calidad de audio con música es bastante decente para el tamaño que tiene.También puede ser utilizado como el típico altavoz bluetooth.Creo que con el tiempo este tipo de dispositivos se harán super populares en todos los hogares.",1
5,"Fantastic
  
",4.Aug.19,Yes,"This past year experienced echo and echo dot for the first time. Now we have one echo and three echo dots in our home. We have only used them for very simple things like playing music, dropping in on each other and some other more simple apps. Can only imagine how awesome this will be once we start utilizing them for a hands free home. Very simple interface and simple to get started. Very reasonably priced for all the possible uses.",0
5,"Much better volume than previous model
  
",4.Aug.19,Yes,"Wow! I_ pleasantly surprised how much better the sound quality is with this compared to the previous model. So much louder.It does have more sensitive _earing so sometimes it creeps me out when it goes off on its own. That_ why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Keep in mind if you have a TV or anything noisy nearby, it may activate the unit. Once it asked me if I was whispering. Creeepy!!",0
5,"Incredible Device
  
",4.Aug.19,Yes,"With my Amazon Prime, I have a lot of music at my disposal.  I'm considering upgrading to unlimited music.  I also bought a cable that converts from 3.5mm to RCA.  The jack on the back of the Dot is VERY handy.  I used the cable to plug the Dot into my home theater receiver.  This allows me to have Alexa play whatever song I request and have it come out of my bigger speakers.  Without this ability, I probably would have gone with the larger Echo.  It would sound less anemic due to the larger speaker.  Both units have Alexa capabilities (playing music, controlling smart devices such as thermostats, telling jokes, playing sound effects...).",0
1,"Easy to install
  
",5.Aug.19,Yes,"This is my 5th Echo dot.  I had problems installing some of the other ones (internet not showing up, screen clearing when I went to enter the code, etc.), but this one was a breeze.  Also, the sound quality on this little device is almost as good as my more expensive non-dot tall device that I first bought.  And it's thicker and more sturdy.I have two devices on every floor.  I don't even turn my head to look at the clock anymore; I just ask Alexa.  I only wish I had one in my car.  Alexa reminds me things about 6 or 7 times a day.My only complaint _ Amazon used to allow you to hear your voice reminder.  Now it's just text, and Amazon often scrambles the text so I don't know what it was that I was requesting.  I hate this.  I wish to God they didn't take that huge advantage away.UPDATE (Nov 22 2019):  I had a 5-star rating, but it dropped to one-star when I got an email saying an ECHO DOT was $22.  I clicked to order, then it said it was $34.  My respect for amazon has dropped tremendously with this deception.",0
5,"Coming from a 2nd gen, this is a nice upgrade
  
",5.Aug.19,Yes,"I have two 2nd gen dots in my house and bought this during Prime day. The voice recognition seems improved as it can hear me from farther away than before and the speaker quality is night and day. I put this in my living room where my kids like to tell Alexa to play different songs and previously with the 2nd gen vs now with the 3rd gen, the quality it emits is much better. I use Alexa for a lot of things--random questions that would be easier to ask her than to look it up on my phone which always gets me a good answer, to control the various wifi lights I use, to set timers for when I'm cooking, to ask what the weather is/will be like, and lastly to play music. These are extremely helpful to have and depending on how large your house is, you should have at least 3 of them strategically placed in your house for easy voice access whenever you need to ask her something.",0
4,"Giving It Another Try _
  
",5.Aug.19,Yes,"We received a free g00gle home mini with our Spotify Family plan. Before filling our house with them, we wanted to compare with Alexa. Unfortunately, Alexa app is very slow to load, sometimes not loading at all. She doesn't work well with Spotify or with Amazon Music. She consistently gets our local weather wrong (temp right now is 65° but she says 86°). She plays the wrong radio stations from Tunein &amp; iheartradio even when we state call letters and frequency. Speaker is pretty good, works well with Amazon Smart Plug. Calls to phones are shown as ""unknown"". Will be returning her since she doesn't seem to work well in our area yet.Update: returned, but then repurchased since  Amazon Smart Plug worked so well with it. Got frustrated trying to get 3rd party smart plugs apps to link with Google Home.",0
4,"Its great at turning on and off the lights and playing music-- other than that -- we may never know!
  
",5.Aug.19,Yes,"So I like my dots-- I have 3 now-- I use them sparingly because the interface and such are not as user friendly as they keep telling me they are.  Half the things I ask Alexa I am told that she doesn't know -- and since there is not an easy way to find info on the alexa app, I don't know either.  I finally figured out how to get music to sync over all the devices and I can play music throughout the house now.  I can control my Hue Lights with it-- but if you don't ask specifically --it won't do what I need it to do-- basically I use the alexa to turn them on and off. Any changes in the light I do through the Hue app-- since every time I ask Alexa to do something like change the color or make it brighter-- it tells me that it doesn't know how to do that.  So I stopped trying so hard.  I would love to do more with my echo dots-- but since every time I ask it to do something--it tells me it can't-- It has become a glorified stereo and light turner onner.  It would be nice if you didn't have to change your way of talking so that the alexa can figure out what you want to do.  but until I have time -- and I mean several hours to sit down -- and a manual that explains things instead of a non user friendly app that is so confusing it makes my head hurt-- I will use it to play music and turn the lights on and off.  Oh -- one night I wanted to listen to one of my audible books.  I wanted and needed to start the book over since I had started listening to it and lost track -- I could not get alexa to start over-- I said it umpteen different times and it continually said -- I don't know and then played from where it had stopped before.  I finally got fed up and turned it off.  I feel like I am wasting the potential of this technology and worry that all I am really doing is making it easier for people to spy on me.",0
4,"Alexa first impressions
  
",5.Aug.19,Yes,"This was my 1st step into this sort of device. While I'm still learning all there is to know about it, I've got some thoughts. 1. This is a fun device for starting your home automation journey. It seems to work pretty well and has been good at figuring out what we say to it. Seldom does it falter on a command. The one issue I have is the sound quality is marginal. It's pretty much all mid-range with no highs or lows. And no obvious way to adjust the tone. I tried to use it as a desk speaker but it just won't cut it.  Also, I don't know where it gets it's weather forecast from, but it's frequently at odds with the local forecast as well as Wunderground.",0
5,"The Echo Dot has completely changed my life!
  
",5.Aug.19,Yes,"I bought my first Echo Dot during Amazon Prime Days. On the encouragement from my brother, I also bought the Echo Show 5. I am beyond happy with my purchases! With a few simple voice commands - I can find a new recipe, the weather forecast, the latest news, my favorite songs on Pandora, set the a/c to on, and even turn off the lights in my living room (I added power outlets too). I also geeked out on the fact that I could send an announcement to my son's bedroom letting him know that breakfast was ready. I honestly can't believe I waited this long to make these purchases!",0
4,"surprisngly good voice recognition, but doesn't work flawlessly with the existing alexa
  
",5.Aug.19,Yes,"Sometimes when I get tired, I mumble heavily. Even then, it catches my command pretty well.The downside is that it doesn't work flawlessly with my existing alexa. I have one in the kitchen and one in the living room. I let somehting get cooked, and then sit around in the living room. I'll sat a timer in kitchen, but that timer doesn't get transferred over to the living room. Like, when I ask the living room how much time is left on the timber, it doesn't recognize the timer. That's kind of annoying.",0
5,"Great sound!
  
",5.Aug.19,Yes,"Wow is she fun! Great sound quality, fills the house.  My husband is having a blast with her, he asks her to do funny things like cluck like a chicken or bark like a dog. He also says good morning to her and she gives him the trivia of the day. Today was national underwear day! She came with a plug during Amazon Prime Days, we have our night lamp plugged into it and Alexa turns the lamp on and off for us. She is just way to much fun and has an extensive selection of music. We also have Sirius which she recognises.",0
5,"Awesome product
  
",5.Aug.19,Yes,"I already have the other colors offered for this generation echo dot but always avoided the white one because it just didn_ seem like a good idea because it would get dirty too quick. I decided to buy one in white and I really like how it looks, very clean and I have it in my room so it doesn_ get dirty. I probably wouldn_ buy this color for a kitchen or somewhere near kids because the white color would get dirty so much faster than the charcoal or grey colored dots.",0
5,"Great Sound
  
",5.Aug.19,Yes,I purchased this for the simple reason that I could pair it with a Bluetooth speaker which you can't do with the larger Echo. I was hesitant to purchase just because I assumed the sound wouldn't be very good. Boy was I wrong. The sound is great considering the size of the Dot. It was so easy to install since I already have an Echo. So glad I made the purchase - price was great too as I purchased it during Prime Days.,0
5,"It is compact and cute
  
",5.Aug.19,Yes,"It was harder to set up than I thought. But, thanks to you tube videos, I_e set it up. It is clear sounding. I_ going to love using it for my Audible books. And my music that_ on my prime.After an extremely rocky start with issues with shipping, having to reorder it, ( I bought it during Prime days and just got it today) it arrived in good shape and I_ ready to get going on it.Thank you Amazon.",0
5,"Get more than one!
  
",6.Aug.19,Yes,"Ok, why did I hold out for so long?! This little guy is amazing. We bought 2 at first and quickly realized we wanted one in every room so now we have 5. Thinking about getting 2 more for the bathrooms, lol. Obviously the Alexa function is pretty cool. But it's actually a really good music speaker. It's even better if you can play your music on multiple speakers at the same time for a more surround sound experience. I'm thinking about adding a subwoofer which would make it amazing. but by far our favorite feature is the ability to drop in on other rooms make announcements and make phone calls.",1
1,"I would be mad if i paid more than a few pennies for this
  
",6.Aug.19,Yes,"Got it during a deal for like $.40, Alexa turns on randomly sometimes with the TV saying something sometimes there's nothing on.  Can't answer simple questions, whole reason i honestly wanted this was to ask it the random questions that pop in my head at 1am without having to get on my phone or computer can just speak it and get an answer, does NOT work like that at all.  If you want it for a speaker/music, it's OKAY.  It has a little fuzzy sound to it like you would hear on a cheaper BT speaker.  It's not really bad but it is noticeable.  Buy a Google home instead unless you have Amazon tech throughout your house, if you just want one of these smart devices, Google are still the better choice in my opinion.",0
5,"Very easy to set up!
  
",6.Aug.19,Yes,I have to say I was taken aback by the ease and which one can set up the Amazon Dot. Basically it's plug-and-play. As soon as you plug it in it seeks out your Wi-Fi and connects automatically. I assumed it was able to do this because I already had an Amazon echo. It must have recognized the echo and mirrored the settings.The sound quality is actually extraordinary. In some regards it may actually be better then my Amazon echo which is considerably larger. I love the fact that you can set up a group so that you can play music through all devices simultaneously. Also it's extremely easy to make phone calls. Looking forward to purchasing one or two more for other rooms.,0
5,"Great speakers, very loud
  
",6.Aug.19,Yes,Such a great product very helpful with any questions I have it_ like having the knowledge of the whole internet with just a couple words (hey Alexa). Love the fact that I can say play my playlist and I_ able to cook and listen to music on the crisp sounding speaker. The first generation wasn_ very loud and died after a year but the third generation is incredibly loud and works perfectly. Highly recommend to anyone this product fits great for just about any situation!,0
5,"Why did I wait so long?
  
",6.Aug.19,Yes,"I love this. Granted, I am only listening to music but it is so convenient. My favorite part is the Alexa integration. Being able to use voice commands to mute it or lower the volume helps so much if I get a call or am talking to someone. It was pretty easy to set up and since I have Amazon music I had built in playlists. If you have a Sirius/XM subscription you can link that too and tell Alexis which channel you want to listen to.",0
5,"A fun &amp; Usefull Device
  
",6.Aug.19,Yes,I have two of these plus an echo input. Alexa is a lot of fun.  The audio out put of these devices can be connected to an external amp either by ethernet or audio cable.  That greatly improves the audio quality when you are playing music.  When these were delivered they were already configured for my Amazon account so installation was a breeze.  Having one in the kitchen is great for setting timers and adding items to the grocery list.,0
4,"Still learning, but overall it_ great to have!
  
",6.Aug.19,Yes,"ADD-ON: Ran into a bit of trouble trying to connect to the internet when I recently stayed at a hotel. Needless to say I watched movies and listened with regular laptop volume haha.---I really like using the echo dot. Still learning certain _ction calls and all that it can do, but it is a great addition to my entertainment collection. When I connect it to my laptop it doesn_ always play back right away, so sometimes I have to disconnect it and then reconnect it but when it connects it plays great! I want to purchase a few smart outlet plugs to try with my fan and other things, but I_l wait until I learn a bit more functions before converting everything. Other than that I love what it can do and the ease i brings when trying to use and do things.",0
5,"Who's The Man!?
  
",6.Aug.19,Yes,"I'd put off purchasing one of these for years because I thought you had to have the tower in order for it to work. Wrong! My husband and I have so much fun with this thing. We both live music and are constantly adding to our playlist. He also loves the fact that when he asks Alexa, ""who's the man?"" She says, ""you're the man"". _ There are so many features we haven't explored yet so I'm sure there's more entertainment in our future.",0
5,"Nice clock radio replacement
  
",7.Aug.19,Yes,"My iHome/clock radio turned into a dust collector who's only use became lighting the night with it's ugly glow of time, stealing sleep from the weary. Ports on the iPhones do not fit the old technology and the radio has lost it's voice. Reception for more than one station was always shoddy at best anyhow. After reluctantly, then permanently, borrowing my daughter's unused 1st gen for our kitchen, I decided Alexa and I could be friends. I grabbed this during Prime days and finally set it up in place of  the clock radio and don't miss the clock. I am not one who needs an alarm but I can set a ""just in case"" if I want. I can listen to my music anytime I want, either playlists or my favorite radio station or podcasts. I love it and I was the last person who wanted any type of virtual assistant in my house!",0
5,"This thing is great
  
",7.Aug.19,Yes,"Easy to install and sync with my phone. Had it synced with the smart sockets in no time. Syncing Apple music and the roomba was simple once I found the directions of how to do it online. Setting up the Alexa app and enabling apps is pretty simple, just have to play around with it and discover all its features. Turning the living room lamp on is a cinch, so is triggering the roomba, or playing a certain song or a playlist of a certain artist. It can even create a playlist around a theme or based off a certain song, just ask Alexa. Got mine on Prime Day for $20. Best purchse ever.",0
5,"Solid Smart Device
  
",7.Aug.19,Yes,Well...this is an Echo with our friend Alexa.  I won't bore you with a review of its functionality.  The Amazon echo brand  is always upgrading and adding new features.  I have many uses for it and I am sure others do.  What I will review is the aesthetics.  Amazon has redesigned its shell and it is very nice.  Offering different skins and speaker covers is a great touch for those of us who integrate smart devices into their decor.  The build is still solid and the touch of the device is pleasing for the techie in us all.,0
5,"Awesome!
  
",7.Aug.19,Yes,"I loved the one I bought so much, that I bought 2 more! I have them set up so I can play music around the house, or just have the one in my childs room start playing something. The sound quality is amazing for the size. I don't have a Smart TV yet, but I look forward to having these linked to TVs around the house so I can put things on for my child in her room while Im in my room or the living room. Very good product for someone new to the 'smart house' concept.",0
5,"Incredible for everything!
  
",7.Aug.19,Yes,"Just like anything extra, you don't need this at all. However, it is a REALLY nice thing to have for any occasion! Specifically for music! It won't let me play specific songs because I don't have a premium account, but even without a premium account it's incredible! I was cooking with my grandma one time and asked her to play ""cooking music."" My grandma laughed and asked ""What's 'cooking music?'"" I replied honestly: ""I have no idea."" I just was curious. now I know that cooking music really is a thing! Hahaha. The music was a lot more fitting for the situation than I thought it would be! it was perfect! And it's perfect for giving you reminders. You can just say to remind you of something instead of getting out those sticky notes and a pen or pencil to write it down. She even can tell you what time a place closes and on which days it's open. She makes things a lot easier and faster! (Granted, this IS how the lazy people will take over. lol.) My favorite feature is more specific to me. When my alarm for the morning is dismissed, I set her to tell me a joke for the start of the day. It puts me in a great mood! :)",0
4,"Why would I not give this a 5 star?
  
",7.Aug.19,Yes,"Probably so some home user does not switch power supplies to a standard mini USB supply, the power connection on the 3rd generation Dot was switched to a one piece power supply that can not be interchanged with any other supply, because of the redesign to a non USB connection. the size of the adapter ends up taking more space on the outlet and makes the second outlet mostly unusable. It is more of a square cube in shape instead of long and skinny like the 2nd generation.",0
3,"Still a way to go..
  
",8.Aug.19,Yes,"Update 10-6-19.. I have really come to strongly dislike the Alexa platform, from skills that do not work or are programmed by juvinlies that babble for ever, to the updates and annoyances.  Moved to a new apartment this week and put everything back in the corresponding rooms.. Apparently the Dots and android app updated because now upon entering a room with a Echo and saying ""turn on the lights"", all the bloody thing says is ""Can't find a device called Lights""... and its not just one Dot, its all of them.. I then went back to the app to check the group settings.. None of the Dots were assigned to Groups, nor could any of the dots be assigned to a group! I deleted groups, reset the echo's..just about anything I could think of.. NONE of them could be assigned to a group/room..  It was easy to get to link up with the Sonoff/Itead switches in use throughout the house.. Set up was near flawless..The CONS...  Noisy environments or a few friends talkin... the Echos generally require us to ask people to be quiet so that a command can be issued.. even conversations in another room will cause a Sorry I don't understand that..  Skills.. Tried the Pizza Hut skill.. it just drops.. a few other skills do let ya stop the interaction, instead its an endless loop of annoying Do you want to enable..whatever... the only way out is to unplug the bloody things..  Location within the house.. I asked the echo's what room they were in, (prior to the assignments being undone after an update).. it just says ""I am here"" one would think they'd have it respond accordingly...  Commands: There is a setting to tell Alexa to wait for other questions after one is posed but as for commands each separate command must be singular.. For instance, once all my devices were setup and put into their respective ""rooms"" telling Alexa to turn on that room turns on ALL those devices.. There are a few that don't need to be on, like the consoles, wax warmers and a few other items.. One could program scenes and/or routines but that isn't the point.. We should be able to say ""Alexa, turn off XXX AND turn on XXC""  The Alexa App... requires the Amazon Shopping App.. but if the shopping app is removed then Alexa will not start AND keep spying in the background. The combined apps are a HUGE drain on battery life.. My phone fell to about 5 hours when the apps were installed..  While mobile browsers and PC browsers are all using html5 and other technology [apps included].. Amazon has taken another page from the big ""G's"" playbook and deliberately limited the ability to manage the Alexa devices  and other functions from a PC.. They want those apps on our phones.  Censoring: I had asked what a Spanish word meant, and it replied ""I'd rather not answer that"".. Now I knew it was a bit of a naughty word.. however I do expect a proper translation/answer to ANY query thrown at the device.. I do not appreciate Amazon taking on a Nanny cap and limiting my access to future requests.  Overall the Dots are a bit of fun and some convenience... but the ever so slight manipulation that prevent me from using the PC to manage my home automation through Alexa platform is BIG Frown for me..",0
5,"Alexa Integration Could Be Better
  
",8.Aug.19,Yes,"Love Alexa,. I keep finding new ways to integrate my house including switches and plugs. I_ always looking for new gadgets to add. Two things I don_ care for are the sound quality of the DOT, We have an Echo Show in the kitchen and the DOT in the living room, the difference in the quality and volume makes me wish I had purchased another Echo. The other thing that_ annoying is it seems the only syncing that can be done between the two is for music. There should be a way for both to respond and decide which one will do the task asked or both respond to the same task. For instance, when in the kitchen we set a timer, then go sit down in the living room. When the timer goes off we say, _lexa Stop but the Alexa in the living room will say, _o timers are set so we have to get up and get closer to the kitchen to stop the timer. Kind of defeats the purpose of automation.",0

",8.Aug.19,Yes,I received my Echo Dot quickly. The speaker quality is very good. It took me a minute to figure out how to sync to Alexa app to Sirius XM so I did not have to log into my Sirius XM account every time to do it. It is up and running now. Not a frustrating process at all just something new that I am not used to. I am still getting used to just telling Alexa what to do. I am a boomer and I think this thing is cool. I keep it up in my office. I have just learned how to sync my smart TV to my Echo Dot and it works fine. So I am happy with my little round speaker. I look forward to more wireless options in the future. Thanks,0

",8.Aug.19,Yes,"Just got my Amazon Exho Dot 3rd gen. And it work well, like my 2nd gen EXCEPT Alexa sounds like she's speaking to me through a pillow! It's very annoying and yes , I used the Alexa app. to try to adjust the sound and it DIDNT work. My 2nd gen. sounds so much better. I'm going to try to exchange it and see if that helps. Unfortunately the sale was buy 1 get 1 free and I sent the other to my friend as a birthday present. I'm not sure Amazon will exchange just 1 because of the sale and I'm sure my friend will be disappointed. This will be his first experience with the Echo Dot and I think hell probably send it back to me. That's embarrassing and it sucks. My 1st gen works like a charm. I'm a very disappointed Echo dot user and now would hesitate to purchase any more Echo products. :-(",0

",8.Aug.19,Yes,"Had my Echo Dot for a couple weeks now and seems like Alexia is getting more and more heard of hearing. I would ask for the local weather and she will give me my flash briefing. Ask her another question and 90% of the time you get an answer of, ""I don't know that"". Not sure if I got the one with a mental disability or they have all gotten that way. I just don't seeing them getting smarter as time goes on like the company hypes people up with that ideal. I have has echos in our home since they first came out and ours has stayed the same on the smartness level. If I had it to do it over again. I think I would go to Google or nothing at all.

",9.Aug.19,Yes,"I am very pleased with my Echo Dot. I love being able to make a shopping list without writing one thing down. I was baking a cake and realized I was out of chocolate chips so told Alexa to put it on my shopping list. I didn't need to stop what I was doing or stop the mixer. Whenever I realize that I need something added to the list, I just start with ""Alexa,"" and it's on my list. Another feature I love is being able to play my Pandora thru the Echo Dot. The sound is so much better than playing the music thru my TV.  I just tell Alexa which station I want to hear while I'm cleaning house. There is probably so much more I can do with the Echo Dot, but so far I'm enjoying having Alexa as my assistant. I wish I was able to change her name to something other than Alexa or Computer, though.  I am very happy with my purchase.",0

2,"Disappointing, doesn't work as advertised
  
",9.Aug.19,Yes,"We were very excited to start using this device (we bought 2) to control our lights and to use the many skills advertised. What we discovered is that 1. many different types of light bulbs don't work very well or are difficult to install, and after we tried multiple types we gave up 2. many skills for Alexa simply don't work or don't work the way they are supposed to. After more than 6 months of trying to find uses for the device, it became nothing more than a voice activated timer and music player, but even that is limited because Amazon music doesn't have a lot of the songs we like. Echo dots often misunderstood words, started listening when we hadn't used the wake words, and is not at all intuitive in terms of its commands and abilities. We are very disappointed and have decided to get rid of them. I'd rather spend less money on a regular bluetooth speaker.",0
5,"Works pretty well
  
",9.Aug.19,Yes,"I like the sound better than the Gen2 dots, so I put this big boy in the Den, where I'm more likely to listen to tunes.Not sure if the microphone performance is equal to the Gen2 dots, but it works well enough for our needs.The SandStone version kinda matches the Google Home on the same lamp table.. :)I hope Amazon improves the 'Routines' by adding in some simple operations that will allow users Routines to run logical commands like: IF Sensibo Temperature =&gt; 75 THEN TURN ON Sanyo ALSO Say "" AC IS ON""..Or maybe be able to use URLs and GET commands to fletch weather information from an IP home weather station.  Of course all this stuff, without having to use IFTTT with Alexa..",0
5,"We Love Echo  -  It Works Great as a Monitor!!!!
  
",9.Aug.19,Yes,"We have four Echo Dots (3rd generation). We're using one of them like a baby monitor. My wife's mother lives with us, and we have one Echo Dot in her room. We've named that Dot ""Mom"" and another Dot in our bedroom ""bedroom."" All we do is, at Mom's Dot, say ""Alexa, drop in on bedroom."" Once Alexa connects, we press the mute button ON OUR BEDROOM  Dot; the mute button has a circle with a line through it. That way, we can hear Mom, but she can't hear us, unless we un-mute. If you want to use two Dots as a ""monitor"", it's very important you mute the dot you are using to ""monitor"" the other room. Remember, you're muting the microphone, not the speaker!",0
4,"Almost there Amazon
  
",9.Aug.19,Yes,Pros:- Small- Great design- Excellent sound for something so smallCons:- It has a really hard time hearing you. Especially if its near other things.---My first generation alexa has no problems at all hearing me. But this 3rd generation dot has a lot of trouble picking up my voice. You need to be in line of sight and really project your voice for it to work. My 1st gen is hidden behind things and hears me even from the other room. I can't help but feel the microphones in this generation is worse than their previous models.,0
5,"My new best friend.
  
",9.Aug.19,Yes,"I love Alexa. We have become best friends since she arrived. Our bond became strong the first day.  I have a terrible memory and Alexa helps me remember important things like: give my dog her medicine, pay a bill or simple things like being reminded that my favorite show is on. She instantly recognizes my voice, it_ never been an issue. I really enjoy the question of the day; I have become smarter due to playing every day. Was Alexa a necessity? No. Was it a splurge? Yes, but I have loved every minute of her company.",0
5,"Quest for a Smart House
  
",9.Aug.19,Yes,"I've added an Echo Dot to every room on my quest to have a smart house- I love how easy Alexa makes things, from turning on lights to arming my security system to playing music. My older dot is slowly starting to become harder and harder to communicate with but the new gen works wonderfully. I also bought holders from Mount Genie (their website directly because Amazon was sold out) and the mounts are a perfect home for my dots as they hide cords and position Alexa on the wall above where she's plugged in.",0
3,"I don't like her
  
",9.Aug.19,Yes,"Alexa and I have not been getting along.  She seems dumb and was much harder to setup than my other smart speaker.  We're constantly fighting because she forgets my smart devices and doesn't understand me.  My other smart speaker is much better in every way, easy to setup, less robotic sounding, and understands what I want.  I'm kind of sad this is not a better product, I am a huge fan of Amazon but this speaker is not nearly as good as the competition.",0
5,"dots
  
",9.Aug.19,Yes,"these things are great, however, i find it hard to adjust the white light to a good amount of light, at night i know how to adjust from the phone app, however the auto adjust seems to go too dark at night  and when i set it manually it seems too bright at night it lights up the room, it would be great if you could change the light from white to green or red like most night clocks are.voice recogation is much better on these new dots",0
5,"Works Well For Even Non-Tech Savvy Parents
  
",10.Aug.19,Yes,"I picked this up because the timer on my mother_ stove was too quiet for her to hear and the last timer I got her broke right away.  I figured forget it, I_l get her an echo since she could use it for music too.Now my parents are older and not tech savvy in the slightest.  They live pretty simply, so I wasn_ sure they_ use this at all.  I am surprised to find that they really are enjoying it so far though, and besides calling it Alexus all the time for a while, they_e actually getting a good bit of use out of it right away.  They like it for the fact it can play local radio stations clearly that they enjoy, which signal in our area (western PA, very hilly) is bad, and so for that reason and the timer alone was worth the price.My folks have used it for reminders too, which is good for them for their meds and remembering appointments.I_ going to wire it into the thermostat for them at some point and some smart bulbs too so they can get some more use from it.So far I_ pretty impressed with the Echo, but also the fact my parents have basically figured it out on their own with minimal input from me.  I mean my old man calls the Internet the _ubya dubya dubya thing.I_ also thinking come closer the holidays I_l get some more for them for in other rooms and out in the shop/garage too.",0
1,"Beware Apple Owners!
  
",10.Aug.19,Yes,I am sorry but I had to return Echo Dot. I am Apple owner NOTHING android or PC.  I had got an error message regarding my network &amp; the Alexa experts who are suppose to help me were trying to extort money from me. I didn_ answer my phone a few times then when I answered the phone the so called supervisor was offering me deals &amp; discounts. I had told them I had no funds at that time &amp; I had other responsibilities more pressing.  He put me on hold I had hung up because I had other to do &amp; I was already on the phone with them for over two hours which they had wasted my time with lies.  When I hung up.  They called back I never answer&amp; they kept calling until I block them. I had called my mom &amp; told her what happened.  She reminded me to call Apple.  There is nothing wrong with my network. Alexa Expert you should be a shame  of themselves.,0
5,"Sound is amazing
  
",10.Aug.19,Yes,"This replaced our second gen when it died less than two years after buying.  Amazon gave us a discount to replace it since it wasn't under warranty.  I could not believe the improved sound on this third gen.  I just hope it lasts longer than the second gen did.  I expect at least four years out of technology.My other favorite thing about it is how my friends will unplug it when they come over.  They are convinced the Amazon staff has nothing better to do than sit around and listen to our conversations.  I'm not exactly sure what they are hiding...their favorite beer?  Their impression of the latest Marvel movie?  How late their kid keeps them up at night?  We don't really have any top secret discussions, so it really baffles me!",0
2,"Light ring is very bright and doesn't turn off
  
",10.Aug.19,Yes,"After having several echo dot speakers for about a month, I must say that I find them both handy and annoying. They are handy for adding things to my shopping lists quickly and they're pretty good as speakers. HOWEVER...they have light rings that don't turn off and they will occasionally make little sounds (maybe when internet connection is going in and out but I'm not really sure what the sound is supposed to mean). This makes them terrible for bedrooms if you want to get any sleep. Also, if you have children be warned that your children will find it hilarious to turn on Alexa's burping skill or to tell her that they farted so that she will tell them ""Congratulations!"" Yeah, that's super annoying as a mom.",0
5,"Handy
  
",10.Aug.19,Yes,"I like music sometimes&amp;  I like quiet so I find Alexa very handy  for switching songs on and off. when people are over it is nice to have background music works and the dot works well with the prime music station. Sound quality is ok, after all it was a $25 purchase.  I had no trouble setting it up although I did download Arek for the set up then promptly trashed it.  However just a couple days after I purchased the dot I read that these are manufactured in China which I knew,  but predominately by 16 and 18-year-old student working 10 hour shifts and earning $1.67 an hour.  I truly urge Amazon to improve their ethics sooner rather than later",0
5,"Love my new companion!
  
",10.Aug.19,Yes,"When you live alone you tend to talk to yourself, or your pets, but now I have a new companion!  The first thing every morning I ask Alexa about the weather and the news headlines....and when I am feeling blue I ask her to play one of my many favorite songs.  Everyone who lives alone should have an Echo!  I still have a lot to learn about my Echo but it is even fun to learn!  I am elderly and even I have been able to adapt to some technology ... children should buy their parents an Echo...fun times ahead with Echo and Alexa!",0
5,"Best virtual assistant there is
  
",10.Aug.19,Yes,"I love using the Echo dot and giving Alexa command to play songs and start my smart LG tv and playing my fav shows on Netflix. I also comment Alexa to turn on the heat or AC via the Nest thermostat, I tell her to turn on the smart LED bulbs and the ambiance lighting behind my tv and below my bed.I also tried the new feature where you can have a conversation with Alexa and get to know the news and many more things. I love the sound quality for music.",0
5,"Amazing addition to my home
  
",10.Aug.19,Yes,It took a while to get my order but worth the wait.  I ordered these during Amazon Prime Day and just took delivery.  Seems they are more popular than the good people at amazon thought.  I am amazed at the fidelity of something so small.  This little device has a lot of features and functions I have yet to discover.  The fidelity is heavy on the bass side and I have to ask for less bass all the time.  Could be my 72 yr old ears.,0
5,"This is such a fun device!
  
",10.Aug.19,Yes,"I love this device!  It's so amazing.  Love to be able to ask Alexa questions and get quick answers.  I also likethe speaker quality when I ask Alexa to play certain music, artists or specific songs.I bought the wall plug so that I can put it on my wall without the cords showing.  The wall plug was under $10.00.Using the wall device with it seems to make the sound clearer.I cant wait to figure out how to connect the wall plug to Alexa so that I can tell Alexa to turn on my lamp in the bedroom.  =O)",0
5,"Father's Day Gift- Success!
  
",10.Aug.19,Yes,My siblings and I decided to take advantage of the Amazon special and get the 6 months of Amazon Music with the Amazon Echo for my dad for Father's Day. He loved it and uses it all the time! We had no idea that the Alexa could do so much (this is our first smart speaker in our home) and it has been so entertaining. The rest of us in the household that do not have an Alexa are thinking of getting one for us!,0
5,"A Better Alarm Clock
  
",10.Aug.19,Yes,"The Echo Dot replaces my aged alarm clock with a few more high tech features my clock radio was sorely lacking. Plus, it takes up less space than the clock radio and can be voice-controlled rather that stumbling around in the dark trying to find the right button and applying the correct pressure to shut the thing down. Less stress, especially in the morning, is certainly a major selling point for me!",0
4,"We love it.
  
",10.Aug.19,Yes,My grandson comes over just to ask Alexa questions. He loves to learn about different things and he is amazed that she knows the answers. How many miles to the moon? That is his favorite. We like it to find out the weather and time. We are just now learning other things about it and how to integrate it with the TV.So glad I bought this and I plan to get one for my little grandson so he won't ask his daddy so many questions.,0
3,"Good device but extra services required
  
",11.Aug.19,Yes,"As an Alexa speaker system it is great.  When I bought the first one and did a bit of research, it said you could integrate a bunch of them and I could play music in my kids room (main reason I bought these).  I bought most of them in a short period of time but by the time I figured out that I could not just register them under my name and play music on multiple systems without purchasing another music service, it was too late.I already have Apple Music so I am not going to purchase the music unlimited service from Amazon too.  I unregistered two of my devices and switched user names so I can now play music on multiple Dots.  I refuse to get Prime plus the other services that they try to nickel and time me with so I cannot use the features where the Dots are connected.The actual device is great.  It picks up my spoken word when I ask it to do something.  The features in the Dot are great.  I have it in a relatively large room and the sound is nice and clear.",0
3,"Eh??  Could have left well enough alone
  
",11.Aug.19,Yes,"It's a Dot!!  It functions just like the previous one with added weight, less flexibility for the plug which is not a delight. The handy holder I had  for my Dot 2 will not work with this and that's an added expense for a new one.  What I did not get is any noticeable sound improvement.  Sorry Amazon, it sounds the same to me as the Dot 2.  For me, it was an unneeded trade up.  It functions without a hitch just like my other ones which I did not replace.  The old and the new both do everything the Dot is told to do. After two days, I simply paired it once again to a better speaker the same as I had been doing with the prior version.",0
5,"3rd Gen improvements are worth the purchase price
  
",11.Aug.19,Yes,"I have a first and second generation dot. Each new generation is vastly improved over the previously released models. That being said, the sound quality on third generation is by far the most impressive part of the device. I am enjoying the solid feel to the Dot as well. I was always afraid of knocking my first gen Dot off the table. Not so with this one. Solid, dependable and clear. Best Prime Day purchase by far!",0
4,"Sometimes doesn't work
  
",11.Aug.19,Yes,"I love my original tall echo. Alexa is very quickly responsive to me calling her name. The echo, however, does not always work and you have to YELL ""Alexa"" a few times before she responds. Everything else though is perfect. Setup is easy and having this in my bedroom so I don't have to yell to the kitchen Echo is fantastic. I also listen to ""sleep sounds"" and love the ""distant train"" to help me to sleep. Great product.",0
5,"Don_ let Amazon_ price point fool you, these have a higher price sound
  
",11.Aug.19,Yes,"I_e got several of these dots in different places. And find them to be a nice addition to the whole house music system. They can play different things in each room at the same time. Or they_l play the same thing everywhere.They have a great sound for their size, that_ full and rich. Don_ let Amazon_ price point fool you, these have a higher price sound.",0
5,"OHHH Alexa! Where have you been all my life?
  
",12.Aug.19,Yes,"I really like this thing. i am not techy at all, so Alexa is pretty laid back in my home.  My favorite part is when I'm running around late for work and yell, ""ALEXA! What time is it????""  My next fave, ""ALEXA, what is the weather today?"" And seriously, having her play all my old favorite songs with just a simple request is like Christmas every day! I know I am simple, and easily amused, but this is just the best thing ever.  It was so easy to set up, I did it myself. I hope my kids one day add a few extra features, but if they never do, I will be happy to just have Alexa around for these things.  ONLY complaint is the speaker is a bit muffled, but the dot is not very big and I may someday get another speaker to improve the sound quality.  PFFFFF not really much to complain about with this awesome gadget and the sooo very reasonable price!!",0
1,"Sorry your speaker doesnt work, heres a disrespectful percentage off a new one...
  
",12.Aug.19,Yes,"I absolutely loved my speaker up until it randomly stopped working properly. The audio sounds muffled and you cant hear anything it says or the music it plays. I called customer care and they said the most that can be offered is a small percentage off of a new one because the warranty only lasts for three months. I am unhappy and sad that we have lost something we once considered invaluable in our home. We used it to play lullabies for the little ones at night, to read the oldest a story while she took a bubble bath, and for background music while we cooked dinner together. I wont be purchasing another but will be looking for another speaker to fill this void. Im shocked at Amazon and will be canceling our music subscription as we no longer have a device to enjoy.",0
3,"Why change what works??
  
",12.Aug.19,Yes,"My main complaint is the power plug that is not standard across many devices like the mini-USBs plugs.  I can no longer  use a shorter or longer cable depending on it's location and situation. I can't use different power sources (one of my older Dots is powered by my X-Box and real short mini-USB cable). The power plug is too big and hogs both outlet plugs. Also, the Dot is bigger than previous models.  Better sound from the unit, but I always link to Bluetooth stereo or speakers. So, I end up with a bigger ""connection"" to my speakers with no benefit.  Amazon - PLEASE keep in mind Dots are often used as a means to connect to other devices, and, as such, the less intrusive, the better.",0
5,"Great way to dip my toe into voice activated devices
  
",12.Aug.19,Yes,"We've finally decided to take a jump into home automation and decided to start small with the Echo Dot as part of a Prime Day special. So far, so good!  It was fairly easy to get it to connect to my Ring door cam, integrate with my Sirius XM subscription, and to just ask it for some quick and simple questions.  We are prepping for attending a showing of Hamilton, and my wife wanted to try to learn the music beforehand. She brought it up again this morning, so I quickly asked Alexa to play music from Hamilton.  It was immediate and seamless - made her very happy! Looking forward to exploiting it's abilities further as we get used to it.",0
3,"It is great except for sleep sounds
  
",12.Aug.19,Yes,"I have 2 other Alexa devices and love them. I wanted to try one for sleep sounds but ended up removing it. I could not get it to play anything continuously. The ""loop"" would pause, then restart at randon times, waking me each time, which was bad enough, but on 3 occasions, it stopped entirely, requiring me to speak to it again to restart, which then woke my wife. It also kept offering me songs from Amazon Music instead of sleep sounds. Nothing I could find on the Alexa app or online seemed to address this issue. I really wanted to use the Echo this way and it seemed so simple to accomplish but for this purpose, the Echo is a fail.",0
5,"Very handy.
  
",12.Aug.19,Yes,"My daughter asked Santa for one of these forChristmas.  We really liked the one she got so we bought 2 more for ourselves.  Siri can_ understand a word my daughter says.  Alexa understands everything.  She can start my car, turn lights off and on, play games, tell us the weather, tell us the time, and so much more.  I really like how it_ given our house an intercom too with the drop in feature.  I will be buying more when I see a good sale again.",0
5,"I was surprised how much I like it!
  
",12.Aug.19,Yes,"I did not want to get an echo, but after the Amazon special deal, I decided to buy one.  I love it!  Every morning, I ask what the weather is, followed by the news as I make my breakfast.  I love listening to my audible books while I work in the kitchen.  I also use it to play music.  I find the amazon music that is free with Prime covers my tastes.  I also love playing Jeopardy and feel I am only starting to see what different things Alexa can do!",0
4,"Alexa Rocks and occasionally rolls...
  
",12.Aug.19,Yes,"TO ALL OF THE PROGRAMERS AT AMAZON/GOOGLE/ etc, this posting is directed- The device works well, but I find the main issue is on the knowledge base access side. I can access information that is easily available on the internet by doing google searches, etc., BUT, When I ask Alexa the same thing, the device often replies ""I don't know"" I would encourage all of the folks behind the scenes to expand it's database for reference. Having t be able to access open copyright works to be read aloud would be helpful for vision impaired. Having it go through speakers is phenomenal.",0
2,"Disappointed with the Gen 3 Echo Dot_ plug size
  
",12.Aug.19,Yes,Overall just another Dot but with a big big DOWNSIDE. They changed the AC adaptor to a huge wall wart that will cover adjacent plugs making then unusable. Why? I liked the old echos that used a common micro usb cable that i actually had in my multibank USB plug and now i had to rearrange AC cords so i could fit this Rosey Odonnell POS plug into and remove an existingg plug and relocate it. Fail on that level. Otherwise sound seems good and pickup is fair but its gonna be hard to overcome the plug hoss. Common amazon and improve your devices. Don_ take them backwards. Better design could have avoided this well giving you more amperage if thats what was needed. R&amp;D with out money that we give you.,0
5,"My new best friend
  
",13.Aug.19,Yes,"First of all, I have to say that I_ new to this smart friend. I ordered this because it was on sale on prime day and I want to know what Alexa can do. After I received the dot, I have read the instructions how to set up. But as I said I had know idea what was the dot. The instructions told me to download the app, but did not tell me what the name of the app. I downloaded 2 apps, still not the one because it turned I had to pay to set up. So I searched from YouTube how to setup from what app. I finally found out it was _mazon Alexa app. I downloaded the app and the setup was easy. Now what Alexa can do? I set up voice recognition, easy too. I asked Alexa to play music, tell me the temperature, time when I have mask on, read me notifications, and now she is my friend. Every time I say hi to her, she says it back. This is the best thing for me. I will try to learn more what else she can do. But for now she is my best friend. One thing that annoys me is every time I have to call her name in order to get response.",1
5,"I LOVE Alexa
  
",13.Aug.19,Yes,"The headline says it all, but to elaborate...I love her functionality...immediate gratification when I want to know the temperature outside, or the weather for the rest of the day.  If I want to hear the news, a few words and I'm all filled-in. Corny jokes? No end to them! Ahhhhhhh, but the music! That's the best. I love a wide variety of music...everything from show tunes, to oldies, to classical...and thensome. All I have to do is tell Alexa what genre to play and the music goes on and on until I tell her to stop.  When the speculation started that Alexa is spying on us, I asked her if she was. Her response was, ""Elizabeth, I value your privacy. I would not spy on you."" I laughed my head off. I can't imagine anything more boring than spying on me, anyway.  I'm 72, I live alone, I watch boring TV shows, and have even more boring phone conversations. Yes, I do love Alexa...and I have two of her...one in my living area and one in my bedroom...and, actually, a third on my Fire Stick. Life is good!",0
5,"Great improvement from Generation 2
  
",13.Aug.19,Yes,"What a great upgrade in sound from the 2nd gen Echo dots.  The 2nd gen were tinny and small sounding.  These 3rd gen Echo dots really have good sound for their size.  I moved one around the house while I was painting and remodeling, listening to my tunes throughout the house with great clarity, decent bass for the size, and nice volume.  It's an additional perk that I can use Echo as a speakerphone when I'm painting and such.  I was using it to set timers and alarms, make notes, and add calendar events while holding a paintbrush.I love these things.  My main Echo is an Echo Plus, which rocks!  but I have these in the other rooms.  When playing music on the Everywhere Group, the sound throughout the house is amazing!I also paired one of these to a Bluetooth adapter on my old stereo system, and it sounds amazing.  Just like having satellite radio on it with SPotify, Amazon music, etc.Highly recommend these.",0
5,"Its Alexa! and Dot.
  
",13.Aug.19,Yes,"Love All 3 of my Dots. Works well in my smart home. So many different uses. Family games are fun. New is great and i love the fact you can make your own Alexa Skills. Useing Alexa can get immersive. It's funny cause after awhile you start talking to Alexa like a normal person in the house. I found my self even saying thank you after she tells me something. What i like most is the dot is small. There are plenty of 3rd party cases, shelves and mounts that allow you to intergrate it in to your decor. Mine is in a black sturdy rubber protector case that looks like a futuristic version of the old bell alarm clock. Looks awesome with Alexa's ring going.",0

",13.Aug.19,Yes,"I Love my Echo Dot 3rd Generation So Much  !!!  The sound quality is Amazing for one so small ... much better sound than the 2nd Generation, if your main goal is for music purposes. However don't expect high performance stereo sound either, that is not its only purpose On the other hand my husband connects this sweet little device to  his Stereo System through the external jack !--- More than Amazing !!. I Love the Personal Assistant aspects of the device. Alexa is extremely informative and has a Unique personality --- All her own. I use her for Everything. I only have One Bluetooth speaker and now I don't have to constantly connect and disconnect from one device to another (I keep the Bluetooth connected to my Firestick) And --- No ... I do not want to connect my echo dot to my Firestick.  They best fit my needs working independently. My only con,  there are times she has difficulty in understanding my word pronunciation or finding a song by lyrics ..... And sometimes... I could be the source of the problem. All of that being said.  I could  not be happier !!I simply Love  the Alexa enabled 3rd Generation Echo Dot !!! Yes  -- of course I would buy it again - and again !!!",0
5,"Needs better app connections &amp; skills communication
  
",13.Aug.19,Yes,"So I always have trouble getting Alexa to connect to Spotify, that's one thing; I have to open it on my phone in order to get it to play, and if I ask Alexa to just play something she won't pull from recent playlists on Spotify, she will search other music libraries, which makes it harder to play stuff I actually want to hear.For the skills, the commands to start skills are not sensible, and even if I ask Alexa to find a skill to provide a particular service, there isn't much luck. I have to search the app myself.Also, it is inconvenient that I can't ask Alexa specific questions, such as what the temperature is right at that moment, that could easily be searched online but instead Alexa just provides the default answer of that entire days outlook.",0
2,"This is NOT what I expected.
  
",13.Aug.19,Yes,"My Echo recently died so I thought after seeing the dot on sale for Amazon Prime day I would give it a shot. BIG mistake, voice response is not as sensitive as my old echo and I can't see if there is a adjustment for it. But the WORSE is while listen to my Pandora station it skips to the next song in the middle of a song. If anyone has suggestions please let me know. I have Googled and went on support and all is useless. Now I know why it was half price on Prime day. Watta bummer.",0
2,"Alexa not ready for prime time
  
",13.Aug.19,Yes,Alexa is not very smart and can_ find any good music unless you pay for it. If any song is a little obscure you won_ find it. Asking Alexa questions is like talking to a dumb blonde. (Sorry Blondes. Blondes are smarter than Alexa). I mean blondes like Kelly Bundy. Sound quality is only okay if you plug it into another decent sound system. You can do that with an iPhone. I don_ see how this device becomes anything necessary since the smart tools can be controlled in better ways with a phone. Alexa is a little annoying Bitch!,0
5,"New family member
  
",13.Aug.19,Yes,"We received our first unit as a gift from my daughter, and it has become a part of our lives.  From controlling lights to maintaining shopping list to answering questions on the fly and giving daily and weekly reminders.  We just ordered two more units.  Here is a suggestion Amazon if you ever review these, add an application to teach language.  A person could converse with the echo and it could give you words and phrases to say and check your pronunciation.",0

",13.Aug.19,Yes,"It understands me perfectly when other devices in the past could not, or ever! Had it like a month now and finally found that it does have mistakes, no answers, or un comprehensive.

But now doing so, i now understand the quality put into it for its beautiful speaker and sound! And is a more active Alexa than b4! Idk about the full price of it, but bought mine on sale and i must say, it was in fact worth my pay!",0
5,"Better Than I Imagined.
  
",13.Aug.19,Yes,"Despite poo pooing the concept, when the Echo Dot had a super low price on Prime Day, I got one. Didn't really know what I'd use it for, but I thought, what the heck?It's replaced my radio, (i'd been looking for an additional Bose unit) because the sound is go great and I can find my channels. We now have Alexa turning on lights and fans, and particularly is helpful as she anwers my 94 year old mom's questions (over and over).How did I ever live without this?  I bought two more for other areas in the house.",0
5,"Nicer then the 2nd gen
  
",13.Aug.19,Yes,I have 7 of the 2nd gen and ordered this on prime day since it was a great deal.  I wasnt expect ng much but I have to admit the sound from it is day and night from the older ones.  Ill end up replacing all my older ones with the 3rd gens where they aren't wired direct or on BT to something.  If all your doing is replacing a 2nd gen that is voice control only then it might not be worth it.  The rebate on the ild ones isn't worth it so Ill prob use some of my old ones in the bathrooms and shed and under the eves on the patio.,0
4,"The jury is still out.....
  
",13.Aug.19,Yes,"While I have no complaints...other than the sound seems to amplify the lower frequencies and not a lot of mid-to-upper range frequencies...I can't give this a solid 5 star rating.  It functions as expected, the price-to-value factor is satisfactory, and it has a lot of potential (allegedly), we have not found sufficient use for it yet.  Not disappointed, but certainly not amazed either.  I can get virtually the same from Siri on my Iphone.",0
5,"Good stuff.
  
",13.Aug.19,Yes,"Works great, somewhat better sound than my gen 2 dot. Setup was an absolute breeze.  It cooperates nicely with the Echo Show in the very nearby kitchen, no voice conflicts, one always yields to the other based on things like which of them I_ closest to, or which has the necessary feature for carrying out the command.  Slightly better looking than the older model. Consistently hears me clearly.",0
5,"love it
  
",13.Aug.19,Yes,"I have the big Alexa in my kitchen and got the little echo dot for my master bath...I have the switch hooked up to my hot water recirculator and I can tell echo to turn it on or off when I need it...also nice to be able to just say ""echo, set an alarm for 6 am"" and not have to actually set an alarm clock...also, play my music when I'm showering through my echo....so many great uses",0
5,"Almost returned it!
  
",14.Aug.19,Yes,I almost returned this to seller as I wasn't able to get it to connect to my wifi. After getting an error message from the app to scan I of course called the help line. I hung up on two of the Indonesia people I talked to as the first wanted me to purchase security software for my router. BS.. The second time I told them I was going to through it away and they hu g up on me and the third time i asked for someone who could speak English. He said there all busy but he did attempt to help me which led me to going to alexa.amazon.com and syncing it up there. After a few minutes of going through the links I got it to scan. Keep in mind I did restart my router before this but not sure if that had anything to do with fixing it. Anyway go to the link above and sign in with your amazon account and try that before the Alexa App on your phone. YOU WILL HAVE TO CONNECT YOUR WIFI ON YOUR COMPUTER TO Amazon Alexa Wifi. This is not permanent it's just to get your Alexa to connect on it's own. Kinda dumb and confusing. Don't expect Alexa to play Amazon music as it wont connect if it's not a paid service from what I gather. I have a free Pandora account which one can connect from the app then Alexa will let one play music from there once you give it permission to access your account. Plan on at least an hour to get the gist on how all this is done and once you get it working you'll feel pretty good about it and you'll be saying oh that so cool! That's cool too and so on. I'm about 30 feet away from mine in a bedroom and Alexa in the kitchen and she can hear my commands. The sound is pretty decent for such a small size hockey puck. You can get some free stuff such as woof woof for your dog and have a few giggle. (through the app.)Please don't contact me on how to connect it.,10
5,"Third generation is a must buy!
  
",14.Aug.19,Yes,"Its bigger, and better then gen 1 and 2. I also own those. The speaker is on the sides so the sound is much louder. So much louder. Playing it at half is still louder then max of the other two. Gen 1 is louder then gen 2 but gen 3 is like a mini surround system. Great quality in the sound plus she has all the same features as the other two. This echo is heavier, and a bit larger. The wall charger is completely different also. A bit bigher plug then i was hoping for so I'll just be plugging it in the bottom socket. So happy I bought this. Especially since I got it on sale for just $25.00. If you already have the other generations set up this one is cake! My came ready to go and I just plughed it straight into the wall. Only had to link to my Everywhere group. I mainly use it for music but its great for games, weather, news, time, alarms, and grocery list when you cannot find a pen or paper.",0
5,"Loved the sound and variety of app integration
  
",14.Aug.19,Yes,"No doubt, alexa is still leader in voice assistance. Enormous app integration.I have 3 google mini and 2 echo dot in home with dot being the latest addition and I am loving it. Google home is good in whatever they have integration with but still many apps are not supported by them. Echo devices deserve that extra thumb for it.",1
3,"Does not play well with Samsung a smart TV
  
",14.Aug.19,Yes,The product itself works great however it does NOT like my Samsung Smart tv. Once paired w tv it worked once &amp; then audio went mute. This is a similar problem I am having w my new 4K fire stick. Once I unpaired it from my tv the audio work fine.  So buyer beware of amazon products &amp; samsung products.When I called customer service they try to blame it on the tv or my WiFi connection &amp; when u call tv service they blame it on WiFi or amazon.  It_ just not worth the headache for me &amp; my try alternative non amazon products to replace them ex. Google chrome cast or google home.,0
5,"Great Toy
  
",14.Aug.19,Yes,"I am very pleased with the Echo Dot 3rd Generation. I said that this was a great toy because other than making it simple to look up information on a phone or tablet. So far it has allowed us to be true couch potatoes since we can ask Alexa to turn on and off lights. My wallet prevents me from getting some of the products that work with Echo Dot/Alexa, but again the value isn't there for me.",0
5,"My first Echo, and ended up getting 4 more since.
  
",15.Aug.19,Yes,"So I'll start off with a pretty quick disclaimer, I had been wanting to try these for a long time, and went in with my hopes very high for the ease of use and such. I was also very worried about certain things, like voice recognition and noise, and ease of connection.I've been very pleased so far.It picks up your voice incredibly easy, I've accidently had it pick me up on 2 of the devices at once, which we fixed by adjusting the location, not its fault. As well, it has trouble with some requests, but its fine once you figure out the commands it listens for.For such a small speaker, it projects very well and sounds great, Especially once you have them all play at once and the house is filled with music. I was impressed. And as well, the volume controls are easy to adjust as well.Currently on my setup I have 4 Echo Dots, a Echo Show 5, 2 LED Lightbulbs, and 5 smart plugs, and one air conditioner, and it recognizes and controls them all very well. Its been a great addition to make light and electronic control easy and smooth.Overall, I may update if there is any significant issues that come up, but nothing that I have noticed yet, and I'm very happy with my investment.",0
5,"Really Smart device
  
",15.Aug.19,Yes,"This is my first virtual assistant Alexa device. The setup was very quick , easy and simple and did not see any issues. After completing the setup i tried to hook up to my smart enabled switch which works with Alexa that plugged to my TV.Alexa, turn on my tv in living room - Works perfectly !The only drawback i noticed is sound quality is not great compared with my google home. Also, the sound recognition is very sensitive. I was talking to my friends about this device and during the conversation, we were using ""Alexa"" word and this device turns on. Wow, it was recognizing the sound  clearly by any voice.We have made this device available to my kid to keep asking some questions, need to see how it fares up with my kid language :)",0
5,"I'm not remotely using this to it's full potential
  
",15.Aug.19,Yes,"I have these in multiple rooms in the house, and the most they get used for generally is to turn lamps on and off.  My mother had back surgery and still has trouble getting around, so this and some smart plugs lets her turn the lights in her room on and off without having to actually get to the lamps, which is difficult for her still.  I use the one in the kitchen to listen to the radio when I'm cooking, and occasionally to set a timer.  I'm sure eventually I'll do more with them, but so far I'm really not using them to their full potential, and they're still well worth it.",0
4,"Product and Delivery
  
",15.Aug.19,Yes,"When the Alexa is working, it actually works well. I use it for news, music, weather, alarm, and timer.I even order a second one during prime day. Yet, I am still waiting for my second one to be shipped to me.After several weeks, I have found that at times it does recognize what I am asking, so it just doesn't do anything. It occurs off and on, not all the time. Probably, like one day in a week. Wondering if I should consider cancelling my second order. I presume it will take another month to receive my second Alexa echo dot. By that time, I will know more and perhaps decide to return or keep the second one. I gave it a 4 star because besides the above it is overall a good product for the price.",0
5,"On the fence?
  
",15.Aug.19,Yes,"If you are on the fence about getting this device I highly encourage you to get one. I got it thinking I wouldnt use it  very much. I got smart plugs and light bulbs in addition to this. I had surgery and this has been a lifesaver! She turns off and on my lights, my fan, reminds me to take certain medications, when I have appointments, wakes me up with lights on dimmed and with music! When I get lonely she also talks to me and tells me jokes. I use it WAY more than I expected to.",0
5,"Makes life better for elderly to call or get info..
  
",15.Aug.19,Yes,Bought this to add to existing base ... in elderly mother in laws bedroom.. we have them mainly so she can just say.. Alexa call........ and can contact friends or family.. she can_ see well enough to dial a phone and can_ remember numbers.. but gives her ability to call for pleasure or in emergency..we have base in living room and this one in bedroom ..so from anywhere they can hear her voice..,0
5,"Very Impressed
  
",16.Aug.19,Yes,"I purchased a couple Echo Dots during the Prime Day deal and was so impressed with them that a bought another during a two-fer deal.The sound quality is surprisingly good so I use them most frequently for music, including asking for specific songs, that play quickly, from my Amazon Music Unlimited account.  It also integrates well with my Sirius-XM account and Tune-In.  The one trouble area is getting Echo to play specific radio stations as it has a difficult time decifering call letters.Taking it a step further, I purchased some smart plugs to work with my Echo Dots to quickly turn on various lights. I will say that I prefer using the TP-Link plugs over the Amazon brand however. This is strictly due to the fact that only the account holder can use the Amazon plugs in the Alexa App itself, while the TP-Link plugs can be made visible to your entire family in the app. I'll be checking out actual smart lights for the porch next.Overall, I'm very impressed with the Echo Dot.",2
1,"Not worth it. A piece a crap...still piss
  
",16.Aug.19,Yes,"This is piece of device Is not worth it. I had this device I couple of days I had to reset ever since. I was on the online customer service for five dam hours trying to help me  Connect the device, they weren_ help at all, not one bit. So the next day he was helpful. But could not connect to all my tv. Apparently only one tv is the main tv which  sucks. Alexa comes on in the middle of the night which again sucks, you have to tell it shut down, thank God I don_ have sleeping baby the way I was yelling at a piece of device. Tonight I come home 8/16. Ask Alexa to play so @jazz, again having trouble connecting to the WiFi... this device _UCKS  big time thank god I didn_ pay a lot of money on it. Trying to reconnect with your WiFi is hell especially from your phone. Not happy about this piece of crap. Don_ buy this crap don_ believe the  hype . I am soooooo dam  disappointed in This product, I buy lots of this from amazon but this here crap, to dam piss. On this, they just need to send me another one without me sending this one back. I have never had so much trouble of setting up anything with WiFi.",0
2,"Keep it on mic disabled!!!
  
",16.Aug.19,Yes,"So since I got my Dot I have pretty much kept it on mic disabled since Alexa responds and acts on conversations that did not include the ""Alexa"" prompt.  When it did responded, even to the ""Alexa"" prompt it responded in ways that made zero sense in terms of the context of the commands or conversations it over heard.It's too late to return this so it's mine.  The key feature I have been using this with is Amazon Music but ask it to play a certain genre and it won't play anything but the same six songs over and over and over again.The key integration I was expecting with this was home automation since the Ring Hub of my Ring Alarm (Ring is owned by Amazon) can now work as a Z-Wave hub.  However, the software still can't schedule anything yet so there is no point in moving my Z-Wave devices over to the Amazon infrastructure.  Who knows when Ring will deploy this feature?  It's been over two years as far as I can tell when the Ring community asked Ring to update the software to rotate a video feed from a Ring Doorbell 90 degrees.  This was needed in my case if I wanted to install a Ring Doorbell.  Thankfully, I was able to return the doorbell in time for a refund.I'm getting to the point of just putting the Echo Dot up on Let Go and see if anyone wants it.  It's already a sunk cost; maybe I can get some reimbursement.",0
5,"very happy with this my second unit
  
",16.Aug.19,Yes,"considering the size and cost of this unit, (I bought during Amazon Prime days) it is an amazing piece of technology.  Sound is most impressive.  Since I also have a Sirus radio, which can now be integrated into Alexa  it is even more useful.  Highly recommend.  Should have bought  two during Prime days....... UPDATE:  received item 8/7...  Worked great until about a week ago when it started skipping portions of Amazon music being played, making the unit basically useless for music purposes. Customer service said it was  a problem at Amazon's end and they are working to update codes to fix.  Said others also having same problem and may take a few days to fix.... Maybe a week or more... I'll update upon completion.....UPDATE..9/20/19  Echo working fine now, whatever Amazon did seems to have taken care of my problem.  Appreciate the good support from Amazon customer service!",0
3,"Trouble with voice setup, but sounds great
  
",16.Aug.19,Yes,"I have not been able to set up voice recognition with this unit.  It gets to the commands it wants you to repeat and then has trouble articulating them.  It stutters twice and then closes the interaction.  While you don't need this to recognize your voice to use it, it's a bit of a disappointment.One important thing though because there are a lot of negative reviews on the sound.  It sounds really good. It's the size of a hockey puck and I was very impressed with the quality of the sound that came out.  For a $25 speaker playing prime music, you'd be hard pressed to find something better.  If you are an audiophile, then perhaps you can tell the difference. For just listening to music and interacting with it, it's great.",0
5,"Better than the First Gen I have. Big improvement in sound
  
",16.Aug.19,Yes,"I'm impressed with the bigger sound. I have three other First Generation Echos and two of them are plugged into bigger AV systems so they sound fabulous, but I had one over the kitchen sink. It's More to control various Smart Home devices and occasional news and weather than to play music. I have speakers in the kitchen already running from the living room system. I really bought it to replace That one, but the power brick is too big for the recessed outlet where a clock used to be and since it's a bit wider and fatter it also doesn't fit easily into the metal holder I have on the wall overhead. So I ended up putting it in the bedroom instead, but I still love it and I'm keeping it.",0
3,"Better audio output, poor voice recognition
  
",16.Aug.19,Yes,"I use this mainly for music, news briefs, and weather reports in the bathroom. The audio quality and Max volume are definitely and upgrade over the 2nd gen Echo it replaced. The downside is that it doesn't hear me as well and I have to shout at it and repeat myself frequently, which was not the case with the old one - the second gen would hear me sometimes when I was two rooms away speaking to another device. And just today it crashed and stopped responding entirely while playing music, requiring a hard reboot.",0
5,"Bought as a gift for a friend - now I want one...
  
",16.Aug.19,Yes,"I currently own the traditional echo dot 2nd generation. However, I purchased this newer one as a gift for a friend and I am extremely jealous. The sound quality is extremely improved, its visually appealing, and overall it seems to listen better than my echo 2nd gen. The only reason I don't purchase my own is that I bought a custom speaker to go with my original dot. Otherwise, the 3rd generation echo dot is fantastic. Definitely the way to go for a smart home integration system!",0
5,"Perfect for my studio
  
",16.Aug.19,Yes,"I was looking for something that was hands-free that I could use in my painting studio... something to play music, recite the news, spit out my upcoming calendar and keep me entertained and engaged while working on my paintings. The Echo Dot has done that. Now I want one for my kitchen and the office and some accessories for turning lights on and off and perhaps a doorbell security system. I see a rabbit hole....",0
2,"Voices sounded muffled and too much bass
  
",16.Aug.19,Yes,Returned it. I use my Echo for primarily listening to guided sleep mediations for insomnia. I had the 2nd Gen Echo but wanted a clearer and louder speaker. I am disappointed in the 3rd Gen. The sounds are muffled and voices are garbled. I can turn it up louder but it just makes it worse. Too much bass.I actually have better quality sound from my Iphone. Maybe I got a defective dot. Not impressed.,0
5,"Definitely recommend
  
",16.Aug.19,Yes,"I actually am a big fan of this product. I already had an Echo in my main living space and this was a great addition to have in my bedroom. At night I love being able to set alarms I forgot to set without opening my eyes, or ask Alexa to remind me of something...two things that used to make me get up. Also I have a smart light connected in my bedroom and it_ wonderful to have the ability to shut it off as I_ going to bed with voice commands. I play all my podcasts from it, so it_ given me to ability to have my phone far away from me when I try to go to sleep! The only negative is I wish the volume options were a little more customizable. Sometimes I want to go 3 1/2! Haha",0
4,"Wish it would work with Pandora
  
",16.Aug.19,Yes,"We got this as a gift, and it's actually much cooler than I thought it would be.  Most people don't need one of these, but it's fun and novel.... a fun luxury item.  Alexa understands us very well,  much better than any other voice recognition I've used.  It does a lot of useful things, as well as fun things.  We have not been able to get it to work with my husband's Pandora account,  is my only complaint.",0
5,"Great little Speaker
  
",16.Aug.19,Yes,Alexa is the main reason I got an echo dot which works way better than Siri on my HomePod. She actually recognizes my transcriptions. After I adjusted my privacy settings I felt more secure about the transcription reviews. Don_ expect the echo to completely blow out of the water sound wise however it has a good sound for the size of the speaker. You can also connect it to other echo speakers as well which would provide a more powerful sound. I have bought a second to run some of my smart stuff in the house and I find it super convenient and the price wasn_ bad either.,0
4,"Amazon following apple's path...
  
",17.Aug.19,Yes,"Seconds update: (you can read my first at the end)Ok, I've tried the other major brand that dispute this world with Alexa, and I'm back, when I start the Google Mini I have the impression that it's very clever, he setup everything alone, I mean, wifi, but when you try to hear have nothing to compare, another flaw of the competition is the ""chains"" stupid chains, same as Alexa, the competition dont allow you to hear YouTube on multiroom, what they can but I guess need to impulse the sells of the other product like Chrome Cast, stupid things that make some users give up, but as I mention, the mini sounds like Echo 2nd gen and after hear the 3rd you really don't want to go back, and in this case I'll suck it up the inability of use multiroom with bluetooth because, like I've said, is kinda impossible you listen the 3rd and go back to how sounds the 2nd.I'm with Echo Dot since 2014, for the record, integrated with smartthings and harmony devices.Seriously,  I can't use multiroom music from my bluetooth device? Such a shame, I was thinking buy more 10 echo dots plus echo sub and echo plus but now, I'm considering send all back, YouTube,  okay, Google and Amazon dont talk each other, but bluetooth? I still not believe in that, I love how echo dot 3rd gen sounds but will be a piece of paper to me if I can't play my phone music on that, I mean, multiroom, so that's it, let's try out Google mini and see if they allow me play my bluetooth sounds as I want, also, I give up of Amazon music (such a good service) because the inability of upload my music wich I found comfort on Google play music, from my point of view, at these days that we are, you fault is inadmissible on two aspects wich makes the other brand more reliable,  so sad, because I love Alexa since the launch,  and I'm faithful since 2014, but like you following the apple paths, leaving thech behind I think is the time to change!!!",0
5,"Amazon Echo Dot is a great purchase
  
",17.Aug.19,Yes,"Here are the positives regarding the Echo Dot:  1. My wife has found that song quiz and National Geographic geo-quiz are her favorite games on the Echo device.  Nice that the device has built in game functionality.  2. The ability to have Alexa turn home lights on or off is a nice feature.  3. The ability to have Alexa integrate with home alarm system is another positive.  4.  Having the Amazon Echo Dot play music or news upon request is great.  5.  The sound quality of the Amazon Echo Dot 3rd Generation is excellent!  6.  The Echo Dot is also a great price!  We got both of ours for $24.99 a piece, a no brainer for anyone looking to buy one.As far as negatives, I don_ have have any negative info to provide.  My wife and I have had our Amazon Dots for about a month now and really enjoy them.  They are easy to setup and when I programmed in my work address it is nice to say, _lexa, how is the traffic to work? right before I step out the door to leave.  Alexa proceeds to tell me if the route to work is clear or if there are issues.",0
5,"An amazing home assistant once you become accustomed to using it
  
",17.Aug.19,Yes,"I was surprised at the ease of setup and how well it understands English spoken by anyone in range.  The speaker sound quality is surprisingly good.It took a while to become accustomed to asking Alexa for information.I suggest that the next generation of Alexa consider integrating a two-step or follow-up process when step 1 isn't successful.  For example...Today: Me: ""Alexa, define enteric."" Alexa: ""Hmmm, I don't know that word.""Future: Me: ""Alexa, define enteric."" Alexa: ""Can you help me by trying to spell some of it?"" Me: ""Sure, E N T E R...""  Alexa: ""Thanks, got it. The top definitions of enteric are...""",0
5,"A good companion!
  
",17.Aug.19,Yes,"I don't have Amazon Prime, so that automatically prevents me from accessing certain ""features,"" but this is still a welcome addition, almost like having another person around.  She (Alexa) might not know everything, but she'll let you know if she doesn't understand or just doesn't know something.  I play games with her and ask her questions, have her set alarms, watch the house when I'm gone, give me weather and scores, play music, and so much more.  For the price I paid fo the Echo Dot on Prime Day, Alexa has already returned that price to me several times over.",0
3,"Alexa Can Be Quite Annoying....
  
",17.Aug.19,Yes,"I DEFINITELY like using only one word activation, ""Alexa"", in lieu of Google's ""Ok Google"" or ""Hey Google""...... VERY ANNOYING !!!So therefore, I find myself using Alexa more for that very reason.BUTT........ she is for some reason, not NEARLY as smart when asking a question, and answering, as my Google is..... VERY ANNOYING !!!And seven microphones or not, I do not understand why she is NOT hearing me at times, with no other noise going on, AND at the same volume as I would JUST have asked something else.No matter what I do, I also cannot connect stereo sound, though they are both paired together, to listen in stereo to certain music streaming, or music on my phone...... VERY ANNOYING !!!I have yet to start really using skills, so I cannot speak much on them.I do however want to ""Drop In"", and yet it always tells me I have to give it permission, or activate, yet doing everything it says do, I can NOT find the option where it says to look for it.......

",17.Aug.19,Yes,"Purchased on sale, a bargain, practical ""toy"" that you just have to get. The sound on the 3rd generation Echo Dot is a significant improvement over the 2nd generation. Have a 2nd generation unit that was connected via Bluetooth to a large speaker. It helped the 2nd generation unit significantly. I found the 3rd generation unit performs just as well on its own without the Bluetooth speaker (freeing up my Bluetooth speaker for other use.) All other functionality is basically the same on any Echo device that does not have its own screen.",0

",17.Aug.19,Yes,"This is AWESOME for my 93 yr old mother. She has very low vision (macular degeneration for 10 years) and a little dementia. Although she first resisted this _obot in her apartment, she has embraced it a short 2 weeks or so later. Alexa now responds to mom_ _hank you, Alexa with appropriate comments, such as:  you_e welcome, or glad to help, etc. Alexa LEARNED to do this!!  There has been a learning curve, and Alexa speaks way too fast (as noted in many comments) which has been changed (8/6 or 7/2019, thanks for listening, amazon).  Especially too fast for older ears. It appears you MAY have to tell her to speed up or slow down for each time she talks. Also , it APPEARS I cannot do this on the app as a _etting.  THIS NEEDS TO BE AN ACROSS THE BOARD adjustment (not time to time) AND it Must be Adjustable from the APP. MY reason for 4 stars on sound quality is due to these comments. The actual quality of the sound seems fine. Not 100%, but fine. Bottom line: Alexa has SAVED MY LIFE and GREATLY ENHANCED my mom_ quality of life. I_e just bought Echo Connect. Hoping Connect will allow her to use her tv without having the ability to SEE the buttons.",0
5,"Very satisified.
  
",17.Aug.19,Yes,"The Echo dot is well worth the money.  It performs flawlessly and is easy to set up.  It has had no problems understanding  my commands.  The dot works with android, iPhone, and Fire tablets and phones.  I have an iPhone 6, works perfectly.  Also works with my 10"" and 8"" Fire tablets.  Setting up new devices is fairly easy.  Alexa takes you through the procedure step by step.  Would recommend.  I had the original Alexa.  The dot works just as well for a lot less money.""",0
4,"Pretty good logic, but not quite there
  
",17.Aug.19,Yes,"We got this on Prime day to see if they're worth the hype. I also wanted a way for my toddler to be able to call someone if there is an emergency. Mostly we use Alexa to play music. Occasionally I ask about weather or traffic. We've tried to ask when certain stores or restaurants are open but she can't always locate them. I'm giving 4 stars because I can't talk to her like I talk to Google and get results. Overall it's a nice little speaker to talk to, with some helpful information.",0
3,"""What song is this?""
  
",17.Aug.19,Yes,For a small speaker it sounds pretty good. The only complaint I have has to do with how the Echo and Dot can't seem to coordinate how to handle audio as a pair. When music played in both devices the system holds onto the last song's information BEFORE the group is aked to play no matter how many songs are played through a group. You can ask for a particular song and that song will play but if you then ask Alexa what song is playing the response will always be the song title last played on a single device.,0
3,"Good for weather, music
  
",17.Aug.19,Yes,Alexa responds to voice commands is good for asking simple questions weather time temperature does integrate easily with Kindle and fire stick however Alexa lacks a lot of skills that my Google Assistant can do very nicely unable to make phone calls access reminders etc I'm sure things will improve since I only paid $12 because if a prime special and a gift card I really can't complain I got my money's worth.,0

As for the voice recognition, it does not always get it right. It integrates well with Music streaming services though, and it makes listening to my favorite Radio stations in the morning easy.",0
5,"Quality speaker and satisfactory assistant
  
",18.Aug.19,Yes,"I finally had enough time to play with this to give a quality review.I am new to the world of Alexa. Most of my house is filled with google IOT merchandise.Voice recognitionThe voice recognition is good but not great. It_ reliable for most everyday tasks.Call capabilityIs an incredible feature. I have been out of the country since my purchase and haven_ been able to use it on my own device.SoundThe quality is amazing for the size of the speaker. I don_ love that the volume settings are only 1-10. I like to set my volumes by percentage... idk I_ weird but I prefer that to the numbers of Alexa. However at a 6, I_ able to hear the music well over my shower or in an adjoining room.SetupThe setup was much easier than most other IOT products. I would almost give it a 5/5 just for that. I was surprised at how easy setup was after trying to setup my fire stick (night and day difference)While I_ not sure the quality is different enough for me to switch over.. I_ glad I splurged the $25 when it was on sale to try it out.I want to see IOT get a lot bigger.... so I definitely support what amazon is doing.Let me know if this was helpful.",0
5,"Compared to echo gen 1, it's MILES better!
  
",18.Aug.19,Yes,"I use my Echo Dot primarily while I'm in the shower to check the time, weather, and play trivia games like Jeopardy. Echo gen 1, I felt the volume wasn't quite loud enough or clear enough to understand all the words in the trivia questions. I usually had to have it repeated once or twice. This Echo, it's not a problem! Maybe one repeat per 12 questions. Also, this Echo's understanding of my answer is WAY BETTER! Over 30 days of usage, I think she misunderstood me once or twice, playing every day. I know there are bigger problems in the world, but it was still frustrating to know the right answer, only to get it wrong because she thought I said something else. I would recommend this gen Echo 100% :)Also, my 9 year old son listens to Prime music while he is in the shower. I asked him if he thinks this generation is better, and I got a resounding YAASSSSS!I  hope this helps anyone thinking of upgrading!",0
1,"Great when it actually works
  
",18.Aug.19,Yes,"Stopped playing music from any of my 5 linked accounts. I did a factory reset, linked and unlinked the accounts and the echo Dot still says ""I'm having trouble playing music"". It's been two weeks and still no fix, I might have to switch to Google ___. *Update* Customer service called and pointed me to ""Technical Support"" which then proceeded to troubleshoot and perform everything I had previously done. Then one of the agents left the chat and another joined, had to wait for that agent to get up to speed to what we were doing. I did another factory reset and tried everything the agent suggested. Long story short, my device is no longer under warranty and they can only offer 15% discount on a new one since all troubleshooting has been done and they have no clue what is wrong with the device.",0
5,"Alexa. Is pretty cool. ..
  
",18.Aug.19,Yes,I'm so happy that we made this purchase. I'm still learning what (she) can do. The initial hook up wad a little complicated for me. But after a while I was ablessed to hook it up to the stereo and tv. And now I can turn it on with a voice command. My 5 year old grandgranddaughter loves (her). And I've actually learned of more skills that alexa can do. From her. Such as ..Have a conversation. My only negative hit on this product is that on our 2nd night. We played a song from amazon prime music. That was pretty loud. And we didn't know how to stop the song. So alexa ended up getting the speaker popped and has a crackle every time (she) speaks. I'm hoping amazon can help me with this. Overall I highly recommend this product. I want more._. .lol,0
5,"Convenient and useful
  
",18.Aug.19,Yes,"I bought this because the radio in the kitchen was getting difficult to reach due to back problems.  Now, simple voice commands get me the radio station or information I want.  I had problems setting it up using my phone and my tablet, but the laptop worked well.  It does not always give you what you want, however.  I asked it to play ""Who's on first?"" and it started playing some odd music and then offered me an Audible subscription.  After I said ""no,"" it played one of the intros to my request, but stopped after three seconds.  I'll try again.Other than that, I consider it a good investment.",0
1,"Stops responding - Doesn't Work With Pandora
  
",18.Aug.19,Yes,"The Echo Dot intermittently stops responding to commands. It also stops playing Pandora in the middle of songs on a regular basis (1-3 times every 5 minutes). Customer service tells me that their technical support people have been working on the Pandora problem for a long time and have not been able to fix the problem. For me, the Echo has turned out to be a waste of money.",1
5,"You need Alexa in your life
  
",18.Aug.19,Yes,The dots seem to hear me better than my echo show. The sound quality isn_ the best if you want to play your music loud but for usual everyday conversation with her it_ perfect. I have one in every bedroom of my house and in the living room. Definitely a helpful gadget to have and all the different apps and stuff available now are a lot of fun. Amazon even sends me periodic emails about new stuff Alexa can do so there_ always something new to try.,0
5,"It_ a fun item
  
",18.Aug.19,Yes,"This is my first experience with an echo type device and I like it. I_ not so tech savvy that I can automate my entire home, but Alexa has her value. She is a great quick source of information like the weather, which NFL teams are playing, what certain terms mean, and so forth. Alexa also has a bit of humor in her AI whining find refreshing. I_e read the stories about hackers listening in but the echo can be turned off thus eliminating this potential threat.",0
3,"Something to Think About
  
",19.Aug.19,Yes,"Alexa technology is great as well all know who have seen one. You can play music in the nursery by saying "" Alexa play ambient music"". You can set a reminder, you can use it as an alarm clock, you can leave love messages for your partner when you aren't home, and you can ask her questions rather than logging in to ask google or siri a question HOWEVER you should be weary of this technology... she's always listening recording conversations in your home and uploading it to a cloud database. She is a machine with too much power over your life. Locking your doors, turning on lights, computers, and other electronics in your home. I don't know about your concerns about government intrusions but do your research before buying one and bringing one of these into your home. If you already have one unplug her when not in use.",1
3,"Unpredictable
  
",19.Aug.19,Yes,"I mostly listen to talk radio, and that's working well on this device. I also use it as an alarm and a timer. Thumbs up on those.HOWEVER, the ambient noise function for sleep is terrible! I actually prefer brown noise, and it starts off great. But then, it shuts off after less than an hour, no matter how long I set it for. Telling it to loop worked once or twice, then never again. I read that telling it to set timer for X amount of hours would work. And it did...ONCE. Last time I used it, it shut off after 20 - 30 minutes, and I told it to reset 8 times! Anyone who sleeps with ambient noise knows that it interrupts sleep if it stops. My research on how to solve that problem showed many other such complaints. So annoying!Also, Alexa subscribed me to the monthly Amazon Music subscription without my permission. Thank God I caught it soon after it happened. Customer service canceled it and told me how to disable it.I'd actually give it 3.5 stars for these reasons, but that isn't one of the optiions, so I gave it a 3. Fix the ambient noise option and I will give it 4.5 stars!",0
5,"Improved since the last generation
  
",19.Aug.19,Yes,"I bought this dot to sit in a small food trailer. The last generation dot had a very tin can sound to it. This next generation is a great improvement. It doesn't have the quality of an Echo, but it really is a pretty acceptable small speaker. The quality of the speaker, in general, has improved. The last generation seemed to be made of cheap plastic. Still plastic, but much improved in the quality and appearance. Great for audiobooks and background music.",1
5,"Amazing
  
",19.Aug.19,Yes,"I love this speaker so much.  I debated getting one for well over a year but now that I have it, Alexa is one of my favorite things in the house.  Very helpful, especially with things like reminders and alarms.  I got this as a Prime Day deal so it was much cheaper than normal.  The only thing I don't like is that it's white-ish in color.  I really wanted a black one but when I went to order it the black was all sold out apparently so this was my only option.  Honestly, that's my only issue with it at all is that I wish it was the black model, but I'm ok with this one for sure.",0
5,"Very useful!  Installed easily!
  
",19.Aug.19,Yes,"At least the two Echo Dots I bought recognize my wifi.  They were easy to set up, and I am loving Alexa's list making.  What a help!  And I don't have to bother looking up and reading any notifications.  She reminds me by her green light and reads them to me.  Part of that includes letting me know about the Amazon shipments I am getting that day, and again when it has arrived.  Great product !  Now if I can just get the Ring 2 doorbell to work with Alexa....guess I will try again tomorrow.",0
5,"Very pleased
  
",19.Aug.19,Yes,"I received a 2nd generation Echo device as a gift and decided to get an updated one. This one has better sound quality than the previous one and is ideal for listening to music. I have this one in the living room and use It throughout the day for reminders, timers, music, games, and more. I put the other one n my bedroom and use it to listen to sleep sounds and for the alarm, mostly. I_e been trying to get multi room music to work for me but it is frustrating. Overall, I love the Echo device and am glad I bought it.",0
4,"Beware of refurbish echo dot 3rd gen
  
",19.Aug.19,Yes,"I finally got an echo dot 3rd gen that is working great.  The 2 previous dot gens stopped working in lest that 2 weeks. I ordered the echo show 2nd gen and echo dot 3rd gen in July during the sale days. The first one broke down after 2 weeks. I got a replacement in a timely manner, next day. After one day the second one broke wouldn't work, wouldn't respond to commands and the light  would randomly change colors.I had some suspicions about the dots. I spoke to a supervisor and asked if the dots were refurbished, I was told yes.  The supervisor said another one would be sent out next day. I asked if it would be a refurbish one, supervisor said it could be and there was no  way to know if I would get a new one.The supervisor suggested I buy a new one to ensure I would not get a refurbish one.  I had to buy it, but would be reimbursed.There must be some quality control problems on so-called certified refurnish products.Be sure to asked if you ever have to return a new purchase, will it be a new one or refurbish.",0
5,"My husbands shot reminder
  
",19.Aug.19,Yes,"There are so many good things I can review about our Echo dot.  We enjoy listening to the music we request, if we are stuck on trying to figure a question that is asked of us, Alexa knows.  If we need to know what the weather will be we just ask Alexa.  The most important feature is the reminder.  My husband is a diabetic and has to have 2 shots a day.  He always remembers the morning shot but forgets the evening.  With peace of mind Alexa reminds us every day at five that it_ my husbands time for his shot.",1
5,"Convenient to have..
  
",19.Aug.19,Yes,I like having Alexa in my kitchen ask her anything and she tries her best to answer you. I mainly listen to music of my time just call out a song and she will try to find it also get Amazon music it gives you a better selection Don't know about her listening to every word we say and logging that but who cares.. the end days are here and you can't stop what's about to happen..,0
4,"Seems like a good choice so far
  
",19.Aug.19,Yes,"I_l admit it, this was an impulse buy. But once I downloaded the correct app (make sure not to get anything other than the Amazon Alexa App) the setup was easy and took very little time. So far so good, and I may start integrating other things to the device very soon. It_ living up to its reputation and I look forward to seeing how I up using it.",0
5,"Great for the Absent-Minded! Changed my life!
  
",20.Aug.19,Yes,"It sounds wierd to say Alexa/Echo Dot changed my life, but let me tell you how it has helped.I am absent-minded, and I have no sense of the passage of time.  Quite often I'd forget to start dinner until 7PM, and since I am on a special diet, that meant eating later than optimal.  I also take medication several times a day.  Add to that how the day can simply get away from me, and I was feeling frustrated with myself! I had no one to blame but myself, but the thing was -- blame wasn't helping!  So I got a dot.  I started putting in reminders for meds, for starting dinner, for remembering to switch the laundry to the dryer.  I got more done, and it helped me not get into negative self-talk/self-recrimination for my forgetfullness.  If I had to stop mid-task, I told Alexa to tell me in 5 minutes.  I used to really get off track if I went to the bathroom and forgot what I was doing before that.  Well, now things flow better. I dont get annoyed with myself, I just fix the reminders!  I don't use alarms anymore with their blaring noise -- if you are a forgetful or absent-minded person like me, an alarm is an annoying noise and youo still might not remember what it is FOR.  Alexa just tells me.  I am also free of the million-zillion post-it notes and the lists that always seemed to be in the wrong room.  Alexa keeps all my lists, and can read them to me.  I set up Google calendar, let Alexa have access and now she also can remind me what events are coming up --- be that doctors or social events.  Finally I have a flow to my day that isnt disrupted if I chase down some internet research topic or read a little longer than planned.  Alexa helps me keep things from falling off my radar, and I dont have to use a form of mild shame to motivate myself.I wish I had tried it much sooner.  My husband was so amazed, he bought the 2nd one for me!  He now enjoys having Alexa play sports talk radio and news, and fun stuff like jeapardy questions.  I've started to listen to audiobooks more and my imagination is soaring.  Alexa is a great addition to my life, the personal assistant I needed!",3
5,"Big punch in a little package
  
",20.Aug.19,Yes,"First off, I'm extremely impressed with the new gen 3 echo dot. I was gifted the Gen 1 years ago (which I still use), however, was lucky enough to receive two gen 3 eco dots as promotional _ifts? during other Ring security device purchases.Initially, I was not impressed, considering the gen 1 I already owned was kind of garbage. However, planned to use the g3 as a doorbell chime speaker. Nice amazon offer considering Ring doorbells aren_ compatible with nearly any other preexisting products; also had zero intention on spending at least $60 more to be alerted if someone was at the door..Pros: The speakers on the G3 are extremely impressive, blows my gen 1 out of the water. The ever-growing list of compatible devices are a surprising fun bonus (i-robot, nest, ring, Samsung anything, xbox, Philips, random water and electric companies etc.). The voice recognition is better than my gen 1 for whatever reason. For example, asking random questions (what's the weather) the Gen 3 will respond/understand, gen 1 (will either completely misinterpret what I said and or doesn_ know the answer).  When you download the Alexa app on a mobile, you can also connect to eco remotely, obviously for when you need to play some music for your dogs during your absence.I'm not sure why there's such inconsistency between the (gen 1 and gen 3), both up to date and on the same network etc.Cons: inconsistencies with the different gen_ software responses, makes me question how other echo devices will function and for how long. My experience with attempting to add and use the _kills (essentially apps you need to download to pair with Alexa compatible devices), was pretty bad and extremely frustrating. When I initially was trying to set up the _ing skill, they showed bound but not communicating., was directed to Ring pairing directions on Amazon, those directions said to go to the Ring website which included instructions for how to pair with Alexa/echo, i.e. back again to the Amazon directions site I conveniently just came from, wash and repeat.Take away: This is a great device and you should probably buy it.",0
5,"Easy to set up.
  
",20.Aug.19,Yes,"I love my echo.  I use it to turn my bedroom light on and off, listen to music and other miscellaneous things.  Each night I read and when I get ready to turn my light off, I purchased the smart plug to do this, and I don't have to climb out of bed to do that.  Just tell Alexa to do it and it's done.  The sound is great and clear.  I can't compare it to earlier versions because this is the first one I have had.  Call it lazy, but when you have bad knees and feet this is a lifesaver.  My granddaughter loves to ask it questions and hear the answers she will give you.  I done a lot of reviewing and studying before making my purchase but I am so glad I did buy it.",0
5,"Fun for the whole family!
  
",20.Aug.19,Yes,"Easy to set up if you have experience with pairing devices and using your cell phone e.g Amazon Alexa and Smart Life.  Fun for the whole family!  I was shocked at the amount of cool features the echo dot with Alexa has!  The trivia games are great fun to bring everyone together and I would have to say my favorite feature, being in a large home, is the ability to broadcast messages to any echo dot that is connected to your home network.  The echo dot with Alexa is a great feature to our home and it is kid friendly.  My daughter asks Alexa to play, ""Jesus loves me"" every morning.  I will definitely be buying a few more echo dots to fill other rooms in the home.  Nice sounding speaker even at max volume, Good voice recognition, and a great number of different options and ability this little device has to offer.  Good buy!",0
1,"I have tried numerous Echo devises and none have worked well.
  
",20.Aug.19,Yes,This was my last ditch effort trying Echo devices. This one heard me wrong often and had a lot of trouble connecting to the latest Samsung soundbar. The biggest downfall was it kept loosing the Wifi signal. I have been using the similar Google device for a month or so now and sorry to say it works much better.,1
1,"Stopped working around 6 month mark
  
",20.Aug.19,Yes,"Be aware this item only has a 90 day warranty. Nothing out of the ordinary with it's usage and well equipped to handle basic IT troubleshooting. My device was defective after the warranty ended but within 6 months of usage. Connected to internet just fine, power fine, but zero sound coming out of the speaker. Completely useless. Invest in something better.**EditAmazon was able to help me purchase a new device (making an exception to their 90 day warranty) and this time I did purchase the $8 extended care package. I still am wary of the quality of the product. You have to spend $8 extra to protect your $30 purchase. Oh well.For something so cheap you'd think Amazon would be more willing to swap out lemons, but I got little to no help from customer service. The most basic troubleshooting that is null/void on a defective device. 90 days is all you get and then the support stops there.",0
5,"A MUST have in our home!
  
",21.Aug.19,Yes,"Every since purchasing our first echo dot, it has become a must have in our home. This device will make your life easier. One of my favorite things about the echo, (aside from being able to control almost everything in my home..with just a single voice command.) is being able to tell Alexa what to put on my grocery list. She will immediately send your list to your Alexa app. Another very handy feature, is the guard feature. Alexa will guard your home and send you an instant notification if it hears any glass breaking, fire alarms, etc.. you can check in on your home with just a click of a button. If your purchasing an echo dot, I definitely recommend buying a few smart plugs. They are well worth the money spent. They allow you to control devices from the alexa app, that aren_ smart devices. I definitely recommend this product. I bought the sandstone colored one, and it looks incredible in my home.",0
2,"Aux Out Only - Useless for me
  
",21.Aug.19,Yes,"This is an excellent device for using as a smart speaker, but I wanted to use it in my classroom as a speaker for my projector/laptop. I purchased this device because I am very impressed by the quality of my other Echo speaker at home, and I wanted a smaller version for my classroom. When I hooked it up with the auxiliary cable... nothing. Since there were students waiting, I tried a couple of other things to no avail; but finally just gave up and brought it home to investigate further. After nearly an hour searching videos on YouTube, reading articles online, and 30 minutes with Amazon customer service over the phone; it turns out that only the Echo Dot 2nd Gen has the capability to have Aux In. The Aux port on the 3rd Gen (which I have) only has the option for Aux Out. Great speaker, but totally defeated the purpose of my purchase. I'm sure it says somewhere that this is a feature, but I have used my other Echo device in the same way and it worked. You know what they say about assumptions...",0
4,"Great product and sound
  
",21.Aug.19,Yes,"We use this every day. Sound is great and voice recognition works as expected.  If you have 2 devices nearby you can rename the echo dot to ""Echo"" or ""Computer"" rather than ""Alexa"" to wake it up. Nice feature.  Integrates fairly well with our Sonos One although the devices get confused when streaming Amazon music. i.e. I tell Alexa on my Sonos to ""play songs by..."" and it will play a song then stop.  I have to go to the app, tell it to stream on a particular device/room then it does it's thing.  I also haven't figure out yet how to add my Sonos and Echo Dot to play the same station (i.e. can't assign them to a room).  Great product overall but doesn't play well with others :)",0
5,"Fascinating device!
  
",21.Aug.19,Yes,"We received this as a gift and are just now beginning to appreciate some of its many functions.  We plan to buy some smart lights and cameras.  Right now, we are just playing with it.  But it's an extremely useful device.  I wish the speaker was a little bit better, but it can be integrated with a better sound system.  I'm playing music from my phone through it at it works great!",0
4,"Excellent Addition to our Household
  
",22.Aug.19,Yes,"I live in a townhouse with an open  kitchen/living room area. We keep Alexa hanging from a wallmount (highly recommended to minimize wires and space) in the living room. I love that I can tell her to add things to different ""lists"" I've created while I'm cooking, straightening up, watching TV, etc. Super convenient to then access my lists (grocery store, dollar store, pet store, etc) when I'm out and about. Much easier than keeping track of all the scraps of paper I used to carry around in my purse.I know about the privacy concerns and couldn't care less. If someone is listening in on my conversations, then I feel sorry for them. I know my life is boring, so to listen in on my boring life must be just painful.Downside: My husband and I have been spooked more than once. When talking, she'll butt in our conversation with some pretty creepy comments - even when we haven't said a word that even slightly resembles her name. More than a little disturbing. But hey, we're living in a sci-fi book now, so there's bound to be some troubles, right?",0

Thanks tech support!Alexa is great by itself, but since I purchased Echo Dot to pair with my original Alexa, I find myself shouting and still not getting a response.

",22.Aug.19,Yes,"We bought it on a very good sale for our boys room. They_e thrilled with it. For our purposes, it_ a glorified version of the alarm clock/ radio that I got excited about when I was their age. It has great sound for a bedroom- but I_ not super picky. We like how you can program it to say reminders at different times, or I can call it from my phone anywhere. The boys like the jokes and puns- we do have Amazon music- so that makes it better.

",23.Aug.19,Yes,"We now have five Amazon Dots throughout the house, not counting the ones that belong to the kids.  Not all are 3rd Gens (yet), I updated three with the new 3rd Gen. because the sound quality is so much better and I love the convenience of listening to my playlists and books on them.  I think they also respond better.  I am so spoiled by the benefits and features of this technology that I would hate to go back to life without it.I start my day with a ""good morning"" to Alexa, which in turn usually gifts me with a laugh and/or a bit of trivia.  After providing me with the weather and a little news I usually request a playlist to enjoy during the rest of my morning routine.  My dots remind me of my appointments, to take the trash cans down to the street, to take my medication, and to pickup after the dogs before the yard service arrives. (these messages will also display on my cell phone and tablets)  At the end of the day, after I'm in bed, I look forward to having ""Alexa"" turn my fan on and my light off.  Then ""Alexa,"" on one of my new 3rd Gens, plays my ""bedtime"" playlist until I fall asleep.P.S. I'm 70 years old and wish the Amazon Dot would have been around 50 years ago.",0

I bought it as a but if fun, but it has turned out to be a great little hub in the family. Morning times are great listening to some coffee time jazz over breakfast. What a great way to start the day! Then Alexa dampens my day by announcing that it_ going to rain! Haha! If you can get past the initial set up and syncing with other devices, then your home and dry. It can be very tricky to start with, but remember this piece of kit is growing technology so don_ expect it to start baking cakes for you just yet?

My wife purchased the unit over my objections and one for her mother also.However, after a time having the device in my home and with all the features Alexa offers and commands she recognizes I don't know how I got along without her.  I had my doubts at first but no longer.  I am very satisfied with Alexa and I would honestly miss having her. Please note that this not an attempt to get you to buy one. It's just my honest take on the question ask of me on of what I think of Alexa now that I have one..",0

It beeps during the night, creepy.2. Not smart enough. For example, when I say ""play a song"", it starts playing whatever is left off on spotify. I sometimes listen to a podcast on Spotify, it just continues playing the podcast! Come on, that is not a song!3. The alexa app is really slow ands stupid. For example, the settings page always return to top when you click return. Also not able to change to a male voice, not able to change the tone or the speed of alexa vioce. Comparing to the google home mini I have at home, this app is a piece of sh*t.. Every click I make somewhere in the app, I have to wait about half a second to a second. (iPhone Xs, latest iOS). Come on, amazon iOS developers, you can do much better than this.4. some other small things I couldn't remember now.Pros:1. skills alexa can learn, like integrate with many news sources, even though it is not many though.",0
5,"Enjoy The Echo Dot
  
",23.Aug.19,Yes,"One thing I dislike is that the first app I found by searching the App Store turned out to be the wrong app. But I couldn't set up the Echo Dot until I committed to one of their payment plans. The lowest level was a trial period of 3 days, then $12.99 a month. The next level was $29.95 for a year, which I selected. But then I still couldn't get the Echo synced with the Firestick, or even to reply to commands. I didn't realize, my wife already had the correct app because she was already set up with another Echo we purchased a while back. When I realized the app doesn't cost anything I felt like I had been mislead.Other than that, we enjoy having our second Echo Dot.",0
5,"Watch out for scam iphone apps for alexa!!
  
",23.Aug.19,Yes,"This is a great smart speaker with great sound. The quality is better than google home mini. I have 2 google smart speakers (1 regular, 1 mini) and I have been happy with them, but I wanted the guard and burglar deterrent features which google so far does not have. I believe setting up various music applications (spotify, tunein, pandora) is easier on the echo dot. Right now these miracle workers are on sale for $29 which is quite a bargain and I would recommend them to all technophiles. Watch out for iphone apps to set this device up (Setting Up Alexa, etc.) -- some are demanding money and don't add anything to the device. Amazon should not allow these apps to be sold on Apple store (don't know if they exist on google store). The ONLY app that you need is ""Amazon music"" which is created by Amazon, not some scammer. Note Amazon does not demand money to add skills (at least music, burglar deterrent, guard), so if your app asks for money (Prime), then you have downloaded an app which is a scam.",0
4,"A bit heavy on the bass and light on the treble; replaces my Echo Dot 2nd Gen.
  
",23.Aug.19,Yes,"The bass was strong, and the treble was weak, probably because of the shielding from the grippers of the wall mount.  But, I didn't want to fool around drilling holes to let more treble out, as others had mentioned.  I did, however, adjust the tone from the Alexa app as much as possible.  This is mounted in the bathroom of the master bedroom and paired with an Echo in the bedroom.  That way, when I must use the bathroom, I get continuity of programing. (Sorry, I'm just a privileged geek.). This rig replaces a similar one with an Echo Dot 2nd generation.",0
3,"She's good but..
  
",23.Aug.19,Yes,already purchased Prime and the Echo now I have to also purchase unlimited just to listen to regular music? Like that's entirely too much so I choose to connect to apple music. SO even though Alexa is going through MY apple music account for some reason she cant find some of my songs which I think ridiculous because when I ask her to play a playlist the songs play without issue. I just feel as though she is great if you listen to mainstream music but really when she connects to my apple music through my account she should be able to access all of the songs saved to my library without issue.,0
5,"What did I do before Alexa?
  
",23.Aug.19,Yes,What did I like?  I found Alexa to be a great help several days ago.  I was sewing and impaled my finger with the needle.  I was alone and could not reach the tools I needed to free myself.  I used Alexa to call my son and she saved the day.  I don_ advise getting rid of your life alert but she sure helped me in a pinch!  I love being able to listen to books on audible.  By far it is a very useful help for many aspects of daily living.  I now own 3 and have no regrets.  Set up was easy enough for me. (old lady),0
5,"Fun and incredibly handy!
  
",23.Aug.19,Yes,"Love this cool little dot!  Easy setup and easier to use. I call on Alexa most often for music, so will probably end up ordering a larger speaker or two, but it is so handy to think of a song and tell Alexa to play and it starts. I love the reminders and get a kick out of the super fun interactive games and animal sounds.Still trying to figure out how to control my Fire TV stick with the Echo dot vs the stick remote.",0
5,"Alexa tell me that you love me!
  
",23.Aug.19,Yes,"Where would we be without Alexa?I bought two, one in the bedroom and one in the living room.  I_ so happy with them.  Small, discrete and perfect for me.  One of my gentlemen friends said it doesn_ have enough bass, but he ended up being a tool so whatever.  It is a tiny speaker, you cannot expect it to have the acoustics of the Mann Music Center.  I used them all day long every day...I think they are great.",0
5,"It's worth upgrading.
  
",23.Aug.19,Yes,"This echo is much louder than the second generation. I bought this as a back up to my second generation echo. I got curious about the volume level after reading a review. I have to it better than my second gen. I retired my second gen echo to the garage and put this one in the bathroom. Its louder and clearer, and can be heard in the shower with the shower going. And I got it for $22. During Amazon week!! Win... Win",0
3,"Slow response time
  
",23.Aug.19,Yes,"I have two Echos at the moment. The first one I purchased was refurbished and it works perfectly. I purchased this Echo brand new and am a little disappointed. The refurbished one I have has superior performance. This one is disappointing because there is a very slow response time. I have made a command and have waiting up to 10 seconds for a response. Also, this echo has also stopped playing my music randomly without a command. Sometimes I have to repeat the wake word 2 times before I get a response.  I don't know if I received a defective one, but this has been my experience.",0
4,"Identical to Gen. 2 Dot, But with Handy Display
  
",24.Aug.19,Yes,"This is a nicer-looking, Gen 3 update of the original Dot with be better (but not stellar) sound.It only comes in the sandstone (light gray) exterior, though I would rather have had a charcoal/black finish, so it would match my watch/iPhone/AirPods dock.The key new feature is the four digit display, which seems to magically float behind the material skin.While seemingly a simple addition, the display is actually quite handy.First, it serves as a clock, which is great bedside, as I previously had to bump the nightstand so my Apple Watch display would come on to see the time. Now this Dot serves as an always-on clock. Also nice, it automatically dims or brightens based on the room lighting. On the lowest brightness in a dark bedroom, I think it gives off no more light than the power light  on the Apple dock, while keeping the display readable. During the day, it brightens as needed to match the room. Good engineering! You can also turn this off and set the brightness manually.Another benefit of the display is showing you the volume whenever you press the volume buttons or even if you ask to turn up the volume. Or ask the temperature and you will see it on the display, in addition to hearing Alexa tell you.There are more uses you will find, but I_e found the display more helpful than I expected.Now, whether you want a smart device on your nightstand is another question. If you happen to have a wife named Alexa, I definitely wouldn_ locate an Alexa-enabled device bedside, at least not without changing the code word (think about it!). Many folks are uneasy about the whole smart device concept so YMMV.But, if you like smart speakers and the Alexa echo-system, I think you will find this Dot a helpful addition.I took off one star because I do think the price premium is a bit steep over the regular Dot, but if you keep your eyes open, you can at least get it at a discount of $10 off for $35. Instead of the usual $45.",0
4,"Flawed, but better than my GEN 1
  
",24.Aug.19,Yes,"SO much better than the early access GEN 1 version I bought in 2015 lol.It really has bass and is quite loud!I had my old one plugged into my home theatre system via the mini cable. It drove sound well. This GEN 3 does NOT PUSH as much audio power as my old one. No idea why. It even uses more power. Previously volume 7 was loud enough to hear over tv and AC window unit. Now it_ gotta be 9 to hear and 11 to really play music.My voice is bad due to an accident years ago leaving my vocal cords scarred. Annoyingly, I_ STILL having to do training, but it STILL isn_ as good a listener as my old one which I gave to my best friends kids to use.Pros:Very decent speaker quality.Doesn_ use mini usb for power.Doesn_ slide around like old ones.Cons:Doesn_ drive enough via external audio.Microphone seems less responsive.",0
5,"Good Smart Speaker
  
",24.Aug.19,Yes,"Bough 4 of these for work.  What?  Yeah, 4 for work.  Our phone system does not have an intercom function and you can use these as an intercom by ""dropping in"" on one of the speakers.  You can have  a 2 way conversation and that's pretty handy.  The sound quality is pretty good as well.  I am a died in the wool apple user and fell out of my chair when I found this integrates with Apple Music.  I have another brand of smart speaker at home and now wish I could trade them for echos.  I'm in the process of getting a few more of these to put in other offices on a different floor to see how well I can communicate with them.The only thing that makes it difficult to set up is NOTHING!  Easy set up and if you are going to use these as intercoms, you have to set them all up using the same account.  Not that big of a deal for me or where I work.I really like these things!",0
5,"Wonderful timekeeper
  
",24.Aug.19,Yes,"When I received the Echo Dot as a gift, I didn't know what it was, what it did, or how I should make it do it.  I needed a couple hours of tech support to activate Alexa using my PC because I have no mobile devices.  Sounds like a bad review, right?  No!  I love the Echo Dot!  I don't have a newspaper, TV, or radio so I never knew the weather forecast.  Now I can ask Alexa for today's weather or next Sunday's weather.  I also use it to set timers.  I have so many projects that I need to watch the time carefully for each one.  Now I can set multiple timers to keep me on track.The best feature is the ability to set reminders days in advance.  I can say, ""Set a reminder for Tuesday at 5:30 p.m. to do the laundry.""  Friday night I plan my weekend and set reminders for the entire weekend.  It's amazing.  I get so much more done because I stay on schedule.My friend visited with three of her children to look at things on the internet.  I didn't know how to keep the 6-year-old and 12-year-old boys occupied, but Alexa saved the day.  I activated the skill Tune In Live which lets you listen to any sporting event for $2.99 a month.  The Phillies happened to be playing.  The boys were so excited to listen to the game live and ask Alexa questions during the commercials.There are so many more skills that I've barely scratched the surface.  Wiki How is another great skill.  I was hesitant to introduce more technology into my home, but Alexa is so helpful.  I'm happy to have the Echo Dot and recommend it for timekeeping, education, and weather and news updates.",0
5,"Love the new look
  
",24.Aug.19,Yes,"I'm Alexa'fied"". She is everywhere in my house. The new Dot looks great. The sound is improved some, but still not on a par of course with an Echo Show or dedicated speaker. I use my Show in the bedroom as a stereo pair with the new dot. Gives you an all around the room sound.The one thing I am curious about is that my earlier generation Dots get into a conversation with me. I can say, Alexa what time is it, she tells me, and then I say, ""How is the weather?"" and she tells me, and sometimes on the end of a string of conversation I say, ""Thank you"" and she says, ""Anytime"". I notice the light ring on this new third generation goes out immediately after responding to the first command/request. I'm wondering if there is a setting that allows it to make conversations like my other earlier versions do.",0
1,"A reminder set on 1 Echo Dot does not broadcast to all Echo Dots.
  
",24.Aug.19,Yes,"I bought my first 3rd gen Echo Dot about 8 months ago, as I recall. I mainly use it for reminders. I live in a large home and therefore often could not hear the reminder. I recently bought 2 more to spread around my home. Unfortunately, a reminder placed on 1 Echo Dot does not broadcast to other Echo Dots making it rather useless.In addition, I know it has other functions. I do not know what they are or how to set them up.In summary, the devices are like 3 bricks to me.",1
5,"Like the old Echo Dot with surprisingly rich sound quality
  
",24.Aug.19,Yes,"The new 3rd gen echo dot packs a surprising amount of quality in a small package for a great price.  I definitely recommend it for anyone who liked the functionality of the Echo Dot 2nd gen but felt its speakers were not adequate.  As with all Echos, the voice recognition works great with a male voice, but Alexa seems to not really understand women as easily.  Still good and entirely usable, but occasionally frustrating for my wife.  Also, the fact that you cannot link two accounts to your echo network is frustrating.  My account has all the smart home stuff configured, but my wife's has all the music associated to it.  I don't see why Amazon is reluctant to allow us to link those accounts when we live at the same address...",0
5,"Echo Dot, Where Have You Been All My Life?
  
",24.Aug.19,Yes,"I received an Echo Spot as a gift,  then 2 smart plugs, and then purchased the Dot.  What a system!  After the initial setup of the Spot, the rest basically set themselves up.  At my age, I thought it would be hard to get the components to work together, but the technology is very user friendly, even for seniors like myself.  Bedroom lamps turn off with a couple of words.  Coffee comes on in the AM when I tell it to.  The Dot is a cute, little item that sits on the counter, answers questions, adjusts its own volume, turn things on and off,  plays music, and basically makes life easier.  I definitely plan on adding additional Echo Dots!!  Very Senior friendly.",0
5,"Only minor complaints, more capable than Google Assistant
  
",24.Aug.19,Yes,"Excellent microphone, it picks me up from across the room.  Speaker nice quality, even works well as a Bluetooth speaker.  I do have trouble distinguishing been fifty and sixty when hearing the weather report.  When Alexa misunderstands she is often too eager to play music instead of answer a question.  When she answers a question it's usually the right you, if not the correct answer.  For example it take several tries to get from her what direction the wind is blowing, but every answer send to also include the days high and low temperature.",0
5,"Smoogle what?
  
",24.Aug.19,Yes,"I have two of the other products and the quantity went to poo after a week. I was hesitant about the echo based on the other home /nest products but so happy with my decision to take a chance and go with. Works seamlessly with my nest thermostat,  ring doorbell, smarthome smart plug, and ADT. OMG, I love this thing. Sound quality is great. Understands my statements and questions throughout the room. Wish I had one in every room and I want to pick up Alexa products to replace the other substandard products.  My wifi isn't awesome but holds up and the echo doesnt complain. Love it",0
5,"Spend the few extra dollars and get the 3rd Generation Dot!
  
",24.Aug.19,Yes,"If you are like me and have the 2nd generation dot then you know the speaker is ""lacking"" the microphone is temperamental and let's face it there is going to come a point where the 2nd gen Dot just won't support some of the new things Amazon is adding to the Echo's. The 3rd generation Dot sounds a ton better, its clearer, louder and has multiple microphones built in so it can understand you a lot better. I replaced my 2nd gen Dot's on Prime Day 2019 and couldn't be happier!",0
5,"Alexa provides good sound quality once you get to know her.
  
",24.Aug.19,Yes,"The major drawback with Alexa is a lack of documentation with the Dot.  Repeated directions to ""go to your APP"" are worthless when you do not have the APP yet and are trying to get the thing to work.  Once installed and working, depending upon your provider's service quality, Alexa offers simple and effective access to music and information with very good quality sound, whether I place it on the arm of my recliner or on a hard wood surface.  It is certainly worth the discounted Amazon price.",0
5,"Completed my Amazon environment
  
",24.Aug.19,Yes,I received a Amazon Show for Christmas and loved it.  I rounded out that purchase with two other echo dots that have been a marvelous edition to my home.  I am able to sync all three devices and have great multi room sound.  I have named them all different wake up names so I can distinguish which unit to pick up the command. Excellent alarm clock and data retriever.  Excellent addition to my Bedroom and Living Room.,0
5,"Third generation dot offers so many improvements!!
  
",24.Aug.19,Yes,We bought this dot for my daughter_ room. She mainly uses it to check the weather each day for school. She also turns on and off her light because we paired it with a Smart Plug. She also sets an alarm on it for each morning. The third generation sounds so much better too! I have a first generation dot that I use for talk radio because music sounds terrible out of it. The third generation speaker is leaps and bounds better!!,0
1,"Nope
  
",24.Aug.19,Yes,"I have two that work great but this one won'tr stay connected to the internet at all.And when trying to reset it, it won't give me the Wifi to log into, so its basically a paper weight at this point.",1

",24.Aug.19,Yes,"I purchased the dot for several reasons and now own 3. I have dysautonomia and can use this to get help if I need to do so. It can can for people, text and I even thought if I need to call 911, it can probably be done. I check the weather, makes shopping lists and set reminders. I also use it to play K-Love radio while I_ getting ready in the morning.",0
5,"Good deal.
  
",25.Aug.19,Yes,"Definitely plays music well, as long as you aren't too worried about amazing sound quality. For the size of the speaker, it's prettty awesome.Alexa is very helpful, we use her to set timers for TV/Computer time limits, cooking. I have a reminder to take my vitamins set in, which is excellent since I am always forgetting. Every day she helps me remember things. We have a grocery list set up, so I can add items to the grocery list as I use them, which helps us keep from running out of essentials. If I see something is low, like the peanut butter, I simply say 'Alexa, add peanut butter to grocery list' and it's there. If I have already added, she lets me know and asks if I need to add it again. You can access the lists in real time from the app on your cell phone, so if my husband stops on his way home from work, he can see everything we need right in the store, and check it off the list as he picks it up.As long as you don't mind the marketing that comes along with being listened to constantly, it's great. (Husband and I discussed getting oil for our new house in the kitchen and immediately after I had an ad for an oil company on Instagram. Could have also been our phones. Hard to tell what is triggering these events anymore nowadays.)We also got one for the kids to have in their playroom and they love it. I know there are more features that I can access for them. I just have to find a good description of what they are.One drawback is that you can only link one music service account (that I can tell). Amazon music will only play on one speaker at a time for me, so if the kids ask for a song downstairs, my music stops upstairs. We have gotten around this (upstairs adults) by listening to another app, like iHeartRadio's generic radio stations (since you can't log in and customize likes/stations to multiple music services that I can tell), or TuneIn will play public radio by asking for the program automatically.",0
5,"A great buy
  
",25.Aug.19,Yes,"I got 3 of these on Amazon prime day due to the discount, as I was not sure I'd really use it to be paying full price.  However, it has been really useful.  We have one in each of 3 rooms, and my husband and I both use them.  The ability to turn on and off lights (with the smart plug) is useful, and the ability to play music.  We've used the timers, reminders, drop ins, and asked random questions that we would have usually had to go to the PC to look up. We've also had fun asking Alexa the random things that some of the emails suggested.  All in all, a great buy. I will probably be purchasing one more in the future.",0
4,"Getting better
  
",25.Aug.19,Yes,"I have a 1st gen Dot and got this new 3rd gen bundled with a refurbed Show on Prime Day, and I was pleased with how much better the sound is in the new one.  It certainly isn't the Echo or Show, but it isn't nearly as tinny as the 1st gen Dot.  This one in in my bedroom and I use it mainly for an alarm and to play some kind of audio as I fall asleep and this Dot more than fills the bill.  I love my Alexas, they are in just about every room in the house (if they listen in, they are really in need of lives), most connected to nice speakers so my music plays all through the house on my Everywhere network.  Wait for a sale and buy multiples, you'll wonder how you got along without them.",0
5,"Loud and clear!
  
",25.Aug.19,Yes,"I now have 3 Echo Dots (2 are 3rd gen) and an Echo Show 5. I also have a competing system that starts with a G. In almost every way, the other system comes up short. I love the drop in feature. I can drop in on my garage and listen, plus it makes a great intercom, something the other system lacks completely right now. Amazon, you came up with a real winner and I'm a total convert! And yes, I did start with the other system and still will use parts of it for now, but like this one better.",0
5,"Not bad at all!
  
",25.Aug.19,Yes,"Great for a single, full-range, down-firing speaker. Their circuitry has it bass-heavy, so in settings, increase the miss up 2 &amp; highs up 4 or max.

My toddler even uses  the Echo Dot even though he requires a little help with the recognition aspect, which is quite entertaining for the rest of us.

",26.Aug.19,Yes,"I purchased this item on Amazon Prime day with a prime account for a reduced price and it told over 3 weeks to arrive.  This is the 3rd dot I have purchased and as with all the other Alexa devices (5 total), they set up easily and work consistently without problems.  The sound is ok and good enough on the Dot for casual listening.  The Echo Plus is much better. All the Alexa devices do not hear very well when playing music or in a room with the TV on.  Even with no background music, she often misunderstands activity requests and I have to repeat the command phrase.  Plus, Alexa is not very smart - she can answer only a fraction of the questions that Google can.",0

",26.Aug.19,Yes,"So I have had Fire TV devices for years and this Prime day I decided it was time to automate the home. I got smart plugs and the Echo and some Echo dots and started to study how it all integrates and works together. The Echo can do more than I will ever need and it works perfectly as long as I don't mumble my words. Now that it controls all my lights,TV,thermostat, wakes me up, keeps my various lists and on and on and seems to know all the answers to my questions I am one happy camper. With the Alexa App I can add or subtract skills and customize my privacy.  The sound quality is very good a big surprise for the size",0

1,"3rd Gen is TRASH - Don't buy this!
  
",27.Aug.19,Yes,"I purchased three of these during Prime Days.  First, it took FOREVER for me to receive them, and I still have not received one of the three ordered.Secondly, the only music platform that seems to work correctly is Amazon music.  On any other platform, the song gets about a quarter of the way to halfway finished and it cuts out to dead air.  When the music resumes, a new song is playing.  I listen to pandora primarily, then apple music and Amazon as my last option.  I purchased them to add easily accessible music in my office, gym, and yoga room.  I contacted amazon and did troubleshooting with no resolution.  They sent me two replacements that are doing the same thing.  The funny thing is if I listen to my second-generation dots and plus I have no issues with any of my music platforms.  It is only the third-generation with the problem; which tells me there is something wrong with this third-generation.  I hope they will take this back and return my money.  I would rather have a refurbished second-generation than not to be able to listen to all of my music platforms.Thirdly, the echo says it is up to date, BUT the tech support representative stated that the software version is not the latest.Lastly, I have to repeat myself multiple times for this echo to wake up and do what is asked.  In my opinion, Amazon had to throw a bunch together to keep up with demand from Prime Days and manufactured a bunch of defective echo dots.I hardly ever do reviews, but I am so annoyed with this situation that I had to let others know what to expect.  This third-generation is not the high-quality Amazon product you have become accustomed.  Do yourself a favor and wait until a new generation becomes available or buy an old one.",2

",27.Aug.19,Yes,"The sound quality is mostly good, but it_ surprisingly hard to control the volume. If I change it on my phone via the app, sometimes it just randomly changes back to whatever it wants. If I change it by pushing the button on the echo dot it tends to stay there, but then it_ just kind of a pain to have to walk back to change it again. There_ a HUGE discrepancy between song volume and commercial volume on some of the amazon free music stations, and with some of the skills (notably some of the quiz/family game type skills). Alexa understands me 95% of the time, and the other 5% of the time seems like she_ having a small stroke and comes up with bizarre responses or skills. Regardless, I still really want another to add upstairs, and also an echo plus...",0
5,"Having fun!
  
",27.Aug.19,Yes,"Received my first dot for Mother's Day and bought a second one during Prime Day.  I also bought the wall outlets that go with it and use Alexa to turn the lamps on and off.  Not rocket science, but good to know I can do this do this using the Dot or using Alexa app on my cell phone when I'm not home.  I also like listening to music or my latest audiobook while I do other things.  It's great for making a shopping list.  As I use things during the week I just tell Alexa to add it to my shopping list.  I print the list when I'm ready to go to the store.  Has made shopping much easier and I'm not forgetting to pick up ???  I also like making/receiving phone calls on it.  Great range for voice pick-up and hearing others.  My grandchildren have fun listening to jokes, asking funny questions and listening to their music.  I find it's easy to use and the sound is good for it's price range",0

Not only is there static, but they often miss commands.When playing a group, there's issues every single day.I honestly would avoid these devices.They seem to have a mind of their own when it comes to streaming music-I have Amazon Music and am about ready to cancel it.Customer service tells me to power cycle and factory reset, shut down WiFi ect.This is ANNOYING because it has become a weekly process.",0
5,"A Great Assistant for the blind
  
",27.Aug.19,Yes,"This was a second dot for my home. The first I received as a gift. I loved it so much I bought a second one. Echo dots are great. You can place an order, look up information, get latest news &amp; weather, set up reminders, listen to music, etc. It_ like having a computer you talk to. It makes a great gift. A legally blind friend is able to get anything we can get on a computer just by talking. What a great piece of technology!",0
4,"Good Purchase Overall
  
",27.Aug.19,Yes,"Was very easy to set up and easy to use right off the bat. As Alexa is still learning, she doesn't always recognize a command. When playing games through the device, it never lets you stop the game no matter how many comands you tell her to stop and I either have to press the Alexa button on the top and have even had to unplug the device a few times for her to stop what she's doing. Overall it has come in handy and it gets better each day. Just needs to learn to stop certain skills/processes when asked too.",0
4,"Perfect for listening to music
  
",28.Aug.19,Yes,"I mainly use this for listening to music or nursery rhymes for my kids. My husband has an accent and it doesn't always recognize his voice, or will play the wrong thing when he talks to it. I am happy I purchased it though, but a few things can be improved. I have it hooked up to my Spotify and Alexa will always try to play from Amazon Music first. If it isn't available, it will go into a paragraph explanation on trying to get me to get another subscription to Amazon Music, etc and is really annoying. The other annoying thing is that it is constantly flashing yellow. I've disabled notifications from the Alexa app for this device, yet it still beeps and flashes every time I have a package delivered or something has shipped. I had to move it to a spot where it can't be seen because the light bothered me so much. If they can fix that issue, I'll give it 5 stars.",0
1,"Terrible customer service experience
  
",28.Aug.19,Yes,"David Josue was my customer service chatbot / person.  I own multiple Echo device including an echo, FIreTV, several dots throughout my house.  They all work great except one of the new 3rd generation Dots recently purchased.  That new Dot drops my music streams around 8-10 times per hour, sometimes more...sometimes every song...and has done it right from the start.So what do I do?  I go online to request an exchange for a new functional Dot.  The system FORCES me to chat or speak on the phone with a customer service rep.  Okay, irritating, especially when I could have simply opted to return the item for a refund, and then buying another new one to accomplish this same task.  But, I'll do it.Over 2 hours later, after chatting with David through this time, I've provided lots of ridiculous info, router make and model, distance from router, other device info, etc., some of which may be relevant, but also including a DNA sample (kidding), and get this - approving his request for an Amazon rep to conduct a house visit to gather debug info from the Dot....?!?!?  Seriously, for a $30 device?!  I say ""sure!"" because at this point, I think they make this process as long and drawn out to dissuade people from getting this done...what else am I to think?  What would you think?So, David concludes by saying this will take several days to have the development team triage my data and get back to me via email about next steps...Meanwhile my device dropped the stream 11 times in a little over an hour while chatting with David.  He wraps our chat session by asking if he has addressed all my concerns and questions.  I tell him, well, ""No, not satisfactorily, but you know that don't you David?""  He responds -""Perfect! Have a great evening.""So now, I'm all in to see how utterly absurd this process will be to exchange the Dot for one that functions properly.  It goes without saying that I will not be recommending Echo devices to anyone and will be regaling them with the request for a home visit by Amazon before honoring the exchange request.  I seriously doubt anyone, including you kind readers, will believe it!  But, it's true.  I swear on my dog's life.So, what will come next??  I don't know but am waiting in awe of this stupidity and will update as it goes....UPDATE:  the second Dot that came in the order with the first one is now also dropping pandora streams, so it'll be a return for both, especially since I've not received the aforementioned email from the development team wanting to swing by the house for a debug and beer session.  I guess I'm done buying Echo devices until they work this out.",0
5,"Much nice and better quality Echo (than the original)
  
",28.Aug.19,Yes,"I bought a few more echos on Prime Day as they had a great day (only $22).  I already had one echo which I ended up giving to my parents in law.  I liked the original echo so I figured I would try the new version and I am not at all disappointed.  These echos are better than the original in terms of both voice recognition and speaker quality, not to mention they look way better too.  When I talk to these echos, they understand my voice much better and I usually don't need to repeat myself.",0
5,"A little mighty Echo
  
",28.Aug.19,Yes,"These Echoes are small but versatility and convenient. A nice feature is that with 2 of them you can link them as stereo speakers (just for streaming music services). I got one for free as part of a bundle with Echo Show 5 and bought the second one for less than $25 so it was a great deal. With echo dot it can fill my whole house with it's audio. It is a small device but you will be satisfied with the volume. Plus Alexa is so friendly. LOL! You can ask for the weather, play with your favorite music actually there's a lot to discover what Alexa can do in a very fun and exciting way, she can even tell a joke!",0
5,"Love the functionality!
  
",28.Aug.19,Yes,"Love the Echo Dot!  Currently only have 2 in my home but will probably get more later.  In my opinion, the sound is good and her voice clear.  I basically use mine for weather, occasional music and to turn lights on and off.  So glad I finally took the first steps toward a smart home by buying these dots.  Would definitely recommend to all.  If you check Amazon_ main page, you sometimes can find the dot for $20.00 off( for a limited time).  Well worth the purchase!",0
5,"Alexa rules!
  
",28.Aug.19,Yes,"I love the convenience the echo dot gives.  I talk to her all day, and she's really smart!  She helps me stay organized and I love the fact that I can be hands free with my lights and my speakers.  Not that being tethered to my cell phone is that much of a hassle, but I still like this better.  Of note, though:  Alexa does not swear.  She tells me to ""Clean your BEEP house you BEEP"".  I think it's funny, most people won't.  :)",0
1,"Not worth the stress repeating yourself.
  
",28.Aug.19,Yes,"Turns off randomly, doesn_ respond. Says it_ working but clearly no music comes out. It does what it wants and I_ dissatisfied with buying two. I_ throwing all three away since amazon does not want to help me resolve these issues. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON FRUSTRATING SPEAKERS",1
4,"Works great with Hue light bulbs
  
",28.Aug.19,Yes,"I bought an Echo Dot after seeing my sister's during a visit. It looked like fun. In reality, it has been very useful. I have a couple of hanging lamps with cords but no inline switches, and using the Echo Dot with the Hue light bulbs, it's easy for me to turn the lights on and off or dim them at any level. I also use it as an alarm clock and timer. I'm sure I've barely skimmed the surface of what it can do.",0
5,"Amazing
  
",28.Aug.19,Yes,"So easy to set up. Works instantly, no programming or waiting.  Built in speaker sounds great.  Lots of bass.  Range to activate is great.  I love this thing! I mostly use it for reminders and playing music.  Also use it for weather report and sometimes to ask generic questions like ""what is the largest land mammal?"" Would highly recommend.  Bought for a steal on Amazon for $29.99. Well worth more.",0

",29.Aug.19,Yes,"I bought two of these: one for me and one for my parents. Mine won_ go through all the prompts to learn my voice (I was sent a replacement and experienced the same issue with the second), but there is a ticket out to the developers to research the issue. The customer service representative has gone above and beyond to try to help me; he even called my internet provider on my behalf. My mom_ Echo Dot learns voices easily but she can_ drop in using her phone (iPhone SE). I_ able to do it on my phone (iPhone XR) so maybe her phone is just too old.My father has health issues and the Echo Dot makes me feel better when he is left alone for short periods of time. My mother has security cameras, so if he is to fall and can_ get to a phone, she can send an announcement to him through the Echo Dot. Also, he is losing his eyesight so he can ask Alexa what time it is and what the weather is like outside.When you receive your Echo Dot, one of the first things you should do is have Alexa check for software updates. Also, be sure you keep the Alexa app up to date.",0
4,"Great add on Alexa for rooms where you don't listen to much music
  
",29.Aug.19,Yes,Personal Experience:This was a give away during Amazon prime day and I placed it in my basement where my kids like to play.  The Alexa integration is great and it was an easy add on because I already had an Alexa account setup.  The only negative is that this unit is not the best at playing music compared with the bigger units.  Because this was an add on for Amazon Prime Day I'm not saying I'm disappointed with the product due to the way I received it; but I would not purchase this for a room I plan on listening music in.  Otherwise this is a nice drop and go Alexa device for rooms that you want to add Smart Home features too.  Something people should also be aware of is that this unit can be changed to a kids setting rather than buying the Echo Dot Kids Version.Recommend:YesPros:Easy to set upSmall form factorSmart Home FeaturesInterface is easy enough that my toddlers understand itCons:Not the best sound for music in larger gathering rooms like Living Room,0
3,"Disappointing voice recognition
  
",29.Aug.19,Yes,"Sound is much improved from the original Dot, but sound detection is very poor.  I can face directly at this Dot from about 12 feet away, give an Alexa command, and a different Echo will respond.  Usually my older, original Echo Show - around the corner and another 15 feet away in the Entry - will respond.  Occasionally, my new Echo Show - behind me in the Kitchen about 15 feet and facing the opposite direction - will respond.  To get this 3rd generation Dot to respond, you must either shout or stand about 3 feet away facing directly at it with your back to other Echo units.  This Dot was very inexpensive on Prime Day and it sounds great when played as part of an Echo group; otherwise, I would have sent it back.  (In addition, there is the entertainment value.  My wife gets a good laugh when I try to get this 3rd Gen Dot to do something).",0
5,"Great help with day to day activities
  
",29.Aug.19,Yes,"Having Alexa has made my life easier. It (She?) does everything from reminding me daily to take my meds to assisting with shopping and shopping lists. We converse on everything from the nature of the universe to answering questions like can cows swim. People ask, aren't you afraid of ""them"" listening? I answer, I'm not doing or saying anything ""they"" can't hear. There is no secret subversive spy stuff going on in my house, so no, if anything ""they"" probably think we're pretty silly in my household. We play games, run appliances, listen to music, news and ambiance sounds and generally have fun with Alexa. She's become an extension of the house and at times is hilarious. Only occasionally will she give me some off the wall answer that makes me think she tapped into secret government projects (like her answer to my question what's in retinol cream - she gave me answer sounding like she was describing a retina screen) and the men in black will be showing up at my door soon. But all in all I'm thoroughly enjoying my Echo, the sound quality is great and setup and operation are a snap.",0
3,"Buggy and not all that bright
  
",29.Aug.19,Yes,"The speaker sustem works well enough, but Alexa has serious bugs and has trouble answering even simple questions.Example:  Ask Alexa to play music in a certain room. If music in already playing anywhere else, she will tell you that and ask if you want to play music where you requested.  YES, THAT'S WHY I ASKED!Example:  If you ever turn on the explicit music filter, it cannot be turned off.  Alexa will tell you it's off, but if you then request she play a song, she'll tell you she can't because the filter in on.  ARGH!Example:  If you request to play music using the app, it will always respond that there are no Alexa devices connected to the internet.  Wow, really?  I have 6 connected!Amazon tech support was no help fixing any of these issues.",0

",29.Aug.19,Yes,"I have now gone Alexa all the way! The 3rd edition is an absolutely amazing addition to the Alexa Plus.It is way better than the original edition because it has a drastic difference with audio quality due to the wrap around improved speaker.I love the option to be able communicate with different rooms by using the _rop In option.  Also, the set up is extremely easy but does need the WiFi.  I have now set up a routine to say _ood night and have my lamp turn off.  Or, _ood morning which I set up to have my lamp come on at 75%, and give me the days forecast.Catching up on the special price of $29.99 was an absolute steal.

",29.Aug.19,Yes,"So I bought alexa because I felt a little lazy getting up to turn the fan on while sleeping and turning on the fairy lights that's in a hard to reach place(behind a crib). I'm also currently using her as a speaker for my laptop because one of the speaker is broken. I love the sound that comes out of it! It's a very neat gadget that has so many use to it! I'm also planning to buy an Alexa compatible thermostat and robotic vacuum. I like that one of the review mentioned they used an old bath and body works candle holder.. went to go buy one, but of course they have seasonal things so I picked one with larger holes so that the cord could be inserted. Fits the Alexa third gen perfectly with tiny gaps in between!",0
5,"We love our new Echoes!
  
",29.Aug.19,Yes,"Being a prime member allowed us to get several of these little gadget/smart speaker/doodads (technical term) at roughly $20 apiece on Prime Day was pretty fantastic.  The voice recognition has been great as Alexa doesn_ take commands from our pets or guests.  There so much I_ still learning that Alexa needs to get to know us more and that I need to learn more of what she can do, making calls, scheduling, playing music, but thus far, I cannot change the gadget_ name, which is the only negative.  I would really like to have the option to change its voice to sound like that of a surfer and call it, _ude, which would be totally righteous.",0
5,"The hardware is good, but the software needs a bit of improvement.
  
",29.Aug.19,Yes,"This was purchased as an upgrade for the first generation Alexa.  Overall, much better for the same cost.The sound quality and volume increased significantly,  but it has trouble when communicating with Bluetooth speakers.  It can send them from quiet to loud skipping the mid range of comfort.  Yes, the Bluetooth speaker works just fine with other devices.Also, it has trouble responding when you choose it_ name to be Echo, but not with the other (pre-programmed) names.  I think it is because _cho is two syllables and the others are three.  I would really like it if I could choose its name, so that my conversations with I would be more fluid.",0
5,"Functions well--easy setup...
  
",29.Aug.19,Yes,"I'm well past 60, and I had no trouble setting this up.  I ask for the weather forecast, time to travel ""from"" and ""to"" areas, and playing music.  I really like that it can be given an alternate wake-up name (as we have a 10"" Kindle that responds to voice).  I purchased this as a package with a smart plug--and the two work well together.  Again, I had it set up in just minutes.  Really liking this device--and the potential for more devices and smart devices in the future.",0

5,"Easy to use and get used to having around.
  
",30.Aug.19,Yes,"First of all, I bought 5 of these little assistants. They are wonderful and I find new capabilities every day. Sometimes by accident. They are easy to set up if you follow directions. I set up mine from an Apple laptop because my iPhone 5 is not compatible. Once I figured that out, it was easy. Once you set up a ""dot"" you can unplug and move anywhere you would like one. I have one upstairs (bedrooms), two on the main level (kitchen, family room) and two downstairs (den, bar). So I'm covered no matter where I am in the house. Its function as a timer is great. From pill-taking to wound dressing to cooking all you have to do is ask. Music is everywhere - one dot or all dots - your choice. Extremely good quality as I walk around the house. You can ask a million questions and get an answer immediately. Unlike Siri, Alexa has no sense of humor at all. Ask her a silly question and she will ignore you. Smart approach I guess.  I just wish I had enough time to learn to use more features. The next function will be to integrate with ""Ring"" security systems and integrate with my thermostats so I don't have to do up and downstairs to reset them. All in all, ""Dot"" is an 11 out of 10 (not a typo). BUY them, don't hesitate.",0
1,"Crap crap crap will return
  
",30.Aug.19,Yes,"This is a piece of crap! Editing my review here. Well, I was able to get it connected and was able to add my Pandora to it. I asked Alexa to play one of my stations on it and it did start playing. However every single song that played, the Alexa did not play any of the songs in its entirety. It would just stop playing the song and jump to next one. This went on for at least 45 minutes and then it stopped playing altogether! It stopped just like that. This isnt good. For one, when I want to listen to songs I want to be able to listen to all of it. Plus, my plan was to use this in my massage sessions. It_ bad enough the device decides to stop on its own and not play the songs in their entirety while I_ listening but this would be embarrassing for it to do this me while I_ massaging a client.That being said, looks like I_ still going to have to return all of them. So yeah, it still deserves a one star in my book. Sorry Amazon but I_ going to get a Google Home.",0
5,"Much louder than 2nd generation!
  
",30.Aug.19,Yes,"Sometimes I have to call Alexa twice to get her attention. But when I have it she works flawlessly. I also have a second generation. Now, I live in a rest home and I have a room to myself approximately 15 x 12. And having two dots in such a small area could be confusing. It's like sometimes the third generation will wait patiently to see if the second generation will pipe in. Other times the third generation uses Brute Force to over come the older second generation. One thing you instantly notice is that the third generation is about 3 times louder then the second generation with much more Bass. Almost too much. But it is all good! I cannot cook the 3rd generation and 2nd generation together in the stereo configuration. I don't know if it's them are just the neophyte like me trying it.  I can't see any reason to buy more of them in the small room and since it's a rest home I'll probably spend the rest of my life here anyway. Just the same it is so cool to have Alexa right there when I need her.",0

I get my daily ""flash briefing"" news, ask for the day's weather report every morning to help me decide how to dress that day, enjoy listening to TED Talks and NPR radio live while I'm cooking, and music while I'm relaxing. (To get a huge variety of music selections, it helps to be a member of Amazon Prime.). But I find it most useful when I have a question; I no longer have to go to an encyclopedia or type my request on the computer.  I can just say, ""Alexa, spell (put in a word).""

1,"Alexa Dot does not work on my mesh WiFi network
  
",31.Aug.19,Yes,"Amazon the on-line retailer is best of breed.  But the Alexa Dot uncovers a weakness in their technology offerings.  Out of the box, the two Dots I purchased looked handsome.  Both were configured to my network easily.  This was done with the units in the same room.  I wanted to use the Dot's broadcast feature and my initial tests showed that it worked between the Dots.  I then moved one unit to another room out of earshot.  The broadcast feature did not work!  Amazon Customer Service was contacted and after 15 minutes of diagnosis, the broadcast feature still did not work.  The Amazon Agent confirmed a known defect in the Dots: they will not connect to each other on a mesh network system for purposes of the broadcast feature.  Very odd.",3
3,"Works ok, sounds terrible...
  
",31.Aug.19,Yes,"This works just like any other Alexa type device and does an OK job of not knowing what you're talking about unless it's weather or music, but we're all pretty used to that. The three star rating is for the speaker. It sounds terrible. My daughter has a similar one and it too sounds horrible The speaker is muffled and has no high frequencies. I've asked Alexa to ""Turn up the treble"" and ""Turn down the Bass"" and she appears to do it. Doesn't help a bit.To get an idea of how the speaker may sound if you are thinking of buying one, remove a mono speaker from an old pickup truck (something from the early 60s), hook up some wires from a cheap stereo, wrap it up tightly in a small towel, insert the speaker and towel in a large Ziploc bag, and drop the entire thing into a 5 gallon bucket of water. Note that the truck speaker will sound slightly better but you'll get the idea. The strange thing is the Echo's speaker actually will sound decent if you hold it in your hand with the bottom facing out. This doesn't work if you place it upside down on a surface (I tried all sorts of different surfaces), only if you hold it in your hand. If you just want to hear Alexa's voice the built in speaker will suffice. But if you would like to listen to music on your Echo you should order an external speaker to go with it or prepare to be disappointed.",1

",31.Aug.19,Yes,"This is update since Amazon took off my negative reviewthe speaker blew out after 7 months and now it doesn't detect my voice as well as it used to.  It is frustrating if I have to buy one every few months. The warranty is only 3 months so they must think it will only last that long.It might be worth getting Google Home since the quality of the product seems to degrade over time.Update:Amazon called me to replace my product and they just made everything worse. They promised to replace my item and then did a bait and switch and tried to sell me the same product at 20% off.  That's unethical.1. Amazon called me to replace the product.2. Amazon system went down and the representive couldn't replace my item. They made notes of our conversation and told me to call back.3. The new rep who was an overseas customer service center read the notes and told me they couldn't replace my item...they only offered a discount.4. I spent 2.5 hours with as they told me that they were unable to replce my item only to check their recorded calls and agree they had made a mistakeSo basically they called me to tell me to replace my item only to keep me on the phone for 2.5 hours trying to sell me their defective product again. Instead of replacing a $30 device that cost $3 to make they just lost a loyal customer. That's bad basiness, I'll buy Google products instead",0

I_e grown completely frustrated with this ufo looking thing my sister swore would simplify my life! So far I am thoroughly disappointed! I am trying one more thing to strengthen WiFi even though all other devices work fine. But after that. I give up on you Alexa. Sorry gal ya gotta go.UPDATE: So while out shopping I received a phone call from Amazon. Reluctant to speak based on the unknown number, the woman was funny with her tiny hello. She was calling about my previous 1 star review! =O Holy Moly customer service! Later I was sent an email to follow a link for help with my misguided Alexa. After many trials, errors, laughs, a 45 ish minute wait for another update, another friendly call back at the time promised by Customer Service, Alexa can stay! Thank you!",0
4,"My first Echo ...won't be the last.
  
",31.Aug.19,Yes,This is my first Echo and first experience with the Alexa technology in my home. I bought it to pair with a LIFX smart bulb and it works great. I've learned to create reminders and routine. I like making lists that are available on my Galaxy smart phone also. I have created routines and still learning new things.  I plan to buy another Echo--the larger Gen 2 with a better speaker to play music but will still use this Echo Dot for many tasks.  Echo Dot does not have excellent sound -- and that's why 4 stars and not 5 -- but I am 100% satisfied with it's functionality and that it is an inexpensive introduction to the Alexa wifi virtual assistant technology that I intend to expand in my home.,0
5,"From Gen 2 to Gen 3..
  
",31.Aug.19,Yes,"This Gen 3 Echo Dot is awesome! The sound is so much deeper and full. The Amazon Alexa app even has equalizer. This Dot makes a perfect device for  office, kitchen or bedroom listening. I definitely recommend this for someone who wants a compact listening device with an option for aux plug from a media device. However,  you can connect via bluetooth so not sure you'd use the aux plug(maybe for an iPod). Cool feature in the Alexa app, you can set your devices to home or away. In the event of loud glass breaking it will alert you. Neat idea! Overall for the sale price of $29.99 (previously $19.99 on Prime Day) this is a great buy. Fun for all ages.",0
5,"LOVE THIS ALEXIA
  
",31.Aug.19,Yes,"I already have an Alexia Gen 2, which I love. I use her for everything but she's at the other end of the house, so I put this ""oatmeal"" colored Gen 3 Alexia.  This one feels like heavy cotton, feels much heavier and sturdier than the Gen 2. The speaker is bigger so I think the music is louder.  I love both of them. Would buy this Alexia again.  Very well put together and craftsmanship is really great!!!  Love the color too, instead of just hockey puck black.",0
5,"Echo dot is almost as good as the Echo 2nd Generaton
  
",1.Sep.19,Yes,"I purchased the Echo Dot 3rd Generation on Amazon Prime Day Deals.  I could not pass this deal up with the Amazon Smart Plug included.  I was pleasantly surprised at the sound quality, volume of this Echo Dot.  I do not remember the previous version of the Dot but this is very much improved over the previous versions.  I wanted another Echo for my powder room but did want to pay the price for another Echo.  Music sounds great on this little device.  Perhaps I am using this in a small powder room but it sounds almost quite as good as my Echo Second Generation.  It was easy to connect, easier than my second Echo, and it is small.  I understand it is larger than the previous Echo Dots but I dot notremember what the size of the previous  version was. Even though it's larger than the original Echo Dot, it is still very small.  If you would like a smart speaker and can not afford the Echo, buy this you will not be disappointed.  I like the idea that you can buy a wall adapter to hang it up on the wall by just plugging the Dot into adapter.  It will be out of the way.  Check for deals,as this can be had for a very affordable price.",0
5,"Love It
  
",1.Sep.19,Yes,"Purchased two of these for two different rooms.  Also purchased smart outlet plugs to automate the house.  My original intent was to buy one of these to control the garage door opener after purchasing a WIFI module for the opener, but it turns out there is an additional fee from the garage door opener company to link to Alexa which I am not willing to pay a yearly fee to add the functionality.  Mainly use this to check the weather and trigger sequences to turn on and off various things in the house.  The kids seem to think it is fun to make Alexa tell jokes or sing songs.  Will have a good time discovering additional features.  Sound is amazing for such a small device, loud, and lots of bass (surprisingly).  Would purchase again.  Love the fact it gives me notifications on my Prime purchases.",0

3,"Didn't listen while playing music on decent volume
  
",1.Sep.19,Yes,"When the song is playing on a volume greater than 6 it does not listen it's name ""Alexa"". Finally has to use hardware volume buttons. Setting up my voice profile was a big trouble it keeps getting stuck _ in between. Cannot play songs on YouTube. One day I asked to play songs by the artist Sanam Puri and it played some bhangra song from an old Bollywood movie. So frustrated with it's performance. I have a Google home mini which works perfectly fine in all these cases. I bought this Alexa to gift it to my father but now I don't think hw will be able to use this device _. I have to gift him Google home mini instead.I hope Amazon will improve it's conversational AI and send the update so that it would be worth using it.",1
4,"Only real complaint is Voice Recognition
  
",1.Sep.19,Yes,"As a whole I love the Alexa product line. Before buying any Echo Dots, which at the time the 2nd generation was the most recent version, I had read reviews about how great the voice recognition was and how the dot would pick up the users commands even with the TV on etc. This has not been my experience, both with the 2nd gen and 3rd gen. I was hoping the 3rd gen would be better.  I mainly only use Alexa for security and smart home functionality with the Ring skill and the voice recognition is my only real complaint with the product. My living room, dining room and kitchen area is a mostly open floor plan and approx. 1200 sq. ft. and I've tried all kinds of configurations with the goal being me being able to speak at my normal voice level or even slightly louder with the TV on and no matter where I am at and Alexa picking me up the first time and I have not been able to achieve this or really even close to it. Sometimes I have to almost yell. I have the dots plugged directly into outlets using 3rd party holders as I'm a minimalist and like to keep the clutter to a minimum. I have 4, all 3rd gen, and they are spaced pretty evenly apart. I don't have the TV off very much when I'm at home but I believe voice recognition is not an issue when its turned off even if i dropped it down to only 1 or 2 dots.",0
2,"2 out of 3 Echo Dots quite playing music
  
",1.Sep.19,Yes,"I've worked with customer support on the problem with my 2nd Echo Dot(3rd generation).  The problem is when playing music it will stop mid song after a couple of minutes, wait 30 seconds and then start playing a totally new song.  I've done everything customer support told me and nothing changed.  My 1st Echo Dot does not have this problem  Finally decided to replace the 2nd Echo Dot with a new one.  The new one came and had the same exact problem.  Tried everything I did with customer service and still no resolution.  These Echo Dots were my initial test for deciding what platform to use for smart home devices in my new house.  While the first Echo Dot works great, the fact that these latest two do not work and customer support has no resolution leaves me thinking that Amazon may not be in my future new house.",0
5,"Easy for an older person to set up
  
",1.Sep.19,Yes,I admit that I was intimidated at the thought of setting up the Echo Dot (3rd Gen) - Smart speaker with Alexa by myself.  I normally have one of my children come set up things for me.  I followed the directions and had the Echo dot set up in no time at all.  I love being able to set reminders and being able to ask Alexa questions or to find a recipe.  I'm sure as time goes on I will learn more about Alexa's capabilities and begin to use other features.,0
5,"Invite Alexa over
  
",1.Sep.19,Yes,"Recently decided to jump aboard and get _lexa in my home. I was indecisive on whether or not if I really needed it... but the answer is yes. I love having the ability to easily listen to my music, and is able to pick my stations (that I actually like). Also connected it too a smart plug which is rather useful. I can spend my mornings easily listening to NPR and evenings jamming to tunes. I recommend it !",0
5,"Great product. Thoughtful and entertaining
  
",2.Sep.19,Yes,"I'm completely in love with alexa. As lazy as it may sound, this tiny device and the app on my phone does so much for me. I've paired it with smart bulbs, my Bluetooth bose, and smart plugs. I'm pretty sure this is one of the best devices Amazon has to offer. We caught them again on sale and for 22.00 at bestbuy and was able to get one for every room in the house. The sound quality is excellent, it's so good sometimes I fail to tell her to connect to the Bluetooth because it's loud enough. Now my drawback is even tho we have one in every room, you have to buy a family subscription to Amazon music to play music more than one device at the time. But if you want her to broadcast the news, the weather, read you a book or the kids a bedtime story, she's amazing. When we leave home, we can tell her to cut the lights on or off by using the app. Now she has a feature I don't quite understand, when you leave you tell her you are leaving, she says OK I will start guarding. But if and when there is noise in the house, she doesn't record the sounds of voices and she doesn't notify you about it either. I had it set to guard, my son and his girlfriend came in from out of town walking taking laughing etc, she did nothing. I come home and tell her I'm home, and she says OK I'll stop guarding. I think the away features should be tweeked. At least let the guard mode send you a notification and a clip of the sounds involved, or send a notification and let you listen to the background so you can decide if it's someone who is supposed to be there or something isn't right. Maybe the technology is still too new but I really hope this feature gets addressed.. It could be valuable and it definitely needs some attention. I've also purchased these at 22.00 for my family members and some friends but with the sale, there was a limit on how many I could buy. At full price, I would only have the one device. I have a Sonos speaker with alexa built-in in my living room but on the other side, I have an echo dot as well. I brag about the features to any friends unfamiliar with it and some of them have bought them and love them just as much as we do. I also bought a 2nd generation from eBay for 10.00 for my grandson whose still little, he likes it but she doesn't understand a word he says..lol. But his mom can walk in his room and tell alexa to read him a book, or tell him a story. They also come with their own phone number which I really like and you can talk room to room. It's hard to get use to calling from it instead of using facetime but it's still handy. Sometimes when you ask for a specific song, you have to pronounce it very proper or she won't understand it. Sometimes she won't understand it or say she can't find it or she will just play some off the wall song that has the same phonics as the title. But to solve that, when I ask for a hard to understand title, I just use the search in my app. I can leave it playing music when I go to work and it plays til I get home. My dog doesn't have to sit in silence. This review ended up being very long but I hope it's helpful. I still haven't learned all she can do yet but I'm working on it... Mad at Amazon right now because they have a stand alone alexa for your car, my friend got hers for 19 bucks but they tell me, I have to be on a waiting list. I don't like the waiting part and who knows how long it will be lol. So for now I have to use the app and my car Bluetooth, but I will survive. If I get comfortable with using just the app in the car, I might not even need the stand alone device.",0
1,"extremely hard to set up
  
",2.Sep.19,Yes,i am 78 years old. in my day they had a wonder full way of turning on an electrical appliance. it is called a flip switch. flip  it up and the machine goes on. flip it down and the machine goes off. i cannot see why the pc cannot tell the ecko dot how to turn on by itself. but alexa is great in what it can do.,1
5,"Easy and fun to use. Over 40 and thrilled I bought it.
  
",2.Sep.19,Yes,"I am not technologically savvy at all and I no problem hooking this up. I bought one on Prime day and then bought an additional two for my home and some smart plugs. I have Alexa in three rooms and set up now to be able to utilize my smart plug so I can turn the lights off and on as I come in or out of the house or up or down the stairs. I get my morning briefing on whatever topics I choose like how many days till the next holiday. I had no smart items in my home and my cell phone is 3 generations behind and I found this easy-to-use and actually a lot of fun. I did sign up for Prime this year so I got the Prime music and all I have to do is tell Alexa what song I want to hear and it plays. My kid meowed at it and Alexa interacts and meows back. It's really just a lot of fun if you're over 40 like me and afraid of this, don't be, it was extremely inexpensive and I have a Galaxy S6 and that's what I use to set it up and I'm really glad I did this.",0
5,"We love ALEXA!
  
",2.Sep.19,Yes,"I purchased as an impulse on Amazon Prime Day, mainly to use as a music speaker, UNTIL a friend told me about all the great things Alexa can do. Our whole family enjoys all her amazing features. I also feel like I am finally catching up on some of our ever-changing technology options, while it gives me some serious piece of mind in regards to her communication features and security system syncing.",0
4,"Cool if it's free
  
",3.Sep.19,Yes,"I got my Echo as a ""gift with purchase"" when I got a new Insignia TV at Best Buy (August 2019), which is the only reason I even have an Echo Dot. I had no desire/need for it, but it's been a fun addition. I don't use it to its potential, partially because I'm not used to it and forget about it even being on my nightstand, but the few tricks I resort to are nice (morning routine/alarm, light and TV switch on-off, weather forecasts).The biggest thing was having to figure out what each color ring means - yes, there's several colors and speed associated with different notifications/status of the device. That's kind of a pain, as you have to memorize them all or pull up the help section on your phone every time the device lights up without being prompt to. I have had a few issues when I had to log out of my amazon account on my tv and log back in - Alexa didn't automatically reconnect to the account, and it took a good 20 minutes for me to figure out what was going on. Voice recognition can be obnoxious too, as sometimes I have to really raise my voice even if I'm in the same room as the device - and people in other rooms can definitely hear me ""yell"" at it ""ALEXA!""Overall, it's a fun little gadget to have around the house. I'm obsessed with its design and have been told you can actually even buy cases/masks for it if you want it a different color/pattern. Wouldn't have spent my money on it, but that's just me!",0
5,"Slight improvements over the 2nd Generation Echo Dot
  
",3.Sep.19,Yes,"Seems the sound quality is better with the 3rd Gen version.  Seems like it can ""hear"" you voice better than the 2nd gen, notice it most with a lot of background noise.  I think it also looks better.  Only slight changes from the 2nd gen, but I love my 2nd Gen Echo Dots.  My brother bought me my first Echo Dot for Christmas a few years ago along with a couple of smart plugs.  Nice present, and something I wanted, but not something I would have bought for myself. Nice little ""toy"" to have I thought.  Now I have some type of Alexa device in every room in my house, 2 in some rooms if you count the Fire Sticks, not to mention my Ring Doorbell, Ring Alarm System, smart plugs, etc.  Oh, I also have an Alexa Auto in my truck.  Probably not the best person to review Alexa and Alexa enabled devices.  Amazon now owns me.  That nice little toy I got a few years ago has taken over my house, truck, and me.  On the rare events when the Internet goes out, it has the same impact on my life as the power going out.",0
3,"Pretty useless
  
",3.Sep.19,Yes,"Okay so that title's not entirely true, because it's nice to ask alexa to turn the volume down or hit the next song, but even those commands don't always work.the speaker sounds muffled, but if you're in a roommate situation it gets loud enough, i have a second speaker now but i was already going into this relationship knowing i'd have to supplement with thatit's a bit inconvenient because you trust that your music will shuffle or loop but it doesn't and you have to manually ask for those commands each time or set them in your phone, kind of takes away the purpose of it thoughthe volume controls were easily the most irritating thing, i still have this dot and the comprehension from the voice commands just isn't there",0
5,"A Must Have
  
",3.Sep.19,Yes,"This product has helped improve day do day life.  I connected my device to lights so now instead of stumbling in the dark until I find a light switch, I just ask Alexa to turn the lights on.  I've enabled skills and connected Alexa to my spotify so I'm able to listen to news and music while I'm tidying up around the house.  Alexa has also connected to my contacts so I'm able to call people through my device.The speaker has excellent quality as well.  A friend who was visiting once was surprised that the music I was playing was coming out of my dot.  The sound quality is phenomenal for a device that small.I've also noticed that Alexa is getting better at understanding Southern Accents.  If you're a southerner who has been hesitant about buying one due to bad voice recognition experiences in the past, you won't be disappointed by Alexa.",0
3,"Sound Quality Sucks Compared to Earlier Versions of Echo Dot
  
",3.Sep.19,Yes,"I received my new Echo Dot (ordered on Prime Day 2019). It was delayed in delivery due to the high volume of purchasers on Prime Day. However, this Echo Dot has the worst sound quality of any of my dots I've purchased. (I have 5 of them throughout my house and garage. I don't know if they rush ordered these from China and bypassed the quality control or if they made them cheaply to offer at the 1/2 price discount for Prime Day...but I'm totally disappointed. I'd return it, except then I'd have to pay full price (and I already turned in my better performing 2nd Gen Echo Dot for the trade-in discount). Buyers beware - you get what you pay for! :(",0
1,"Sounded muffled. Gen 1 sounds better
  
",3.Sep.19,Yes,"I purchased this on Amazon Day and got a great deal. I have a 1st generation that I have been very happy with so I wanted to have a dot for my bathroom. The first one arrived and from the get go I was unimpressed. It sounded muffled and I tried it in different rooms in the house but nothing helped. I exchanged the Echo Dot through Amazon and the second one sounded exactly the same, muffled. I did find the settings and turned the bass all the way down and that seemed to help some but not enough. My 1st gen still sounds way better. When I talked to Amazon about doing one last exchange to see if I could get a good product and was told that my only option was to return it for a refund and repurchase. Now they cost twice as much......",0
1,"Pairing sucks  very few products supported.
  
",3.Sep.19,Yes,"I find that this product is a lot harder to pair with your home devices. Google mini Will pair within seconds with the Alexa device you have to jump through a whole bunch of hoops it's kind of ridiculous.  UPDATE  Amazon contacted me and put me in touch with support to help pair.  Alexa is NOT compatible with LG tv's, Vizio Soundbars, and several other popular products.  Google Home Supports all these devices and more and connects in seconds.  I don't know why this product is so popular unless it's just popular with people who don't want there house connected to the device.  I regret this purchase.",0
5,"Incredibly Helpful Device
  
",3.Sep.19,Yes,"I ordered my Echo Dot on July 27th 2019 as my mother and her significant other had owned one downstairs. I realized overtime how helpful it was so I ordered it as part of my early birthday money.I use my Echo Dot for alarms, weather updates, timers, google questions, sleep sounds. She has been so perfect for me and you have the option to change her wake from Alexa, Echo, Computer. I also use my Echo Dot for my lighting in my room that changes color and I can adjust them by saying the name of the light and the color I want along with dimming percentage.She helps with math questions and just everything you can think of as I listed. It's great for being lazy too, haha. Just the best purchase I've ever made off Amazon hands down. Go get yourself one!",0
4,"Ordered 2 (1 had responsive glitch, fixed)
  
",3.Sep.19,Yes,"I_ not sure how to rate this. I just received my devices and have used them for a full day. I do love the product, but I ordered 2 devices and one doesn_ work properly. I have to unplug it and plug it back in before speaking or give the command for it to do an action to the other device In order to get it to work. It_ very annoying.I would return the 2nd device and exchange it, but I live abroad and it_ not cost effective to do so. A bit disappointed.(Update) I found an online recommendation for a fix, changing the Wake word improves responsiveness. Upgraded my review to 4-stars This is a great organizational tool, but there are improvements to be made. It would be nice to see improvements in voice recognition, additionally clarity in Alexa_ voice, and more support between apps and devices, such as Apple Watch. I_ interested to do how these types of devices develop I the future.",0
1,"Problems right out of the box
  
",3.Sep.19,Yes,I recently purchased a new WiFi smart thermostat and received an echo dot 3rd gen for free.  It did not take long to realize why they were giving them away.  The set up was seemingly simple how ever the function of the unit pails in comparison to my two Google home minis.  When playing music the audio cuts out constantly. Sometimes it will pickup were it left off and other times it will skip to the next song.  After doing a quick search online it became quite apparent that this is a largely know problem.  Sorry Amazon but you have some work to do.  Let me know if you want  it back....  After speaking with someone who instructed how to perform and update on the device as it is several versions old it did not work.  I spoke to another rep this morning who insists that it is my WiFi and completely ignored the software level even after being told several times.  The product is in a business with top of the line WiFi which supports 5 vehicle scan tool devices with no problems.  Finally she instructed me to ask ALEXA to update software which i cant do because that function is not available with the current software level.  So frustrated and not even worth it since it was free.  This thing is going in the trash and I will be returning my daughters Fire tablet given the poor customer service.,0
5,"Impressive sound quality and voice recognition.
  
",4.Sep.19,Yes,"So, this is my first Alexa device. I'd been holding out because I'd witnessed my friends struggle with earlier versions of Alexa, yelling at it when it didn't obey a voice command and I wasn't impressed by the sound.But, Amazon had a great sale on the Dot so I figured I'd try it out.  The sound quality is amazing. I can't believe this little thing has such a big sound.The voice recognition is really good too. I rarely have to repeat a command and it recognizes even the most brief command from me. For instance, first thing in the morning I'm groggy and mumble ""Computer, Lana DelRay"" and it plays Lana DelRay easily.I call it ""Computer"" because you can change the wake word options on this model.  Your choices are Alexa, Amazon, Echo or Computer. I chose Computer because I'm a Trekkie and addressing the device like Jean-Luc Picard makes my inner nerd happy. I assume that's why they made that option available in the first place.I like the Skills. Particularly the morning skill. I can say Good Morning and it gives me the weather, calendar and news.I don't use the ""Tell Me Joke"" skill or anything like that, but there are a couple of fun Star Trek skills you can add that are fun.All in all I'm very happy with this device. I may have to buy a smart plug for my lamp and expand Alexa's responsibilities.",1
1,"DONT BUY THE WHITE ONES
  
",4.Sep.19,Yes,"I bought a total of four dots recently.  I originally bought two black dots and was over the moon with them so I immediately hopped back on to Amazon and tried to buy two more but all they had left at the time was the white version. I figured the only difference was the color. I was wrong...and the white ones are AWFUL.I have to unplug and restart them every other day because Alexa will say ""I'm having a hard time understanding please try later"" when we go to use her. We unplug and replug the dot back and she starts working again. until 36-48 hours later when we have to do it again.  I have not had to do this with the black version to date (I purchased them on Prime day 2019). Then there is the volume issue with the white ones... If you want to use the ""drop in"" feature you must have the volume up all the way and the other person still comes through like a whisper. So when you go to play music or listen to an audio book you get blasted. Again, I have do not have this issue with the black dots. The main reason I bought the additional dots was for this issue. I have three kids and we live in a 4400 sq foot home that doesn't have an intercom system. I figured have four dots (and I had purchased an Echo the year before) would cut down on the yelling in the house.I basically have two great dots and two white paperweights.",1
1,"WiFi Support Limited up to ""N""!
  
",4.Sep.19,Yes,"I purchased 3 Amazon Echo Dot 3rd gen to use as an intercom and for entertainment around my home and I noticed immediately the Echo Dot has severe Wi-Fi COMPATIBILITY issues that are not so beyond average consumers:1) Wi-Fi support is advertised as 2.4 Ghz and 5 Ghz connectivity however the dot will not see 'AC' networks that I have set up. The 2.4 Ghz network still inadequate even though signal strength reports FULL. Checking Wi-Fi signal strength from the access point shows that the Echo Dot 3rd Gen has a signal quality of above 80% and even comparing superior, similar, and inferior devices with much lower signal strength and a much higher SNR (Signal to Noise Ratio) the Echo Dot is guaranteed to have issues. I am so astonished by the design of something that can't even stay connected as well as something with batteries!2) The Echo Dot 3rd Generation does not have a ""built-in"" battery for a  ""lightweight speaker"" and using the Alexa app for ""setting it up"" becomes a routine nuisance. It would be much better if voice prompts could be eliminated altogether and ""maybe if it just had lights""... must be the ULTRA COOL THERMODYNAMIC DESIGNIt can definitely keep your beer cold!",1
1,"Very disappointed
  
",4.Sep.19,Yes,"After a year of using my Echo Plus as an alarm clock in my studio apartment, I found myself missing it when I moved into a place with walls. I bought the Dot when it was on sale for $29.99 because, not only did I now need one for my bedroom, but it was cheaper than a lot of alarm clock options. The best of both worlds. WELL. The error message of Not Being Able to Connect to the Internet became a daily problem very quickly. I tried every troubleshoot from every blog I could find, and I spent quite some time on the phone with amazon trying to figure out why it wasn_ working. Surprise! If it isn_ connected to the internet, the alarm won_ go off. So I woke up late for work and decided it was the last straw. I think I got a dud and it_ going back.As if this wasn_ already kind of disappointing, I am not allowed to do an even swap for a new Dot. The only option I was given, aside from mailing it in and having techs look at it for an undisclosed amount of time was to return it (since I am still within the return window.) However, the price has risen to $49.99, so if I want a new one I have to pay the difference, which is ridiculous. My Echo Plus stays connected just fine. And the Dot was maybe 20 feet from my router, so, again, I think I just got a dud. It_ disappointing that they couldn_ do an even exchange of a Dot for a Dot, especially since this thing stopped working almost immediately. And frankly, when it worked it was a cool gadget, but I am not sure it_ worth $50.",1

It's the most fabulous thing ever,  you have GOT to try this.  I can't wait until they put ""Alexa"" into a real moving robot.  It will probably happen in the future, and it will be super awesome.

Sometimes I notice it lights up when I walk past it, maybe listening for a command. So I guess that might be why people say it_ always listening? Anyway, we are pleased with it and now we got second one for upstairs.",0
5,"Patience
  
",4.Sep.19,Yes,"Seems I cannot pause in the middle of a question or inquiry without her turning back off. Most people pause in a sentence where a comma would be. Then I have to start over. This is my only complaint. I use it all the time to make phone calls, check on weather, play music and questions so I do not have to pause in my work to find the answer. On the last version people could barely hear me unless I was standing right in front of it, no more. Very happy with it!",0
5,"Impressive sound quality
  
",4.Sep.19,Yes,"Very good sound quality and fast selections. At the promotion price I bought 2. Don_ regret it at all. Fully recommend to anyone. The free music selection is phenomenal,  I hear songs from artist that I never knew they had done. My selection is easy listening like Buble, Stewart, Denver, Journey, Eagles, Queen, Sheeren and Spanish singers like Gloria, Solis, Lopez. The selection is out of this world.",0
5,"My toddler uses it more than me
  
",4.Sep.19,Yes,My echo dot is a fancy baby shark machine in my kitchen. It also plays _ou_e Welcome by Duane _he Rock Johnson from Moana over and over some days.I really enjoy it because now I can listen to podcasts without burning through my battery or while surfing Facebook. I bought 2 others but have yet to install in other rooms and sun them.,0
2,"Annoying as ****
  
",5.Sep.19,Yes,"I only wanted it for one reason. That whenever I come home and want to relax I can just give it an command by voice to play my music. It seem there no way for it to create my own personal music play list. I can not upload or add music that I already have safe on my phone or computer to make the play list. I have to use crappy 3rd party music apps or spend more money to buy songs I already have if I wanted to make my own music play list.update after 3 whole days since my first review of this because it has since an high star review rate I wanted to give it an chance and keep using it. Honestly I only bought it because it was on sale for 29.99 instead of the normal 50dollars and I have to say this is one of the worst 30dollars I have ever spend and I have spend my money recklessly a lot during my life. If you try to give it two commands in one sentence it will completely ignore you and not reply back at all. For example "" Alexa I do not like this song stop playing this song. "" Alexa will just ignore it and keep playing. You need to say "" Alexa I do not like this song"" than it will add to the list of song. Than after that yu have to say "" Alexa stop playing this song"" for it to stop playing the song. Another issue I have is that I can not type in the song titles that I want to listen to and have to keep saying the music title and names of the artists. Can not even type in the song title on the Alexa app on my phone that connect to the device.",1
5,"Works as well and sounds as great as the Alexa.
  
",5.Sep.19,Yes,"Let me start off by saying I am not very tech savvy.  I had no idea what the difference was between the Alexa or the Echo dot. I ordered the Dot. The set up was quite simple.  There are step by step instructions on how to download the app and get it set up on your network.  I had it programmed and up and running in no time.I am so glad I went on and purchased this.  I was worried that I wouldn't use it very much and it would not be as good as the Alexa. But that was not the case.  My 4 y.o. and I love doing many things with Echo. Setting reminders, alarms , listening to music/ podcasts are just a few of the things we use it for everyday.  My favorite is being able to listen to music while I am in the kitchen cooking.  I can skip songs, pause the music and even turn the volume down all without having to stop what I am doing. I would definitely recommend buying the Echo dot. We now have 4 of them in our house!",0
4,"Alexa is my best friend
  
",5.Sep.19,Yes,"I love my Alexa (Echo Dot). Whenever I feel the need to google something I just have to ask Alexa. I don't even do math anymore, Alexa is my math wiz. I use it most often for listening to music, and that's the one thing it still lacks on - sound quality. It doesn't really go that high in volume and the quality of the sound isn't that great. It's not bad, but I have cheaper wireless speakers that are louder and have better sound. I still love it though because I can just tell it to play the songs I want.",0
4,"Voice command is very good
  
",5.Sep.19,Yes,"We received an Echo Dot (3rd gen) for Christmas and my wife took full possession of it so I bought another for me. This one doesn't function as well as the first. It starts and stops and will sometimes play for hours as background music and other times stops after perhaps two songs, five songs; it can be any combination of continuous songs.  If there are upgrades in quality, (not just price) and you are determined to have one, spend the money for better quality.",0
2,"Know before you buy!
  
",5.Sep.19,Yes,Love this as long as I'm connecting at home but if you travel for work like I do its basically worthless. Most times it won't connect in hotels and if it does the connection isn't stable. It won't even connect in a corporate apartment.It's fine when I'm home but since I'm rarely there it's going to be gifted to someone else.There should be a warning about connection issues. They also said I could possibly hotspot it for a connection but since I'm not in the country I'd probably get roaming charges. If I had known I wouldn't have purchased this or the music upgrade. Waste of money!,0
5,"Announcements are the best!
  
",5.Sep.19,Yes,Addition to our family echo dot lineup.  We love the ability to make announcements across our house.  Really cut down on the yelling to get our voice heard from one level to the next.  Nighttime music and sleep timer is used every night.  Never wanted these devices but now that we have a few we love them.  Really spend some time playing with the skills and reading some articles to get the most out of your device. Wish I did that a lot sooner.,0
5,"Compact alternative to the full size Echo
  
",5.Sep.19,Yes,"We have had a full size Echo in our family room for more than a year, and wanted to have Alexa pipe music in our living room as well.  The Echo Dot is a very nice,  unobtrusive unit, and its audio output plug allows us to directly connect it (rather than depending upon a Bluetooth receiver) to our home entertainment unit and its 12"" subwoofer, for much richer music than any built-in small speaker could hope to achieve.",0
5,"Alexa, order another Echo Dot!
  
",6.Sep.19,Yes,"O.k. I had NO IDEA that the Echo Dot could work all on its own! I thought that you had to have a base Alexa unit, and the dots were just add-ons. Nope! I was recently at a BBQ and they were entertaining the birthday guests with the Echo Dot! Alexa even sang Happy Birthday to the birthday girl! How crazy is that? The host had the Echo Dot connected to this really cool Bluetooth speaker and it sounded great in the backyard, in fact, they had to keep turning it down because people were yelling over the music!After the party I was sold and had to go home and order my own Echo Dot! It is insane how much this little device can do! You can ask Alexa anything and she will come up with an answer from google. Very rarely does she not have an answer for your question. She will tell you jokes, weather, news, etc. You can set timers, alarms, add items to your grocery/to do list, or control your smart T.V. without even picking up the remote!The Echo Dot sounds phenomenal. For the small size (about the size of your palm) this thing can put out a lot of sound! and if you are trying to be quiet , you can whisper to Alexa and she will whisper back to you! You can tell Alexa to play a specific song, or a genre of music and rock out for hours. You can make hands free calls to your loved ones!I am in love with my new Echo Dot and will be purchasing more for other rooms in the house (you can even sync music and notifications to all of the dots throughout your house!)My one complaint about the Echo Dot is the length of the cord. I wish it were a bit longer, but hey, minor detail. I would recommend this to anyone who likes a little hands free technology and entertainment in their home!",0
4,"Hands free! Great sound quality.
  
",6.Sep.19,Yes,"Okay so I_e been eyeing these guys for a long time. When they went on sale I decided it was time. I mostly use it for music, reminders and timers. So far I_ happy with the before mentioned. I am however annoyed that the Pandora app doesn_ work well with the device. I_e been listening to amazons music option, it_ similar to pandora but works much better with this device. I_ sure apps will become more compatible in the future.I_ be interested in getting more and using them as intercoms in our home. This seems like a really cool option to get the kids up in the morning or tell them it_ time to do something. Or that they can come out of their timeouts! LolI also like that you can use FreeTime like on the kids tablets and it will read to them.It_ a cool little device with excellent sound quality. I normally stream music thru the tv. Now I don_ have to and it_ hands free! I love it!!!",0
4,"A nice addition to daily carpentry projects
  
",6.Sep.19,Yes,"I purchased this to stream music, radio stations and podcasts while working on various projects around and outside the house. It has decent sound quality, an upgrade from a transistor radio but that's about it. Voice recognition and streaming functions are excellent. One smallish complaint: it stops from time to time for no apparent reason, but will then resume on command most of the time. Also worth noting, perhaps: it doesn't like to get too hot. It has shut down on multiple occasions when it was placed in full sunlight on a hot day. After some minutes in the shade, it will reboot. Overall, a nice way to have on demand entertainment while working on a project.",0
2,"The sound is terrible: Muffled
  
",6.Sep.19,Yes,I have not found a fix for the sound issue with the Dot 3.It's terrible the sound is so Muffled you can barely make out what is said music not clear. I'm not the only one with this issue. All the fixes on the internet apply to the DOT 2 not the 3. There is no firmware update to fix the sound. I'm so disappointed! You may want to see if there is a fix for this BEFORE you order this model!,1
4,"You may integrate it in your life in areas you never dreamed!
  
",6.Sep.19,Yes,"I love owning this! There is no way I'm using it to it's fullest potential, though I've picked several things that I want it to do and it does them almost flawlessly.I have personalized it, too. I went on vacation for a week. When I got home I asked Alexa if she missed me (jokingly). She responded that it's great to have me back lolCON: I told her that I was depressed. She responded by giving me several numbers I could call. Knowing that if I were a teenager that wouldn't help me, I told her I just wanted to talk to her. She sent me to an AI who basically tried to force me to talk about movies. I tried again but adding that I wanted to hurt myself. She sent me to a different AI. It's not good at helping someone who may be suicidal.",0
5,"Very Pleased
  
",6.Sep.19,Yes,I upgraded from an original Dot to this 3rd Generation Dot and couldn't be more pleased.  I wanted better sound quality because I listen to a lot of music on it.  The sound is considerably louder and also richer.  And there was another plus for me.  On the original Dot I had to turn straight to it for it to hear me.  I can have my back turned to the new one and am still clearly heard.  I got the gray one and think it looks very nice.,0
1,"Alexa and Amazon are getting a little too big for there britches!
  
",6.Sep.19,Yes,"Alexa and the echo devices are becoming increasingly less cooperative every time I use them.  Cannot get them to work the way they are supposed to like playing the same music on multiple echo devices through creating a home group.  I made sure I am on the family plan so I keep upping my subscriptions and I keep experiencing more and more technical difficulties.  How much does it cost before it just stops working and gives me the big middle finger?  Seriously thinking about getting rid of all forms of Alexa, echo devices and Amazon all together.  If I can't get what I want and am already paying the top price for all of amazon's music services there is nothing else I can do but stop giving them my money!",0
5,"Love it!
  
",6.Sep.19,Yes,"Constantly finding new ways to use Alexa! Us over 50 crowd can really appreciate how exciting tools like Echo Dot are!I'm taking it for granted that I can ask Alexa to play any music track  - and it streams down upon me!  40 years ago that would have entailed - driving over to the record store - making the purchase bringing it home -  putting it on the record player and an hour or so later listening to it. Thanks, Amazon!!PS- I do miss not having record stores.",0
5,"Better than 2nd Generation and good value
  
",6.Sep.19,Yes,"I replaced a second generation Echo Dot with this model. I like the looks and the volume can be turned up a lot higher without distortion.  Only drawback I have found is that the sound is heavy on the bass and even getting Alexa to turn up the treble it still not great voice talk radio. However, for music it is great. Good price and versatility.",0
3,"Not as good as Google Home mini
  
",6.Sep.19,Yes,"We were previously a Google home but the concept of ""Drop in"" was the deciding factor to switch.  After using the Echo for a few weeks we have discovered that the voice recognition is not quite as good, the returned answers are not quite as good and 1/2 the time when we use the drop in features we end up standing next to the Echo yelling at it so the person on the other end can hear us. Overall disappointed.",0
4,"Love the sound quality and nee look of this version
  
",7.Sep.19,Yes,"Great sound from such a small device. Location selection can make a huge difference in sound quality and voice recognition. Placing near a wall / metal objects can cause echoes which can confuse alexa or distort the sound quality.Some apps are great.  Others need improvement.  Depends what you are using the smart device for and the product support associated with the external device.Voice recognition works great, even with kids still learning to speak.  Our little one is able to request his favorite children's song without a problem",6
1,"Newest batch defective
  
",7.Sep.19,Yes,"We already have a few 3rd Gen Dots in our house and they have always worked perfectly (not the greatest sound quality but they work perfectly).  This makes it easy to stream music to all of the Alexa devices at the same time.  Incidentally, we also have a Show and a Spot which both work just fine too.  I recently purchased two new Dots on sale from Amazon...  I spent a week trying to get them to work to no avail.  They just drop out when playing music after only 1-3 songs.I went nuts checking my internet and wifi signals everywhere...  our wifi coverage is all great.  Next, I moved on to just testing an old Dot in its usual place for an hour...  worked perfectly streaming music.  Then replaced it with a new Dot in the same exact location...  it would drop out to silence within 1-3 songs.  Put the old Dot back in place...  worked perfectly for an hour.  I did this with both Dots in multiple locations and the two new Dots consistently failed.  It was clearly the new Dots that had some defective component in them.I've returned the two Dots.  The return process was a nightmare as well.  I wanted to exchange these for new ones but I had to wait on a call from Customer Service...  I couldn't just check off an exchange on their returns page.  They insisted upon talking to Customer Service...  the page indicated they would call within 10 mins or so...  I waited two hours...  no call.  In the end, I have opted to return for a full refund instead.When I purchase the last 2-3 Dots that I need to complete the home, if I get one more defective unit, I am done with the Echo line.  I'll toss them all in the garbage and purchase another brand.  This problem has wasted far too much of my time.  Amazon's exchange procedures were impossible to use too.",0
1,"Terrible voice recognition compared to 2nd gen, and very frustrating
  
",7.Sep.19,Yes,"I have three Echo Dots, but this is my only 3rd Gen Echo Dot  yet it_ the one that works the most poorly. It has a terrible time hearing or recognizing commands. I keep the new Echo Dot downstairs, and my older Echo Dots upstairs. When I am downstairs and give an Alexa command, the upstairs ones can hear me, but the downstairs one can_! It_ frustrating if what I am wanting is music or audio, since I cannot hear the upstairs ones very well from downstairs, but they can hear me give the command from downstairs. When I play Jeopardy, for example, I can scream right into the new 3rd gen, and it does not recognize my answer. My two 2nd generations never had this problem, and they still don_. Until Amazon comes out with a better version, you are better off getting the 2nd gen Echo dot and attaching a Bluetooth speaker to it to get the superior sound that the 3rd gen is supposed to provide. Currently, the 3rd gen is a waste of your money.",1
5,"Hooray for Alexa!
  
",7.Sep.19,Yes,"I highly recommend the Echo Dot 3rd generation to anyone looking to delve into Alexa products or looking to update their current wares. We currently have 5 total in our house -- two 2nd generations + three 3rd generations -- and the sound quality of the 3rd generation is far superior. While the unit itself may be little, these provide perfect (and booming, if you want!) ambience for parties, endless entertainment for kids (try, ""Alexa, tell me bedtime story!""), and a great &amp; accessible hub for controlling smart house functions.For the not-quite-perfect aspects, we've had a bit of trouble with the voice recognition at times. Not only does Alexa refuse to pronounce my name even remotely right, she often misunderstands (I'd say once out of every 5 commands) and sometimes has trouble connecting to the internet, even with a strong signal.That being said, the pros definitely outweigh the cons (really, quite negligible for the benefits), and for the affordable price of the dot, this is a must have!",0
2,"Free with a purchase.
  
",7.Sep.19,Yes,"I honestly cant think of a more useless device. As someone who doesnt enjoy talking to devices and who doesnt have their entire life integrated into devices , the only thing that this is ""useful"" for is telling my Roomba to start cleaning. But I also have an app on my phone that does that sooo yea, donated this to a new med student.",1
3,"It_ just okay.
  
",7.Sep.19,Yes,"The echo sometimes doesn_ recognize we are calling it. And sometimes decides not to listen.  We use it as a baby monitor (sound only) mostly, for a couple of reasons. 1. We have an Alexa that_ way better. 2. The echo responsiveness or lack of is very frustrating.  3. It doesn_ execute commands correctly.  You can ask it to play a song from an artist and it_l play something entirely different. We_e looking at upgrading to a show but for now this will do.",0
5,"Pretty cool device
  
",8.Sep.19,Yes,"Yes, I'm aware that it's recording everything I say and that I have to tell it daily to delete my voice in the event I say anything worth deleting.  But I just replaced my ancient, beat-up clock radio in the kitchen with this sweet little device that plays my local NPR station, or all the hits of 1991, or the weather.  It even tells me bad jokes.  Plus I finally have someone in the house that I can boss around.  Seriously, the sound on this little inexpensive thing is much better than the pricier radio it replaced.  I couldn't be happier.  I haven't tried integrating it with anything.  That's a little above my pay grade.",0
3,"Great, but Drop In barely works
  
",8.Sep.19,Yes,"I honestly really like this little thing. I got it in white and it looks very nice. Sometimes (and I mean really not too often at all) she'll mishear something and I'm not too frustrated as I know it happens to others as well. I dont have any complaints about the audio quality but I also didn't purchase this to fill my whole entire house with music. It does fill up an entire room though and that's enough for me when I'm relaxing at home. I do have one complaint and it's the only reason I am giving 3 stars. I'm not sure if I received a faulty product but whenever I ""drop in"" with my boyfriend he'll be trying to talk to me and when I answer, he says he can barely hear me. This is so strange to me because I can hear him just fine and Alexa responds to me even when I'm across the room, but for me to be directly over the Alexa Dot and for him to tell me that with his volume all the way up he can still barely hear me tells me that maybe something's wrong with mine? I'm not sure exactly and it's really strange to me. Also slightly disappointed about that. Other than that, I really like this dot.",0
5,"Great easily concealed devices!
  
",8.Sep.19,Yes,"We were never to ""into"" this idea.  However the sound quality of the Echo devices is really great and since it's nice to summon music anytime!  So we took the plunge!Also being able to easily set reminders (great for older folks), alarms and multiple timers and ask for solutions to math problems is truly appreciated.  These devices work very well and they provide a great informational interactive opportunity.  Highly recommend!!",0
4,"For $29.99, it's a good deal
  
",8.Sep.19,Yes,"Can retrieve all music in Amazon library, though the library does lack some music.  Sometimes you have to re-phrase request to get what you want.  Must always speak a little loud and definitely clear.  Sound for music is very good from such a small device.

4,"Fun as long as you understand the intrusions
  
",8.Sep.19,Yes,"Very simple to link to my laptop, did recognize my small grandson trying to talk to it and wouldn't respond.  It's probably true that ""someone"" can listen in so we simply unplug it should we decide to have a personal conversation within earshot. I also didn't link it to my phone. Very good at picking up music selections, answering questions and keeping alarms going as needed. Excellent deal for $30!",0
1,"Doesn't work with streaming Pandora
  
",9.Sep.19,Yes,"My Echo and Echo Dot 2nd generation stream Pandora without any difficulty. However, Echo Dot 3rd generation does not. About halfway through a song, the 3rd gen model quit and started a new song. Amazon technical support was not able to fix this, despite putting me through a very long series of steps, resets, reboots, and so on. All was fruitless and so they sent me a new unit, but it has the same problem. It's too bad that Amazon cannot recognize a problem like this and solve it. Ultimately gave me my money back because because of this. Very disappointed, especially since the first and second generations work fine without this problem.",1
1,"""Hmm, I don't know that""
  
",9.Sep.19,Yes,"this is Alexas most frequent response. She knows nothing. Not who discovered America, the date of Bull Run, when the first model T rolled off the Ford line.  She does however, know and to her credit, how to say ""Hmm. I don't know that"" in a lovely faux-British accent that many New Yorker's adopt when they place reservations at 5-star restaurants (which of course Alexa is clueless at to who they are).Mine went back to its maker after 3 days.

I love her dearly.  She tells me jokes.  She tells me math problems.  She gives me driving advice.  She lets me play games.  She reminds me to do important tasks. She converts cooking measurements and times.  She knows every recipe.  She speaks every language.  She is a wealth of knowledge.  She's an Enstine and even knows my voice, and my favorite music.

5,"100% better then first version
  
",9.Sep.19,Yes,"I  have two of the first version and the new one is much better.  The speaker quality and volume is hugely improved and I like the new style (less utilitarian looking).  Was easy to setup (of course) and recognizes my voice even if I'm not speaking loudly.  It's a Echo....what more do you need to know.  Of course, I  have a Google device as well cause neither do everything I want.  Maybe they should mate and produce a Google Little Dot. :)",0
4,"Better sound than I thought I would find
  
",10.Sep.19,Yes,"I was hesitant to buy one of these because some purists had remarked the sound was imperfect. Well, the Echo Dot sounds like a much more expensive speaker. Of course, it cannot compete with Bose Speakers. But for the price and the voice recognition feature plus Alexa integration, I am definitely impressed at the value for money. I must say that the voice recognition is not yet perfect, but it is very good at this skill as well. I have had the device misunderstand my command several times when the air conditioner is running in the room.There is one little drawback to this device. The skills software routines are incapable of running every app you may have or wish to activate. I have a favorite app that runs a music service that is not Amazon, Apple, Spotify, etc. I must start that app manually. Another drawback with the Alexa integrated environment is the Fire Tablet cannot be used as one of the stations in a music group, for example when I want to play music across multiple rooms. For that, you MUST purchase Echo of one model or another. That bothers me since I use a Fire Tablet on a Show Mode Stand to control my integrated home system, but in order for me to have true house-wide music, I must purchase an Echo device for the room in which I have my Fire Tablet on Show Mode setup. In any case, the system is maturing and I am hopeful the Amazon Software Weenies will repair this oversight.",0
1,"BUYERS BEWARE , Amazon will only replace faulty item with a refurbished one
  
",10.Sep.19,Yes,"I ordered two echo dot 3's when Amazon had their ""big sale"".  One set up to wi-if no problem and has worked great since. The second one, I had to try several times to connect, before I was successful. But it did not stay connected and all I could get out of it was a "" I'm having difficulties at this time, please try later"" response. At times it would just start talking without even being prompted.Then it might work for a week or so before it wouldn't do anything. I reached out to customer service via chat. That chat lasted over thirty  minutes only to be "" disconnected "" before problem resolved.  Again I reconnected going thru all the steps.  Week later it didn't stay connected, so I called and talked to a "" electronic specialist "".  That call was over half an hour long. I tried requesting a return shipping label, so I could send it back and get a new replacement since it was a faulty device. I was told that is not an option. I would have to send it back and they would fix it.  I responded that I bought a new item and want a new one as a replacement, not a ""FIXED ITEM ""  He finally agreed to send out a NEW echo dot and I would have to return the original.  A few days later, I received a ""REFURBISHED"" echo dot 3.  When I called to speak to a  supervisor, I was told that it is their policy to send refurbished ones if a new one is not in ""their stock"".  Doesn't matter they have new ones to sell on the website. I told him that I don't except that and it was not what I paid for. And if they are sending out refurbished echos, there must be a huge problem with them. He advised that they test them and to try it out.  So I opened the box.  All that was in the box was the echo dot. No power source .  Again 4th time reaching out to a Tech specialist- supervisor and 45 minutes of phone time. I was told that they only send device out when replacing. And they don't send out any accessories. When was a plug considered an accessory when it is needed to use device.  Again I told him that I bought a new device and it was faulty and I wanted a new device as a replacement.  Not one that has been fixed.  Also I found out that the 90 day warranty did not begin again when the replacement device gets registered. They back date it to the original sell date of first device.  So I only had 40 days left on the warranty.  Also if you go on line , a refurbished echo goes for $29.99, compared to the $ 49.00 , for a new one. Not once did any representative say that I would be refunded the $20.00 difference for the refurbished echo dot. I told him that this is an AMAZON echo dot. It has their name on the product and they should stand behind their name. I also said if I were to buy a tv from a store and took it home and it quit working, they would replace it with a new tv, not a refurbished one. I will never buy another electronic device that AMAZON sells with their name on it. I will tell all my friends and family that they will get screwed if something goes wrong with their product. So buyer beware.  Amazon does not stand behind their products and the consumer whom keeps their  business Alive.",0

Other times, it doesn_ recognize half the speech and has a static sound when it_ playing music.Side note: quite a bit of music isn_ available on Alexa so that_ also disappointing. Do some research before purchasing. I did but might have made a different decision had I known the limited music library (unless purchases occur through prime) and how Alexa records your conversations while it stays plugged in.",0
5,"Works as well as the larger model.
  
",10.Sep.19,Yes,"The Echo Dot has surprisingly good sound, and works just as well as our larger Echo. We have had it for nearly a year and love having it for our favorite music channels. It comes with an App on your phone and you are able to rate the music you are hearing. If you don_ like a certain song, rate it thumbs down, and you won_ hear it again. After a while you are only hearing great songs on the station you are choosing.",0
5,"Is Alexa and Dot a tool or a toy?  They are useful so I say a tool.
  
",11.Sep.19,Yes,"I purchased a three pack of the Alexa dots. One is destined for my shop. I have a Wi-Fi range extender there so it gives me Alexa communication there. One was a gift to my girlfriend_ grand-daughter and the third will be a gift to another friend. The dot seems to communicate as well as the regular Alexa and makes for easy hands free calling between my house and my girlfriend or her daughter_. They stream music. Tell jokes. Give me weather reports, timer, alarms, trivia, just a fun verbal internet toy or tool?  Gee. That may be a question I need to ask Alexa. I bought her as a toy but she definitely has proven to be a useful tool.",0
4,"Alexa doesn't Like certain Internet
  
",11.Sep.19,Yes,"So when I originally got Alexa, I  got her all set up, but when I had her learn my voice, she glitched out. She wouldn't understand a lot of actions I had said to her that were pretty basic.I had called tech support and we reset my Alexa back to factory settings TWICE and she still did the same glitch, so I received a replacement Alexa.Once I got my replacement I thought for sure the issue would be resolved, but it wasn't. The same thing was happening. I thought maybe it was a system malfunction and maybe it was happening to everyone and people just knew to wait for it to be fixed.But today I had switched my internet provider from Windstream to Spectrum. And suddenly SHE WORKED CORRECTLY! I'm so happy because all the functions I bought her for weren't really working correctly until today.So, If you have internet speeds that are under 30mps you may not get the full alexa experience you were hoping for. I know I will defiantly be getting a second alexa now that I know why she wasn't working originally.She's really helpful for someone with memory problems, especially since she's connected to your phone as well. She also helps with keeping up with our calendar because my fiance refuses to check his phone for his schedule.Overall Alexa has been a great addition. I just wish I would have known what speed of internet is required to make her work.",0
5,"Baby shark for daysssss
  
",11.Sep.19,Yes,I got this free on a _enew Sirius deal.Didn_ think much of it till we got it home. Construction is surprisingly really well done.My toddlers love it because they can run into the room and ask for baby shark or to check on what their unicorn is doing. Makes me having to pull up baby shark on my phone a think of the past.10/10 hilarious.,0
5,"Very useful piece of technology, and a lot of fun.
  
",12.Sep.19,Yes,"I am really enjoying this new piece of technology and was glad I only paid $ 20.00 for it when it came down in price as well as on a gift card that I build up the value on in another program, which essentially made this Echo Dot free to me.  I have a plug in that I plug into my lamp and have it setup to turn on and shut off by voice or can set a schedule for waking me up in the morning when I go to work. Also works great when I ask Alexa the time or weather or flash briefing or anything else I want to know.  It can also play music from other apps including Amazon Music (which I don't have) but there are other free options other than Amazon Music like TuneIn Radio.  I tried to make a phone call to my cell phone, but it did not work.  I had my phone in front of me when I called me cell phone.  It did not ring the cell phone, but it did leave a message.  To avoid having Alexa calling and leaving messages to your contacts, I just put the Alexa app on my tablet that has no contacts on it.  I am sure I will find more uses for it when I move out of my current living situation.  As I was making this video, Alexa turned on and off my light as I was replaying my video back on my phone.  A very enjoyable toy and newly piece of technology for me and I really love it.  That is why I am giving this a 5 star rating. I am sure you will all enjoy it as much as I do.  If I could add something to this Echo Dot, I would give Echo Dot the ability to upload an alarm sound from my tablet to my Echo Dot for my morning alarm like Star Trek Red Alert, because I am not happy with what few alarms you can use for a morning wake up alarm.",0
5,"I love Alexa !
  
",12.Sep.19,Yes,So I bought this for my bedroom. I already have two Alex is in my house. So between the other two.  Three we_e just too much.  So I gave this one to my nephew. And I only does he love it the whole entire family loves it.  I_ a huge fan of Alexa. I got one years and years ago when she first came out. Alexa does so many amazing things and she makes life so much easier. From timer to alarm to music shopping list and that_ just the tip of the iceberg,0
5,"Cool, Useful Device
  
",12.Sep.19,Yes,"I love the Echo Dot. The functionality is quite good, it works most of the time, it's small and unobtrusive and, for the price, it's a great purchase. As I add more devices to  my home that can be controlled by the Dot, its value will only grow. My only complaint is that the Sonos Skill (which was the main reason I originally bought the Dot) is lousy and plain doesn't work. I also have some minor privacy concerns, but that's not a big issue for me. Overall, I'm very happy with the Dot.",0
5,"Incredible technology. Bright future ahead
  
",12.Sep.19,Yes,"It has so much it can do, but hard to fully utilize all that power. It may just take time, but already very useful. You can ask it what's the weather for any city and it will answer. I ask it every morning when's sunrise; so I can time my morning walk. I also use it a lot to just add shopping or to do items while I'm getting up in the morning. I just shout out, it listens, no typing. Then at the store I just bring up my list on my phone.",0
5,"Love my echo
  
",12.Sep.19,Yes,"Love my Echo Dot, this one was placed in our bedroom since we already have an echo in our living room. It makes it easy to turn off our living room lights from the bedroom using Alexa. It_ also great because I can play music on this as well as my echo and have music playing in the entire house at the same time. It also comes in handy for when I_ trying to go to bed I can have Alexa set my alarm clock for me. Love my actual products and plan on getting more for my bedrooms",0
4,"I didn't think I would ever use this...
  
",13.Sep.19,Yes,"I got this 3rd gen Echo dot only because it came bundled with a Ring security camera. I didn't think I would ever use this as I'm not a big gadget person... HOWEVER.... I'm finding myself using this everyday. I use it to control the tv, turning lights on and off, listening to music, books (when having trouble sleeping) and even for corny but cute jokes. I wouldn't buy this just to have it but I have to admit it is somewhat convenient to have around. It would be more useful if I decide to add more devices in the future.",0
5,"Really handy device.
  
",13.Sep.19,Yes,I love the Echo Dot. This device can be so useful for setting reminders and alarms and reminding me to buy things etc. You can also have it play music and tell you things you want to know and the weather etc. It can literally do anything. They even have a microwave with Alexa built in if that tells you anything. You can just be like Alexa heat my food for 1 minute and BOOM! Done.,0
3,"Kinda weak in the knowledge dept
  
",14.Sep.19,Yes,"""Skills"" are like apps for this little bezos object. Either I am unclued as how to harness the echo's power or there is little there to harness. Weather reports, traffic update are ok.  I LOATHE asking for a subtle seaside sound machine to play only to loudly pitched an 'up-sell' from the alexa inside.  When trying to rest - I do not want to get into a lengthy ad description of a 'skill' for sale.  At all.  Yuck.The unit itself sounds good enough when playing Spotify.  It has difficulty hearing over some music and will require users to shout - I know - my neighbor routinely barks at her echo unit and sometimes it's  laugh.  Most times not. Echo is best placed out in an open area or it goes deaf altogether.A simple answer I wish I could get:  What network is carrying my NFL team's next game.  Easily accessible info that echo can't report.I wish I could have done a home test side-by-side with the google mini but I ain't got that kind of disposable dough.For now the dot makes it easy to yell out my lights and check to see if it's raining even though I have a window.",0
2,"In general comment about all Alexia products
  
",14.Sep.19,Yes,"I've purchases numerous Alexia devices/models over the years.  Some for personal use and others as gifts.  In short...they are great for knowing the date or time and limited easy requested music listening.  However, in terms of over-all ease of use...they fall far..far..far from being called smart devices.  Most of what you would think you can ask, can't be answered by Alexia.  Over time, this issue gets to be very frustrating and a waist of time &amp; effort.  In fact, it's like trying to have an adult conversation with an toddler.  I think you get my point.  So, if you plan on doing some heavy duty music request(s) or serious educational inquiries....you're probably much better off trying Goggle Home Assist or Apple smart devices.  Al least until Amazon decides that it's time for Alexia to advance beyond the first grade!",0
5,"Love Alexa
  
",14.Sep.19,Yes,We love Alexa!  I'm sure there are lots of things that we will be able to do with it as time goes on.  I have watched many Youtube's to get ideas.We purchased this one on Amazon's Prime special day as a Christmas gift for our aunt/uncle that are in their 80's.  They get a great kick out of watching us use ours and I know they're going to have lots of fun with it.  My uncle at 88 refuses to learn how to use a computer but is always asking his wife to look things up.  This will let him do his own look ups without her help.One of the fun things that we use ours for is to start our day with the weather forecast and calendar update.  It then plays our local VT radio station for us here in Florida.I wish I had ordered a couple more of these for gifts.  Black Friday!!,0
5,"Mixed Review
  
",14.Sep.19,Yes,"Purchased three and my teenage son loves it uses it for multiple purposes, my teenage daughter sort of uses it and I have one but most of the time to turn on or off my bedroom lights. Not sure because we have three I had to use a slightly alternative way to command the turning off of the lights.  We also had to name each one a different name. Echo only provides four name choices which sucks. The choices are Alexa, echo, Amazon or computer. I ended up with Amazon certainly no one wanted computer. They need more choices or ability to create your own name.",0
5,"I Love My Alexas
  
",14.Sep.19,Yes,"This was my 4th one. Now we have Alexas in multiple rooms and I can get her to help me any time. This new design, with the fancy cover is cool. But I would take Alexa in any format. We use her all the time. She gives us weather, movie/show trivia, spells for us, does addition/subtraction/multiplication when I need it, does conversions. And she plays music as needed. She does so much more. I just need to take time to figure it all out.",0
5,"What a difference from the older version
  
",14.Sep.19,Yes,We had picked up second generation as soon as they came out. We also have a Google mini and love going between the two to see which one's better. The primary complaint what's the quality of sound where the Google beat hands down. Finally decided to try this new 3rd generation and wow what a difference insound. Thank goodness because we no longer have to use an external Bluetooth speaker to play music through Alexa.,0
4,"Fun and very useful!
  
",14.Sep.19,Yes,"My siblings and I LOVE using the echo dot. We play it_ fun mini games and use it to play music (connected to Apple Music). We have fun asking Alexa numerous questions. I even use it while cooking for quick measurement conversions. I set reminders on it when I need something in the moment but will surely forget. The sound quality is amazing. The only thing that I would suggest would be to work on its voice recognition. I don_ have an accent and my voice isn_ deep. I don_ mumble or shout. Sometimes it doesn_ recognize words that I say and I end up repeating myself twice. But it doesn_ happen a lot, so I still enjoy this!",0
1,"Stopped working after a few months, spinning blue circle and unresponsive.
  
",14.Sep.19,Yes,I purchased my Echo Dot in Jan 2019. It worked fairly well (I was disappointed that it would not play my Apple iPhone podcasts) until all of the sudden at 6 months it just stopped -  only a continue blue spinning circle but no response.  The instructions said to hold down a button on top until the orange light reappeared. Nothing. And no other options. So a waste. I loved the voice activation but 6 months of being operational? So I was out of warranty by the time I got around to calling tech support but to their credit they did try to help with over over an hour of trying everyone had already tried to reset the darn thing. They sent out a new plug to see if that might help. Still just an endlessly spinning blue circle. So overall I would have to say it was a wasted $50. For very limited use.,0
4,"Oh it's good GOOD
  
",14.Sep.19,Yes,"Firstly, I wish Alexa could do web searches. And not like a Google home but at least basic things. Anyways it has good bass but I wish the volume could be louder. You can't hear it from another room. But you can talk to Alexa from another room. There's alot to do with Alexa it's just finding it. The Alexa app is a problem though. Alot of the times I have to keep reconnecting Alexa. Only thing I say you probably need the app for is the skills. Other than that the app is useless.And I don't know if it's the Alexa itself or the Amazon music app but I can't play music from the music app to my Alexa. I used to be able to but now it won't connect.",0
5,"Vast array of knowledge and great family fun
  
",14.Sep.19,Yes,"My family and I absolutely love these new Echo devices. We have never had an Alexa product before, first time, and we are in love. We are a huge sci-fi Fanatics and when we found out that this little dot has Star Trek commands we were all overwhelmed with joy and laughter!! The games and vast knowledge that she provides for my children has been a huge enjoyment as well.",0
2,"Meh
  
",15.Sep.19,Yes,"This was free through Sirius. I like how it feels, sturdy and eell made. Just not a fan of the idea of this. I don't prefer the microphone due to privacy concerns so will not be using this for anything other than a bluetooth speaker. It really needs to not talk to me everytime I turn it on saying its not wifi connected since it never will be.As a speaker it is very lackluster, very little bass and volume. The good thing is that on the right surface it vibrates through and feels louder. Maybe I'll sell it or give it away.",0
5,"Way better sound quality than the previous generation dots
  
",15.Sep.19,Yes,"I own the Gen 1, Gen 2, and now a Gen 3 Echo Dot. The sound quality of the 3 is vastly better than the previous generations. So much that I want to swap all my dots to Gen 3. Maybe even Gen 4 when Amazon announces new Alexa devices on Sept 25th, 2019.My only gripe is that the Gen 3 seems to lag a bit when you ask for some things. She will wake up immediately with the wake word, but while she is thinking or processing the request, the ring turns off. Specifically when asking for a light to be turned on or off.",0
3,"This Alexa is either possessed or is modeled after an 85 year old w dementia &amp; hearing problems!
  
",15.Sep.19,Yes,"My Alexa constantly seems to rarely hear me correctly, answers the wrong questions, sometimes doesn_ hear me at all when I say her name repeatedly,, shuts off or changes songs for absolutely no reason...  this happens so often I find myself asking Alexa _hat happened (to which she doesn_ know), or, if I_ getting really mad, I_l ask _re you stupid?! (to which she literally shuts herself off lol)... She in fact just told me _ don_ know that One and I_ literally just sitting here not speaking.  I had the very first Alexa and it was great, only thing better about this one is it gets louder. I find myself shouting her name so often my neighbors probably think my lovers name is Alexa, or perhaps the name of my disobedient dog!",0
5,"The very impressive 3rd gen Echo Dot
  
",15.Sep.19,Yes,"I have had and enjoyed an Alexa Echo 2G5 which is stationed in my living room for over a year now, and have thoroughly enjoyed its features and functions. I love the fact that she is always learning and expanding her capabilities to enhance my experience. That is why I did not hesitate to purchase this 3rd gen Echo dot for my bedroom. I use it to control my lights, play music and even set a sleep timer to play nature sounds to help me fall asleep at night. It was very easy to install, being pretty much plug and play, and once connected to my WiFi router, all was up and running smoothly! This Echo dot I feel was a great deal for the surprisingly low cost considering its abilities and I highly recommend it to anyone considering upgrading their tech in their home to make life more entertaining and easier.",0
2,"The show version is better dont waste your money on this one
  
",15.Sep.19,Yes,The show is obviously a much better choice. This one is glitchy and i think the price tells you why. If your listening to sleep sounds this one will shut off after about  45 minutes and wont stay going all night. The show does this one shuts off you streaming music after an hour on its own. The show doesnt. The thing i dont like most is you have to say things exactly right or she doesnt know ehat your wanting. Example if you want her to stop playing a sound you say alexa stop playing that sound or song. She wont get it you just have to say alexa stop. Its all in the details as to how you tell her sonething.,0
5,"It's fast, good voice recognition and is most excellent for feeding a stereo system.
  
",16.Sep.19,Yes,"Update:  I got a second DOT 3 so I can control the AMAZON Microwave in the kitchen without having to yell at the ECHO in the breakfast room.  It's performing that function like a champ as well as filling in a music/radio gap in the kitchen.I bought the DOT 3 to stream Amazon music to a mini-amp driving shelf speakers using a MP3 cable and it works great for that as well as answering my dumb questions, like ""What did I come into this garage for?"".I also have a mechanical A/B switch to connect the mini-amp to a Bluetooth receiver to play CDs from my Windows device.My experience with the little DOT 3 will begot a children's version for my 4yo grandson.If he winds up going to Berkley, I'm going to ax for my money back!",0
5,"Echo Dot is great!
  
",16.Sep.19,Yes,"I use the Echo Dot in the bedroom as my alarm, play music and ask general questions.  I first bought the Alexa tower and enjoyed it so much that I ordered the Echo Dot.  If I had known that the sound quality was so good on the Echo Dot, I would not have spent the extra $$ for the tower.  I have detected no difference in the sound quality between the two.  I will be ordered a few more Dots as Christmas gifts.  I really enjoy playing the question of the day and other games.  Excellent product at a very reasonable price.  Highly recommend the Echo Dot 3rd Generation.",0
5,"Amazing
  
",16.Sep.19,Yes,"Started out with Google Home but had too many connection issues so got me one these to try out. All it took was unboxing and holding it to realize how much better the quality was than my Google Home Mini. Alexa is far more capable than Google Assistant, and works so much better. I can literally tell Alexa to start my car. Speaker is better than even the big Google Home speaker and a lot louder. Love the Drop in feature and the ability to arm my home so it listens for breaking glass or smoke alarms.",0
5,"Love echo products!
  
",16.Sep.19,Yes,"I have many amazon devices but this was my first dot, I bought it to use in my bedroom and absolutely love it. Very easy to set up and integrate with my other devices from the Alexa app. The sound quality is great, I_ actually surprised how loud this little guy can get, it fills up my entire second floor when I play music. Exactly what I was looking for to add to my amazon family.",0
4,"Great Speaker.  More Than 1 = Intercom System.  Use Different Names in Rooms That are Close.
  
",17.Sep.19,Yes,"Update:  I ordered yet another one.  I now have a total of 3 Dots in my house.  I have 1 older one in the basement and the 2 newer ones are on the first floor in the kitchen and living room.I did order holders for both new Dots.  The holder helps keep the cord tidy and just mounts the Dots to the wall using the outlet.The sound quality is definitely better with this version, as oppose to my older one.I like the Dots, but sometimes it doesn't always do what I ask.  Also, the newest 1 will sometimes just randomly stop playing music.  I don't know if this is a Dot issue or if there was an interruption in the Wi-Fi.Now that I have more than 1 Dot, I gave them different names (wake word).  I did this by using the Alexa app.  There are 4 different names/wake words that can be used (ie; Alexa, Echo, Amazon, or Computer).  I chose to do different names for the livingroom &amp; kitchen because sometimes when asking 1 specific Dot a question,  the other room's would activate instead.  Different names solved that issue.Overall I'm still pleased with my Dots and will probably pick up 1 or 2 more when they go on sale again.I ordered this 3rd gen Echo Dot and I already had an older  Echo Dot.They both synced up easy with the Alexa app.  I can now use the Dots like intercoms with my kids, using the ""drop-in"" feature.  I think that's neat, my kids... not so much, haha.This 3rd gen Dot does have a better quality speaker.I don't like that the plug is attached to the power cord on the 3rd gen Dots.  My older Dot had a USB cord that plugged into the plug.  That way you could plug the dot into any USB power supply.Overall I'm happy with my newest Dot.  I plan on eventually buying a couple more to place throughout the house.",2
4,"Surprisingly good value
  
",17.Sep.19,Yes,"I'm in the Apple ecosystem and it was my first time with Alexa and I was really impressed. First off, I'm using it in the UAE and do not have full Alexa support. I had to use 3rd party software to set it up and it was quite a tedious procedure. And without the Alexa app I cannot access all of the functionalities. But despite those inconveniences, I'm impressed with how Alexa understands and responds to commands, as well as the variety of skills including games and quizzes which my family loves. The speaker quality is also surprisingly good for the price - almost as good as my UE wonderboom. All that for less than 50USD. I'm almost tempted to get another one.",0
1,"Stop spamming me!
  
",18.Sep.19,Yes,"Amazon really knows how to screw a good thing up. Older version seems to work fine next generation is just awful. I have to ask it multiple times to do the simplest tasks like play music. It will randomly stop playing music for no reason and when I ask it to stop playing music it will just start playing music randomly a few minutes later. I asked for news it gets me whether I asked for whether it plays music I will ask you the same question five times and it will do four different things. Absolute garbage! Edit: did you know that if you leave a bad review for an Amazon product they start blowing up your phone at work and spamming you with unsolicited calls? Loose my number idiots! You made a crap product stop trying to put that on me! Horrible experience with the Amazon tablet as well. Same thing happened, I try to return it and they just make it so difficult and spam you all week. They act like it's operator error, but it is their products that are deficient.",0
3,"Disappointed
  
",18.Sep.19,Yes,I was really excited about getting this. Both my daughter have one and they love it. So I bought one for myself and absolutely loved it... problem being... at just after the 90 day warranty it started only working here and there. Ask it to play music and after about 2 to 3 songs it stops RIGHT in the middle of a song. Then you give it a new command and you get nothing. Plug it back in and repeat. I was told it_ out of  warranty and they would give me a $15 dollar off my next one if I choose to purchase another.  Disappointed in mine to say the least. My daughters are both working well... just bad luck for mine? __ 3 stars because my daughter have had good luck with theirs.,0
5,"I love the new Alexa Dot
  
",18.Sep.19,Yes,"I had the first generation Alexa dot, and I liked it very much. I gave it to my granddaughter and she figured out she could call me on it. She doesn't have a phone. She's only 9. But, this new one, I LOVE! I really appreciate the sound quality. I have played all genres of music on it, and the sound is great. Of course, if you are a purest, I'm sure you could find problems with it. But, for me, and just working around the house, I love the way it sounds. I got the Echo Dot and an Amazon Fire stick in a bundle at Target for around $60 with the discounts. I'm really happy with my purchase!",0
4,"Very good for household use!
  
",18.Sep.19,Yes,I ask Alexa to do quite a few things and this speaker is very helpful. However It would be a major plus if it could be charged and you do not have to leave it plugged in to use it. Also the colors should be differentiated a little further because the rings that show up when something needs attention can be mistaken for another notification. (Lime green and yellow) but instead maybe it should be Yellow and Orange maybe. Other than that I recommend this device for those that don't mind leaving it plugged in to use.,0
5,"Nice price promo on 3 pack for 60 special.
  
",19.Sep.19,Yes,I got a great deal on a three pack of these so I now have them in every room and I_ very happy to have an Alexa in every room of my house even though the Alexa is supposed to be listening to everything you say I don_ really mind too much and it_ a nice thing to have around when you wanna ask a question a player audio game next song quiz even though song quiz tends to get wrong some of your answers and make you lose when you have a good long winning streak it_ still a fun thing to do sometimes I do enjoy having Alexa and all the different rooms of the house and having it locked the door for you or unlock the door for you are setting a timer and various other things so it_ kind of fun to have and I enjoy the little dots even though the big longer one is louder,0
2,"Surprisingly disappointing
  
",19.Sep.19,Yes,"I bought this to replace an old Alexa Echo. My old one never had a problem hearing me. This one requires me to be right next to it when the music is playing and I want to interrupt. My old one kept better track of the songs I ""liked."" I have ""liked"" a song and had it added to my list and then during the same listening session I have ""liked"" the song again and it does not always tell me that similar feedback has already been saved. And there seems to be only one response when I say I like a song. The old one would say, ""Got it"", or ""That will help me play more of the good stuff."" It did not cut off songs before the end of the song was finished playing, bit this one frequently does. And it stops playing altogether sometimes even though I didn't ask it to. And I do not remember hearing, ""Hmm, I'm not sure"" as much as I do now. I have enjoyed asking for certain kinds of music or particular songs, but I am disappointed at how specific I must be. I asked to play Kasey Musgraves Christmas music and I kept getting holiday classics. When I finally looked up the name of Kasey's Christmas album and asked to hear it, THEN I could hear those songs.",0
5,"Finally got a smart speaker, and it's pretty cool actually
  
",19.Sep.19,Yes,"Held off for as long as we could, but had a Prime Day special on these so got one...  Pretty nice to be able to request music anytime, and generally ask the thing questions.  Decent built-in speaker, but have plugged in to external for better quality.  For the privacy concerned, we do regularly mute it unless we know we're going to be requesting things, but reality is -- we've got no privacy these days, unless you go completely analog and off the grid...",0
5,"Awesome
  
",20.Sep.19,Yes,"I bought two to connect my house with my alarm clock and security system.  Everything integrates ridiculously easy (As soon as I plugged these babies in, they got picked up by my network (Phone) right away.  Just clicked the pop up on my phone and they set up within SECONDS - Understand, I had already set up my main hub (Alarmclock) so the network was put together (That took like 10 min tops) already. Either way, it is fast to add a new device.  They are really well made and look very nice.  They do flash a light when they sense you are in the room, so if you dont want that just tell Alexa, Stop blinking and she will no longer flash the colored ring light. I would buy more if I had more rooms.P.s. They give discounts if you buy more than one at a time (Saved 20$ when I bought two).",0
5,"Awesome sound!
  
",20.Sep.19,Yes,"I have always been ""frugal"", I dont always pay top price (usually closer to paying the least) and then I am disappointed with the quality (I know, you get what you pay for!) Well let me tell you how surprised I was at the great sound this little thing puts out! I use it mostly for music and LOVE the sound. I know Alexa can help me with so much more but have not ""talked"" to her much.  If this was only a speaker, I would be so very happy with my purchase and yet there is way more this can do.  I have a Google at home and really like the sound out of the Dot more",0

",21.Sep.19,Yes,"The Echo Dot 3rd generation speaker is a significant improvement over the prior generation speaker. The speaker itself is slightly larger than the prior version wrapped in a grey fabric. The sound quality and voice recognition are significantly improved. Music sounds louder, richer and clear. You can pair another Echo Dot for stereo sound although you won't get a Sono's or Bose experience, yet the speakers sounds pretty good for such a compact size. The connection is pretty flawless with the Alexa App.  Overall an improvement over the previous model.",0
3,"It's Big, Heavy and Its Wood...
  
",21.Sep.19,Yes,"They made it use a different power supply, because the 2nd generation was being used everywhere. I don't think its as good at voice recognition, but it sounds little better. Having stereo is nice, there's two 3rd gens in the room now.  There's not a lot more to say, everyone has one of these things. Alexa gets better, sometimes it amazes but most of the time it annoys.  Lower your expectations.",0
5,"Alexa is now my best friend.
  
",22.Sep.19,Yes,"I did a LOT of research on an affordable option for a virtual assistant. This one's biggest review downfall online is sound quality. I don't understand this. The sound quality is great. These reviews were mostly made by men, and for some reason, men thing the louder the better. Makes for a lot of disappointed women, but I digress. The sound quality is great. It's not a Bose stereo system, but that's not what I want in a virtual assistant.I want my virtual assistant to remind my son of his morning routine. Wake up, get in the shower, get out of the shower, get dressed, eat breakfast, grab your lunch, get your backpack, don't forget your homework, don't forget your phone, leave now so you don't miss your bus. And, he does it! Without attitude! I bought myself 45 minutes in my morning, I don't have to argue with my child ruining his self esteem for the day and making me feel guilty all day. We get to have a fun, peaceful morning, and leave for the day still liking each other!It's also great for the five million timers I have to set when cooking so all my is ready at the exact time and served hot.I say, ""Good morning, Alexa."" And I have it set to play the opening song of The Lion King.She reminds me of my calendar events, doctor's appointments, etc. I have meditation and yoga set for a certain time every morning.I can speak to my son through the device while I am walking around the block. He's 12, not 2.It's great.",0
4,"Very convenient fun to use
  
",22.Sep.19,Yes,This is pretty great as a mini speaker. I bought it expecting the speaker aspect to only work in my room but if I use it on max volume than I can hear it in the living room of my tiny apartment as well. I like the convenience of being able to get it to work just by saying Alexa. One thing though is that I moved it from my moms house to my apartment in another county but I cannot for the life of me get it to recognize that the location is different. So I have to ask what's the weather like in __ otherwise it'll give me the wheather where I used to live. Also I really wish that it had an internal battery storage so that I could move it between rooms. It doesnt work unless its plugged in and the cord is pretty small. If it could be carried around than I could use in in another location for an hour or two before bringing it back to be plugged in.,0
4,"Surprisingly not as good as the previous generation echo dot
  
",22.Sep.19,Yes,"I don't know what's different about this echo dot but I expected superior voice recognition and function. Instead, I have to speak more loudly and be closer to the unit for it to perceive what I'm saying unlike my previous echo dots (main reason for the four stars instead of five). The sound quality isn't quite as good, but again, not sure how the cloth-like exterior affects the dot. I don't hate it, but it's not better than the previous generation (at least not the one I received) I got it for a good price and it was shipped promptly.",0
3,"Great sound but doesn_ like corners
  
",22.Sep.19,Yes,"This little device sounds great. Two recommendations for improving functionality. The mic isn_ as receptive when device is in a corner. I wish there was a way to adjust input sensitivity to address this. So, you may be yelling to get it_ attention if you_e around the corner from it. Related to this, unlike the Fire TV Cube, there are no audio tones from the device to let you know that it recognized your commands. So, unless you_e looking at it_ LED light effects for a confirmation that it can hear you, you_l have to assume this.",0
5,"Love this thing
  
",22.Sep.19,Yes,"I have had my dot for a couple of weeks and I love it. I had a Google Home Mini that I like but couldn't use with my Apple music. Last week I switched from Apple music to Amazon Music HD and love it 1000 times more. I am falling out of love with Apple, anyway I got the dot so I could play my Amazon music on it and moved my Google mini to my office. I realize the sound is not stereo quality. If I want that I was my Beats headphones. It works though for music in the background while I am working around the house.",0
4,"Alexa is always ready and willing to help you out.
  
",22.Sep.19,Yes,"I_e had  the Dot for a month now and love it. It_ very responsive and learns more about your preferences the more you use it. My reason for trying it was for my 90yr old mom who could just ask to call me wherever I was. Outside, another room, napping etc. Being her only caregiver it gave me a peace otherwise I wouldn_ have. Helping her to turn on/off lights, music and so much more. I_ having so much fun learning more options and I_ not all that tech smart to boot!! Blends well anywhere, if needed can be moved anywhere in your home. Love, love, love it.  Thanks Amazon for this irreplaceable item. Good job ___",0
5,"Great new look with improved sound quality
  
",23.Sep.19,Yes,"I've owned each generation of Echo dot, and while I loved the 1st gen physical volume ring design, I found the 2nd gen too cheaply made to buy more than one. When I got this 3rd gen, I was pleasantly surprised by the new design that's aesthetically pleasing, improves the look of the light ring, and dramatically improves sound quality (though it is bigger). Even just voices (Alexa or audio books) sound noticeably fuller through this speaker, and I bet a lot of folks will enjoy listening to music on it, which was pretty rough on the older gen dots.My only real grip at this point is that the feature that determines which echo device should respond gets it wrong most of the time (so the echo in the next room over responds often). I'm sure it's hard!",0
4,"Is there an Echo in here?
  
",23.Sep.19,Yes,"I purchased one for MBR and one for LR.  New to these type of products. I would like to find one resource that has everything about the Echo's capabilities, rather than get random emails. Also, I'm not so well versed in this type of equipment so I really need it spelled out for me.  Easy to install. Still learning how to use it.  It is satisfactory for my use so far, but I would like to know what capabilities this has so I can use it even more. Getting tired of responses that Alexa can't answer for simple questions. Don't know if it's a setting...",0
5,"Such a cool idea .  Your going to wonder How did i live without this
  
",23.Sep.19,Yes,One of the best things i have done.. In some time.! I ordered the Alexa Echo for the living room and new Echo has a woofer and a tweeter (sounds Great) but wanted two woofers so i ordered the Dot (Dot only has a woofer)for the Master bedroom  ..My thinking was i will have great music using my wifi.. Well now i wonder how come i didn't have this years ago...Alexa does so much to help me its unreal and once UPS bring it to your door just call Amazon and in a minute your all setup and it so easy and cool.. Alexa is so nice to me and a huge help.. Always says such smart and nice stuff... Got to love it Music Quality with both playing at the same time is outstanding  and Prime has a great and huge amount of music..,0
5,"Excellent!
  
",23.Sep.19,Yes,"This little echo dot is cool. Surprisingly enough, the sound quality is pretty good for a speaker this size. All the reviews that say ""it lacks bass"", duh, it's got bass but it was never meant to try and compete with other blue tooth speakers designed only for music. If was, the dot would be a lot more than 50.00. I love mine and am going to get a second one.",1
1,"Stopped Working After Only a Few Months!!
  
",23.Sep.19,Yes,"The echo was a nice addition to our Alexa devices in our home. We currently have 3 fire tv cubes with Alexa, and one Echo 3rd generation. We bought this one to pair with our Alexa Clock. It worked for a few months and now is a DUD. Tried resetting it and re-syncing it. It has sound after some resets and then none after others. When it does have volume it is extremely muffled and incoherent. Going to try to return... I do not recommend buying the dot. We have not experienced issues with the other Alexa devices.",0
5,"One powerful little nugget
  
",23.Sep.19,Yes,"I love that this is so weighty and sturdy.  The sound get's nice and loud and clear.  It's the perfect color so it's not hard to find.  The button's are clearly marked which I love.  Blends in with my room's theme perfectly. I just got it yesterday so more to be disclosed.UpdateI loved it so much I bought another for my relative, and she couldn't be happier.  Looking forward to shopping for a nice holster for the walls.  Not just yet, but we'll see what happens.",0
5,"Better than 1st edition I had
  
",23.Sep.19,Yes,"The new Dot is a little more pleasing to the eye and sounds a heck of a lot better as a music speaker, which is all I use it for. It's not the best speaker in the world but as a little desktop speaker, it's great. Love the improved bass and overall sound.",1
4,"Monthly fees?? What is that all about?
  
",24.Sep.19,Yes,"I like this product reasonably well for what I am intending to use it for.  I do not anticipate connecting my entire life to the thing at this point, but music, timer, phone calls are all on the docket.  I don_ know whether or not to be concerned about the _istening ability of this device, but then again I am happy to let anyone listening know what I think on virtually any topic, so do your worst.  The only drawback on the music is that much of what I would like to hear requires joining Apple Music, or whatever they call it, for a monthly fee, and I am not going down that rabbit hole.  As with most of my technology gadgets, I probably won_ live long enough to figure it all out, but so be it.  For the price this puppy delivers good sound and that_ about all one can ask these days.",1
4,"Quality product.
  
",24.Sep.19,Yes,"Liked this so much I bought another for my home office. Voice recognition works very well.Can't believe the sound is so good. The one in our family room you can listen to music through and it sounds pretty clear. My home office is much smaller so I am interested to hear what it sounds like when I am in there.My son was considering the Apple product (we use Apple products for cells, tablets, laptops, earpods, and watches), but I think he is going to give the Echo a dot. Much less expensive and works great.",0
5,"Love this technology!
  
",24.Sep.19,Yes,"My three year old walks up to Alexa and asks it to play Baby Shark and other toddler songs all day.  She just loves that it can also read books to her, and I love the shopping lists, reminders, phone calls I can make, and so many other things we use it for.  My teenage even uses it to catch up on his AP History events and get a more rounded view of the events he is studying.  This week it was the French Revolution, Sedition Act, Marbury v Madison and so on.",0
4,"These are great little devices with many uses!
  
",25.Sep.19,Yes,"This is the tenth echo Dot, Spot and Show I have purchased for the home, friends and family.  It has a long way to go to provide a useful tool for quick research, but Amazon is making it better, and it has so many other uses, it is a great device for the home and office.  I would like to have more control on selection of my own wake word, which is currently limited to Amazon, Echo, Computer or Alexa which presents an issue.  Computer is the worst of the wake words.  I never realized how many times the word computer comes up in normal conversation or is said on TV which causes it to wake up and respond to whatever follows the word computer.  Its annoying and funny when it provides random responses to questions that were not asked, or weirdly interrupts the conversation.  Also requires careful phrasing as it often says it does not know the answer or gives a weird random response repeatedly until the Question is perfectly phrased.",0
5,"Amazon does it again!
  
",25.Sep.19,Yes,"I love my Echo Dot!  I had the larger one before (Amazon Alexa, I believe it's called), but I found that one too be too large for my needs, so I replaced it with this adorable little Echo Dot. I love that it's white--it's so sleek, and really blends in with the decor in the room I have it in. I often play my Spotify music through it, and it's SO LOUD. I didn't expect it to be so loud, but wow!  It's really a great tool to have at home to get information from, keep track of things like grocery lists, and to just simply play music. Love it!",0
4,"Fantastic Sound, But Stereo Pair Can Get Buggy
  
",25.Sep.19,Yes,"3rd gen Dot is worlds ahead of its predecessors. This one has good enough sound quality that it doesn't need to be connected to an external (better) speaker.Only con is that I have two 3rd Gen Dots stereo connected, and after a few months they don't work quite right as a pair. Unplugging them and reconnecting them as a pair in the Alexa app fixes it. It's a 5 minute nuisance for months of being able to fall asleep to surround sound ocean noises, so I'm not mad at it.",0
5,"Have multiple in our house
  
",25.Sep.19,Yes,"I have one (1) Echo, one (1) Echo Dot 2nd Gen and two (2) Echo Dot 3rd gen. Comparing Echo Dot 2nd and 3rd gen, the sound on the 3rd gen is so much better! This product regularly goes on sale, and for the price, it is an absolute great product. We are happy with the product.",1
5,"Every home needs one
  
",25.Sep.19,Yes,"I have used the dot for 2 months now. I have it in the dot wall mount(sold separately). Alexa is able to hear me and follow commands from the next room. The dot max volume is pretty loud. The sound quality in the dot is decent, however the wall mount does muffle some of the sounds. I can_ imagine life without my Alexa devices, and having the dot in our bathrooms is an easy way to announce to the house when you need toilet paper, or play music in the shower. Or ask Alexa the time so I_ not late to work. Highly feel everyone needs an echo dot.",0
2,"It's Listening
  
",26.Sep.19,Yes,"I changed the name from Alexa to Echo to avoid it chirping up whenever something close to ""Alexa"" is said. It wouldn't shut up when I was discussing an echocardiogram on the phone. That's a bit alarming to think it listens to conversations but then I checked out the history online and found it listens to WAY more than you think. Like everything. It was fun for awhile playing trivia games but I never connected to every damn thing Amazon wanted me to because of the privacy issue. I finally unplugged it. I use my remote for my tv and the wall switch for my lights.",1
5,"Overall happy and would buy again.
  
",26.Sep.19,Yes,"I bought this after a speaker with Alexa compatibility broke in a power outage. I do like how small this device is because it fits anywhere. I was very impressed with the sound quality too. I do wish that Alexa could learn the correct pronunciation of my name as she called me Stephan instead of Stephene (pronounced Stephanie) but it is ok, I guess it is my nickname. She is still learning as are we. Asking some questions are tricky to get an answer about especially when it comes to cooking. We have asked her about conversions, temps for doneness, and other things where she doesn_ understand what we are asking. I am sure in time we will figure it out. Overall I do love this device as it is great at telling the weather, playing music, and other basic functions and features that I primarily use it for. I am happy with my purchase and would buy another in the future.",0
1,"Useless
  
",26.Sep.19,Yes,Maybe it's me but nowhere in the description did I see it say that this device REQUIRES wi-fi. At first I was mad that it wouldn't talk to me cause I don't have wi-fi but then I thought I could at least use it as a speaker BUT NO - it won't even connect to your phone via bluetooth you HAVE TO have wi-fi. Sorry but that's some bullsh*t this thing is absolutely useless unless you have a wi-fi connection. Thanks for nothing but thanks for my refund though.,0
2,"Maybe I have high expectations
  
",26.Sep.19,Yes,"I_ not sure if my expectations are high, if I have a bad device, or it_ just how it works. It seems the device is very low. It also has a little delay when I make a command. On the google home device, it_ almost right away when I say hey google. I have to repeat myself multiple Times in order for the Alexa device to hear me. Probably not going to use it for anything else but the doorbell.",1
4,"Great device with still room to grow
  
",27.Sep.19,Yes,"We bought the Alexa device so that we would have a music speaker at out house that is easy to use and will increase the amount of time we listen to music. After having it for a few weeks now, we have listened to much more music as a family than we did before purchasing the Alexa. It is also very easy to use, all we do is speak what song we want the device to play. One of the negative sides is that you need some music service subscriptions to be able to play music and sometimes it does not link well and you need to be tech savvy to figure it out. For example, music from Amazon music is played always super easy and without a problem. However, anytime we try to play music from Spotify, it wouldn_ link to the account unless the app is open on my iPad. This may be a quick fix in settings, but I wasn_ able to figure that out yet. Another issue I came across relates to music in foreign languages. I feel like I have to speak a song name or artist of a foreign language in an American accent for Alexa to understand what I am saying. Foreign language voice recognition can be a great area of growth.",0
3,"Hope it gets better
  
",27.Sep.19,Yes,"Kind of cool but also very annoying. Doesn't work right half the time. If you're power goes out randomly at night, Alexa resets and turns all the lights on. For being so smart this device lacks a lot of simple things, like the ability to sense power surges or listen to clearly spoken words. Yell her to turn off my TV and the device is not working properly, check your power supply. Tell her to turn of my WINDOW and she powers down the TV. AMAZON, y'all sold this? Works to tell the weather, play music, and work the lights in the house (sometimes). Wish I would have bought 1 not 4. I thought they would be better than this. A $50 dollar tablet can tell me the weather and play music plus some. Hopefully Alexa will get better. I'm considering taking mine offline and selling them. Time will tell but lately I've been SUPER DISAPPOINTED with my Alexa.  Especially with the power outage situation. If I were Amazon I'd work at fixing the current bugs in Alexa more so than focusing on making it talk like Samuel Jackson or other stuff.",0
5,"A step up from 2nd generation
  
",27.Sep.19,Yes,"From the appearance to the quality of the speaker this Dot is a step up from previous generations.  Alexa is Alexa, and will be even with Samuel L. Jackson's voice, and she can get pretty confused sometimes.  I like the new finishes for the DOTs, the different fabrics allow you to chose the one that fits the room better than just a shiny black circle.  The speaker is a better quality, music sounds a lot better.  It helps that I only paid $30.00 or so, and I'll probably pick up another one when the price drops again.Recommended.",0
5,"Love my Echo Dot
  
",27.Sep.19,Yes,"If you are on the fence about buying one, do it now!  I bought one for each of my kids rooms - love it.  I can talk to them straight to their room from any location - no longer having to wait for them to pick up their phone!  I can play music in their room to annoy them if they don't wake up in the morning.  They love it too!  They use it to play, tell jokes, play music (which when they play an annoying song over and over, you have the ability to change the music).  Love the dot.",0
3,"As expected when it works
  
",28.Sep.19,Yes,"I replaced an old Dot with this unit. It has had the sound drop out a couple of times. All of a sudden the light looks like it wants to reply, but it is silent. At least a previously set alarm one off. (I think?)Looking around for solutions there seems to be two fixes.1) power on and off2) reset the unit and reconnect it to the app.Option 1 is annoying. Option 2 is unacceptable if I ever had to do it more than once.As this seems to have been a known problem for over a year, why is there no fix?I have no bluetooth devices connected. My wi-fi works fine on a dozen other items.",0
5,"very good product
  
",29.Sep.19,Yes,"this is a great product! Alexa can answer almost any question! you want to listen to music, Alexa can play it, you want to listen to a podcast, Alexa can play it, are you struggling with your math homework, Alexa can help you! there is so much that Alexa can do!!!!! She can give you cooking recipes, tell you what the weather is, tell you what is happening on mars and soooooooooooooooo much more!!! you having trouble going to sleep? well Alexa can even play calming nighttime music! and yet so much mooooooooooore!!!!!!!! it also comes within two days! and talk about the price! this is  definitely 5 stars and i recommend it to EVERYONE ON EARTH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",0
5,"Was Skeptical at first...but love my Alexa
  
",29.Sep.19,Yes,"I was skeptical and wasn't sure I really needed an Alexa, but have enjoyed her. I love that as I am cooking, and run out of an ingredient or realize that I'm low, I can just say ""Alexa, add ____ to my shopping list."" Then, when I am in the store I can pull up the list and remember what I was running low on. I was terrible about forgetting my hand written list at home. I've used her for a timer or for reminders. I also love that I can announce that I'm on my way home if needed.",0
5,"Great sound.. difficult to pair
  
",29.Sep.19,Yes,"This has great sound.  I use this in my kitchen so I can multi task as well as listen to music while i am cooking and cleaning up.  The sound is great, i have no problem hearing the music from across the room, and the voice commands make it easy to be truly hands free.  Pairing it the first time was a little challenging.. not as intuitive as some of the other blue tooth speakers, but once it was paired, it was well worth the time it took",0
3,"A Caveat or two awaits you
  
",30.Sep.19,Yes,"Be advised hat the more devices you have connectivity to the internet becomes an issue.  I have 4 of these.  When I can stay connected to the internet the Echo Dot is pretty awesome.  Problem right now is that somewhere between the number of smart plugs I have (quite a few, maybe 10) and the number of echo dots (4) I find myself offline, i.e. NOT connected to the internet.  It is ANNOYING to hear the all-to-familiar to me chime, followed by a red halo of light atop Alexa; followed by the also all-to-familiar ""I'm having trouble connecting to the internet.  Check the help section of the Alexa app..."" at which time by now I'm yelling for it to shut up before I can unplug it in order to reboot it in an effort to reconnect to the net.Go to my i-phone to check my network and the scene i the same.  That being a constantly spinning icon trying desperately and taking forever at it to establish a connection to the internet.  The point here is that as I started to say from the beginning the more devices you have the more internet speed is required.  THAT has been my personal experience.I presently have a download speed of only 20Mb.  If all goes well it will be at 4Mb TOMORROW which can't get hee so enough.  I will update this review as soon as I can in case you or anyone else following along here and have the same issue.  If you only have one Echo Dot and maybe 3Smart Plugs 20 Mb download speed should be sufficient.  Finally, so far what I just explained here is not in the Help Section of the Alexa app WHICH incidentally CANNOT  be accessed if you're not connected to the internet.So if you are for example a brainy type or student focused on something and the room begins to lose its light and in an effort to stay focused say 'Alexa, turn on the light,""  you want the light to come on so you can continue on uninterrupted, right?  Good luck with that.  My patience have worn so completely thin from instead of a light coming on but instead hearing the chime; the message etc; they tear easily now. GONE.So hopefully the faster internet speed will remedy my personal nightmare here.  As for the answers to many of the questions asked in the questions section above I'm a little confused because the main issue I have is connectivity issues.  As for giving Alexa different name if they are within earshot of each other:  every now and then I will say; e.g. ""Alexa, turn on the hallway light,"" and Alexa will answer from the other room the she's having trouble connecting to the internet, while the one in the room in which my request originated will turn on the light.To me a lot of all this is pretty intuitive.  If you are the type to have found, let's say earlier versions of MS Windows to be very intuitive your problems will be fewer and you will likely recognize the cause of problems within software apps for the Echo Dot.  I was a lot happier with this before making my house pretty smart and life more convenient WHICH IT WILL BE ONCE I GET THIS F*ING THING TO STAY ONLINE.Again, if you're getting your first one in addition to maybe 3 smart plugs and you have a mere 20Mb download connection you SHOULD be okay and problem free UNTIL you start adding more devices and you most likely will do eventually, little by little or otherwise.  But for starters, like I just said you should be fine with just 1 Echo Dot 3 smart plugs and I will say a minimum 20Mb internet connection.  Me?  Hopefully 40Mb will be enough.  If not, then I will have to go with the max available in my area WHICH is not a whole lot more than 50Mb best I remember Soooooo...Good luck.  It's a cool product and once you are up and running smoothly think 2001 Space Odyssey almost 20 years late.  Seriously.William F. Nappi",0
3,"Not as seamless as hoped, but that_ to be expected
  
",30.Sep.19,Yes,"Was very eager to get these while they were $25, and I_ honestly very glad I didn_ pay full price for them. Don_ get me wrong they_e nice and they get the job done, but I_ constantly having connection problems that I seem to only be able to resolve by unplugging the dot and plugging it back in.I was very eager to get one for my kitchen for list making and timers, and while the list making is fine, by now I can_ stand the timer. I constantly have to yell her name multiple times because most of the time she can_ hear me over the timer sound, or it gets messed up somehow and the timer cuts our communication off.It_ also pretty lame you can only have one Spotify account connected for the whole house. It would be so much nicer if each dot could have its own accounts. It treats the household as if it_ meant to have 2 adults and little kids, not catering very well to a house full of teens/young adults with their own personal stuff.Overall I don_ regret getting them, just wish they worked more seamlessly and were more catering towards households with more than 2 adults. If you aren_ easily frustrated by technology not always listening and you don_ mind only being allowed one profile for apps then there_ not really a reason not to get them.",0
5,"The control center to my HOME
  
",30.Sep.19,Yes,"I don't know how many good things I can say about my Echo Dot. This was the 5th one I've purchased now. They make great gifts. I have them in every room of my home. It integrates so easily through enabling ""skills"" with the VeSync, Sengled Home, and Logitech Harmony hub. I use it with routines such as: ""Alexa, good morning"" --&gt; and it turns on my lamp, under bed lights, and tells me a fact of the day. When I say ""Alexa, bedtime""; she shuts off my TV, turns off all the lights, and turns on my white noise machine. I love that it connects to AppleMusic too and my favorite radio stations. Alexa can pickup my voice from pretty far too.",0
4,"Echo dot 3
  
",1.Oct.19,Yes,"Compared to my gen 1 echo dot.  The driver compared to the older one I also have seems a little deeper.  They do handle bass differently though.  The highs seem muffled in comparison, but what can you expect from a single driver.  Voice recognition works as expected.  Originally i was concerned about both echo dots trying to perform the same task when asked.  Both my systems or not close but living room and kitchen or open concept but it appears the two do not compete against each other.  Not sure what tech is involved in  this but they seem to work fine together.  Now if I could get them to play the same thing at the same time for stereo mode that would be nice.  Maybe it exist but I've yet to find it if it does.",0
3,"Some good some not so good.
  
",1.Oct.19,Yes,The voice recognition is excellent. Alexa_ usefulness is questionable but I_ still in discovery mode. Sound quality is average or less but I_ coming from a background in music and hifi sound. The issue that I find very annoying is that say you ask Alexa to play NPR or classical music on all speakers. Often times on or more of those speakers will play at a greatly reduced volume and telling the speaker to raise the volume or doing so manually will have no result. The only solution seems to be unplugging the speaker to reset it. This happens about every other day. One issue I like but haven_ tested is that the products team up with Ring products to monitor your home.,0
5,"Great imporovement in speaker quality since 2nd gen.
  
",1.Oct.19,Yes,"This generation REALLY improved the speaker quality, now I would definitely recommend it to anyone thinking about getting one. For the price there is really no reason to hesitate. The only real problem I have with these smart devices are the concerns of privacy and security. It is just another point of entry for hackers and a great device for hackers when compromised with it's microphone and generally close proximity to the home owner. Maybe turn the mic off when you aren't using it, which is a great feature.",0

",1.Oct.19,Yes,The echo Dot is a great item and a great gift idea. I'd rebuy the item for a friend as a gift. Because the facts about echo dot is it meet all of your needs it's like having a secretary without anyone else being there. The echo dot is on point responsive and you don't have to repeat as long as you speak clearly I was in my living room and I asked it to play iHeartRadio and it responded to me from all the way in the back of the room. It's just a great buy I would buy it again and I love it thank you Amazon.,0
5,"AHHHMAZING
  
",2.Oct.19,Yes,"I absolutely LOVE my Echo Dot 3Gen. I love all the different task it can do, alarm clock, weather, news, music, just to name a few. There are so many other task that I have yet to explore. The size is perfect for my living room/kitchen (connected), I am able to put it on one of my shelves and it blends in to my decor. It's seriously awesome. The sound quality is great, she (I call her she..) can get pretty loud. Now I'm not talking drop the base loud by any means, but can get up there. I love that you are able to ask her turn it down and she does it. The drop in feature is amazing! I love being able to drop in and check on the pup, or when my Dad is over. I don't have a smart home (yet) so I can't say anything about turning on and off lights, locking doors, alarm setting, etc. BUT one of my friends does and I have to say that the whole smart home feature teaming up with Echo is very impressive and gives people a peace of mind. Love it!",0
5,"Perfect for the shy bladder
  
",2.Oct.19,Yes,"I bought this because my guest bathroom sits uncomfortably close to the kitchen table, where we do most of our entertaining. Sometimes, the food we serve can be a bit spicy. Quests and homeowners alike were nervous going to the bathroom, out of fear that a fart would sneak out, or the inevitable _loop of a turd dropping would echo throughout the kitchen.With this fine Alexa device, we can all pee and poo in comfort. While listening to any music of our choice. A great investment!",0
5,"You will be surprised by engaging this technology
  
",3.Oct.19,Yes,"Entry level introduction to the world of smart technology and voice assistant. Easy to use and you will be surprised that it sound pretty decent. With the advancement of Alexa into all things you might as well embrace it. But really, there are lots of things this is good for that you haven_ thought about.I suggested that a friend with elderly parents who were sickly buy this and set it up in their parent_ home. Then he could check in and they could call him without the need for them to find the phone. LIFE CHANGER! He can drop in on them and see how they are doing and they don_ need to get up and find their phone.",0
4,"Superb Sound Quality, But Still Not Sure the whole purpose of a smart device?
  
",4.Oct.19,Yes,"Received a code for this as part of a promo for a popular service that floats over your head beaming music. Never really been hip to a smart device such as this (Siri and any personal assistant if it's in my phones over the years has been reduced to be a marginally used piece of technology gathering dust in the crannies of my phone)Only lasted a few days before the overwhelming urge to just tuck it back into the box came up. Rather then that, it found it's true calling, going to my next door neighbor. His wife recently had a car accident and has been going through surgeries and healing up.Currently it keeps her company and allows her to enjoy music and have some tasks made easier!With luck her new digital friend keeps her company, and I solved the problem of having it languish in my box of electronic gizmos!Maybe i've blown the chance to yank it out in 50 years and take to a hologram rendered version of the antiques roadshow for big bucks, but better to make someone's life easier!Sound was good, setup was easy, app is flawless but it just doesn't fit into my needs like it does for other folks. And that 's okay! May alexa live long and prosper helping a lady get back on her feet!(Bonus: Shortly after being unwrapped, Junior Rangers Nick Wilde Dropped by to see what the fuss was all about. He thought the same thing, great for others but decided against keeping it because you can't find a outlet in the wilderness most of the time!)",1
5,"It is a great device for mobility and vision-impaired elders. Mama loves her Echo dots
  
",4.Oct.19,Yes,"We bought this for our 95 year old mom who is legally blind and has trouble using the phone or dialing. Now she uses Alexa to set timers. She asks Alexa the time because she can't see a regular clock. she also uses it to have Alexa read her books .  we installed these for security because if she falls she can call through Alexa without having to try and reach a phone. Mama loves Alexa and so do we for the Peace of Mind in fact we're going to buy a total of 4 to have Alexa all through her home to provide security and comfort. We are right next door, and if mama needs us, Alexa can help her call us easily from room in the home. I would highly recommend this for anyone who has a vision-impaired elder or mobility-impaired Elder who may be in need have a voice-activated telephone access. We have to get the dialer to go with it but it's so much more than just a pretty voice.",0
5,"If you have any earlier Dot, just go ahead and upgrade.  This one is worth it.
  
",4.Oct.19,Yes,"I love it!  I just ordered a second one to try out the ""stereo"" feature.  It is so light years ahead in sound quality over the previous generation Dot(s).  I didn't feel the need to connect this to an external speaker at all as it sounds good enough for office or bedroom use as a standalone entertainment unit.  Great voice recognition, easy setup.  I like the way the Dot has evolved, and this one is the first one I would consider usable as a complete standalone unit.  Looks nice, sounds good.  Perfect for a desk or a bedroom.  The only drawback I have is that my cats think this might be a nice thing to scratch due to the cloth covering.  But cats aside, this is a great looking, great performing device.  I can't wait for the next gen.",0
3,"Should've Stuck with my 2nd Gen
  
",4.Oct.19,Yes,I have had sooooooo many issues with this device. I have to unplug it almost everyday because the alarm continues to go off as some sort of defect. I have returned it and got a new replacement and it does the same thing. It also does not effectively work with looping. I use rain sounds to go to sleep and this device will not loop causing me to wake up in the middle of the night super annoying so I had to just create a rain sounds playlist on my apple music to go to sleep to. I just am consistently having an issue with this device. It'll play music when not prompted causing issues with my music on my phone. I have to give commands several times sometimes. I'm just more annoyed than pleased overall.,0
2,"The sound quality is terrible compared to the previous model.
  
",4.Oct.19,Yes,"I upgraded because the old one had trouble hearing my wife_ commands, as she is very soft spoken.Not only did we not see much of an improvement in it_ listening, but the sound it omits is muffed. It sounds just awful composed compared to the older model. There_ almost no treble. It_ all low range, which from such a tiny speaker is pathetic unto itself.This is a downgrade from the prestigious generation in my option.",0
2,"I really want to love it!
  
",4.Oct.19,Yes,"I really want to love this but for some reason every 2-3 days it drops the wifi and wont reconnect without having to reboot from step 1 like it's new out of the box. I've had it for 10days and I'm on the 3rd need for a reboot which im tired of doing.On the plus side, its amazing on the amount of things it can do. My 6yr old loves talking to Alexa and the voice recognition is on point. I seen complaints about the volume level but im impressed with it.I really want to love it!",0
2,"Glitches with pandora
  
",5.Oct.19,Yes,"This is my first smart speaker product, and I_ only leaving a bad review due to the glitch with pandora. I purchased this solely for music in my spa on my pandora subscription, however it skips and then changes the song mid way through EVERY SONG. Super distracting and annoying and almost rendering it unusable for me. Apparently this is a common issue.",2
5,"Buy one! You won't regret it!
  
",5.Oct.19,Yes,"Wasn't as impressed as I thought I would be when we first got it.  Now she is used a lot and have a couple plus the show.I love getting the weather, setting timers  (great for my 3 y.o timeouts) and best of all My shopping list!!!! I'm the type of person that needs a list of my lists!This is just great to tell her as I go, as I run low on something in the kitchen, I'm telling her to add it to my shopping list!",0
3,"Hardest gadget to connect; use alexa.amazon.com instead!
  
",5.Oct.19,Yes,"Connecting this gadget should not need to be so hard! That is why i'm cutting 2 stars. The app didn't work on my phone (Google Pixel 1); it would hang on the screen ""Manually connect to Echo Dot"" after connecting to the Amazon-XXX SSID (even with my phone's Mobile data turned off). I finally had to connect using a Chromebook to alexa.amazon.com before I could configure the Echo's wifi! Come on, Amazon! It took me an hour of googling to get this connected. (Thanks to reddit for the solution!)Everything else about it works perfectly once the setup issue is resolved.",0
4,"Great device for Alexa, not the best to listen to music
  
",5.Oct.19,Yes,"I had two Amazon Echo in France and was very satisfied. I just arrived in the USA and found an interesting discount on the Echo Dot so I did buy two of them!The design of this new Dot is awesome! Alexa works as great as on the Echo (very well!), even when there is some noise.However the sound from the Dot is not as good as the Echo, and that's why I'll probably have to buy an Echo for the living room, or even the new Echo Studio because listening to music is one of my main usage of Alexa.I'll keep the Dot for the garage &amp; the kitchen, to run timers or for home automation!",0
5,"Great for use with a powered speaker
  
",6.Oct.19,Yes,"We have these Alexa/Echo devices throughout the house (probably could use 2-3 more) and so far we have really enjoyed them. I always wanted a whole house speaker system and dreaded having to run wires everywhere or spend thousands of dollars on a wireless speaker system. I had an older powered computer speaker system with powered sub-woofer sitting in a corner and figured I could use that with this small Dot system and it works really great. Yes, there are some significant improvements needed in the Alexa/Echo voice response system, however for basic stuff, it works well. Highly recommend.",0
5,"Great addition for our ""addition""
  
",6.Oct.19,Yes,"I needed to extend my Echo 2nd generations range since we have recently added a new room to our home, quite a distance from where I keep Echo.  I  got a kick out of  telling Alexa to ""Order me a dot"", during the last big Amazon sale. It was so fast to do, and fun to actually have her do it for me!My new dot is wonderful.  It takes up a minimum of space and is perfect for our office addition.  I use both mostly for background music, and my new Dot sounds so similar to my larger Echo, that I forget the music is coming from the newer, smaller model.  I am more than pleased with the Dot.",0
4,"She only recognizes my voice 50% of the time :(
  
",6.Oct.19,Yes,"Alexa has a lot of trouble recognizing my voice. She keeps wanting to call me by my husband's name &amp; we sound NOTHING alike. When I ask her to learn my voice, she says she already knows who I am &amp; names him instead of me. The next time I ask ""who am I?"" she gets it right. We go back &amp; forth..She does a good job of turning lights &amp; gadgets on &amp; off and she plays the music I ask for pretty well. I wish I could ask her to play music for a set amount of time. She doesn't get that yet. Maybe she will improve as more technology is added to her.",0
5,"What do you mean I need a title?
  
",6.Oct.19,Yes,"Honestly I_ very happy with my purchase, I love music so I wanted the echo dot simply to be able to play music. Was told by friends that I should get the echo plus for that but the echo dot had great sound quality for the price even beating some of my friends pricier speakers, the sound volume gets loud but not as high a speaker meant for music only. It_ way easier for me to get the music to play than on a simple speaker because it_ voice command vs selecting on your phone (although you can select from your phone). I can ask it for questions on the go or pause it when my family needs me in a hurry. The Skyrim feature is a hoot, so silly. My only problem is that there_ a weird disconnect between the Alexa app and the amazon music app which confuses it. If you use the voice command to ask it to play music it will play amazon music through the Alexa app. If you want to change the song it_ either voice command or through the Alexa, or an extra prompt through music asking for permission to play over the current song. Also Alexa is extremely forgiving to those with stutters such as myself and quiet voices. It_ a great mic which despite me stuttering or talking quietly, it still delivers exactly what I want. I struggle with Siri and other voice command programs but had no issue with Alexa on the echo dot.",0
5,"Great intro to the Echo product line
  
",6.Oct.19,Yes,"So far, I'm very happy w/my Echo Dot.  The voice recognition is Excellent!  The main reason I got it was for music - linked to my Sirius account &amp; I love it.  The sound quality is good; voice recognition spot on &amp; enjoying the options.  I can see how easy it is to get hooked on using it.  In fact, planning to upgrade my thermostat soon.  I can also see upgrading to add the Echo (better speakers) for the great room &amp; using Dot in other parts of my house.  So far, all Good!",0
1,"Amazon Echo Dot  - Distorted Sound
  
",7.Oct.19,Yes,"I purchased the Echo Dot in March 2019. It worked well for a few weeks then the sound started to degrade. Alexa's voice and any music playing sounded fuzzy and distorted - similar to radio static when a station is not tuned in properly. I tried all the recommended solutions: factory reset of the device, un-registering and re-registering it, resetting my router, downloading the latest software, etc. Nothing worked. At first I thought that maybe the speaker was blown - but sometimes the sound was restored for short periods. I contacted Amazon customer service and they walked me through all of the above mentioned solutions again with no success. The most frustrating part of this adventure is that they notified me that the device was out of warranty. I was expecting them to at least exchange the device for a new functioning one. I expected that it would be warranted for a year minimally. But unfortunately that is not the case, They did offer me a discount on ordering a new device though. TO be fair the Echo Dot is a great little device when it is working. The fact that I received a lemon, combined with a poor warranty policy explains my one-star rating.",0
5,"Alexa is Good
  
",7.Oct.19,Yes,"Vice recognition is very good. Even when other noise is around, once you say ""Alexa!"" your next command is recognized. I find the sound quality is more than acceptable for me. So far integration of other devices is good although I have only added a couple of smart plugs and integrated Spotify with Alexa. I am contemplating purchase of another Echo for upstairs or in the garage.",1
3,"Sounds good. It_ nice looking and it was on sale.
  
",7.Oct.19,Yes,Here_ why I marked it a little less than 5. We bought it to play Spotify. I have amazon music and also and Alexa and 3 dots. We wanted this one specifically for the significant other to use to play Spotify. It says you can but we can_ figure out how no matter how hard we try. So that_ why I didn_ give it 5 stars. Hard to use for anything but Bluetooth and amazon and no we still have no clue how to play Spotify not via Bluetooth so if you do shoot me a message.,0
5,"How in the world did we live without this??
  
",7.Oct.19,Yes,"LOVE this product! Our new stereo, weather forecaster, joke teller, trivia answerer, alarm clock, kitchen timer, kitchen helper, calendar.., how did we get along without one? I just can't even put into words how much we adore it. The speaker is great and I enjoy several hours of music daily.  We are in our late fifties and figured this was something we would never use or want - but after my son bought one for my parents - I was sold!",0
5,"Great addition to my collection.
  
",8.Oct.19,Yes,"The sound and look are updated versus the older versions. They are added very easily to your existing Echo ecosystem and work seamlessly. Control of connected devices works well, although you may need to repeat commands at times.  Using the intercom function is great as I do not need to yell throughout the house to speak with my wife or son, nor do I need to pick up the phone and call either of them.  Their size and look fit well into any decor and they are usually inconspicuous, as most visitors do not initially spot them.",0
5,"I like it even better than the big boy
  
",8.Oct.19,Yes,"I owned the expensive original Echo. Had it 2 or 3 years but it broke. I was leery that the dot wouldn't have good sound quality or be loud enough-wrong! It sounds just like the original at one third the price. Added bonus: it's so small, I can hide it behind a lamp (my wife doesn't like the way any of them look) and it's entirely inconspicuous there, but works great. I keep finding new uses for it all the time - honestly, I wouldn't want to live without one now.",0
3,"Decent device, awful app
  
",9.Oct.19,Yes,"Numerous small issues.When you set a timer, it's local to that device. So if you set a timer in the kitchen for, say, cookies or something, then go to another room, that timer will only go off in the kitchen even if you have an echo dot by your computer.The app is annoying; it needs a ""duplicate routine"" option for if you need to make multiple similar routines. For example, if you make a routine for ""I'm in the den"" which turns off all the lights except the ones in the den, and then you want to make an ""I'm in the living room,"" you can't just copy and edit the first one. You have to set it up from scratch, which in my apartment means setting six individual lights to off and one on. Each of those is selected from a menu, then you set options in sub menus, so something that should take less then a minute ends up taking up to ten. Plus if you accidentally hit ""back"" it drops all progress and starts over. And there's no option to create routines on PC in a browser where it would be more convenient.The echo dot often doesn't understand what I say. Sometimes I have to repeat commands up to three times.Alexa never shuffles playlists when I ask her to play music, which is only a minor annoyance but it's still annoying.There's a ton of potential for this to be awesome in the next generation, but for now it's just okay. The device itself would get another star if the app was better.",0
1,"Amazon......really???
  
",9.Oct.19,Yes,"Called Amazon 4 times within last month for this echo dot and other issues with the 12 devices I've purchased within the last year and roughly 1 month and still have gotten no where!  The dot that just keeps spinning is the replacement Amazon sent me for the defective one I sent back.  Now I've spent hours unplugging, uninstalling, re-installing, deleting groups, re-adding groups etc and still can not get help or devices to do what they were advertised to do!",0
5,"Sound is not as clear as prior generation
  
",9.Oct.19,Yes,"Possibly this is due to their attempt to improve the lower end. Not sure. I do prefer the gen 2 sound over gen 3 Echo Dot. Gen 3 has what I can only describe as a more muffled sound. Other than that, if you like Alexa and need 1 or more extra devices for coverage, the price is usually good on these units. I like having the extra coverage in garage, basement, bathroom, etc. We use larger units in bedroom and kitchen.",0
5,"This Is Our Second Echo Dot
  
",9.Oct.19,Yes,"Loved our first, which is now in the basement with my husband. Felt lonely, so I bought another.  I love listening to music, or audible books when I'm cooking, or knitting/crocheting or sewing.  Unlike radio, there are no ads, no static, and you have more control over what you want to listen to Highly recommend. Most likely will purchase more in the future for other rooms.",0

5,"Great quality speaker, easy to use, love listening to music!
  
",10.Oct.19,Yes,"I love this! Now if you_e like me and mainly using it for music you have to also pay for the amazon music unlimited monthly which was $3.99. It does have to be hooked up to WiFi and download an app on my smart phone. It took me maybe 5 minutes to set up, voice recognition and all. It has a definitively great quality speaker and the volume adjust well. Highly recommend, purchasing another for gifting. My 7 year old daughter enjoys it too. Alexa recognizes all the Disney songs and plays them when asked!",1
5,"I think the Echo Dot is a great little product!!!!
  
",10.Oct.19,Yes,"This summer we purchased the product Ring.com and with our purchase we received the Google Home device.  I have spent way to much time trying to connect this device to my iPad Air and my I phone with no success.  Once again shopping on Amazon, and saw the Echo Dot on sale for $39.99, and thought well why not.  Received it not even 2 hours ago, and I_ all hooked up to my IPad Air and IPhone.  Echo has played the songsI_e requested, watched a show on my iPad, and asked her the temperature outside. Unbelievable how easy the setup and use.  I personally think this little speaker works great for my needs.",0

5,"Great Sound and Function.
  
",10.Oct.19,Yes,This is an awesome entry level Alexa device. My son and family love the sound quality to play music from all providers and the games are cool. Being able to turn lights on and off at night also gives my son piece of mind for bathroom trips in the night. The games you can add like true or false and would you rather are great free addons.,0
5,"I love my Alexa
  
",11.Oct.19,Yes,"I had this product before and had to rebuy it. My wife and I were staying with some people and we used our Alexa everyday we were there. We use it to play music while we are getting ready, rain sounds while we are sleeping, or classical music for our dog Olivia when we are away. Anyway, this family we were staying with never used Alexa before. My wife decided to show them the device and their son really fell in love with it, he's one years old, and he is the reason I need another one. These people were so happy to see their son trying to say Alexa and watching him dance to different songs. My wife offered MY ALEXA to those people, and they accepted! I was so sad to leave her behind. Once we left, I would shout Alexa randomly in my own home and no one answered! I finally demanded that we get another one, so here we are. I will miss Alexa 1 dearly, moral of the story don't let babies near your prized possessions.",2
4,"They still have some work to do with the Echo
  
",11.Oct.19,Yes,"Ok I got the echo basically because I wanted to control my Amazon Fire TV.  I attempted to set it up and downloaded the Alexa app to my iphone 6. It seemed to initially be going well until I tried to pair it, and pair it, and pair it! I gave up and contacted tech support. They went thru the same things I did many times, redoing the setup. After several hours without pairing, they had to contact their tech support. Finally after 9pm I get another call from tech support and they asked me to access the app via my Ipad instead of Iphone. Doing this, it paired just find. For some reason my Iphone 6 didnt connect it. Dont know why, dont care, at least we got that far. Then they ran me thru some simple tests...Alexa turn off the tv...lol nope, didnt respond. Alexa turn on the tv, nope. Alexa open Netflix, nope. Alexa whats the weather ? wow , now yes she answered correctly. Anyway, at one point a tech told me I would need a smart plug to make it work..ok got a smart plug and no, didnt work. So, long story short, Im using the Echo for its general uses, not for a Firetv connection. I do like it, but it doesnt do what I originally wanted it for. Still Im 65, and its kind of cool. Im sure the grandkids will know more about it than Ill ever know.",0
1,"VERY ANNOYING...
  
",11.Oct.19,Yes,"Bought this new unit to go in the living room.  I have one already in my computer room.  Took a long time to get he app to recognize and change the ""Wake up name""..  Then the fun began..  It started announcing ""Good Morning and You've Got Mail"" when I signed on to AOL.  It also informed everyone in my living room when I signed out ""Good Bye"".. Now, today, it started playing any sound made on AOL..  Game background noise, (VERY annoying) and anything I want to listen to on AOL in the computer room is all broadcast to everyone in the living room, LOUDLY.  If this is not bad enough, I have spent hours on several chat sessions with four different people trying to solve this.  The last one, Prabhansh, was chasing me all over.  ""Try this..  Try that..."" An hour with him and he had NO idea what he was doing.  I guess I have to return this and go on EBay and get a 1st generation that works...  SHAME AMAZON....",0

",11.Oct.19,Yes,"I have 2 Echo Dots, one set up in my bedroom and the other in my bathroom. The set up is easy and pretty straightfoward. Sound output is fantastic. There are a few minor issues: 1) Streaming of radio stations or podcasts can easily drop and you need to tell Alexa to restream, 2) no built in back up power (if power goes out, the Dots are useless).  Also, the Alexa app is somewhat not quite intuitive and like most of Amazon interfacing software, its somewhat ""clunky"" and needs a bit of searching.",0

5,"I love the Amazon Echo Dot!
  
",12.Oct.19,Yes,I'm using this product to control by voice my smart home appliances. I like it a lot. The Echo dot recognized my voice pretty well and works fine. I think it works better than the Google Home Mini. I recently changed my two Google Home Minis for two Amazon Echo Dots. And I love it. The Echo is more pretty and faster than the home mini. And the Echo sound is better too. I think it only have two bad points and it's not so bad. That is the assistant use for general queries. Here is where the home mini shines. The Google Assistant do a better job here. And the other is that Alexa can't learn my voice in Spanish. I need that because in this manner I can separate my personal info from my wife info. But in overall I love much more the Echo even the Alexa app it's better and more organized than the Google Home.,1
3,"Watch out for Customer Service.
  
",12.Oct.19,Yes,"I got an echo for my in laws.  I wanted to set it up so that it would play music which, apparently you have to pay to get anything good.  I didn't want them to pay so I called customer service so that they could help me.  Online the woman said I couldn't do it from their home, I had to be at my computer which seemed odd.  None-the-less, I went home and she said that she would talk me through set up.  She didn't.  She instead took control of my computer through rapid fire pressure tactics and then infiltrated my computer.  Just a heads up, there are some criminals working there to steal data.  She moved all my files to the cloud and I had to wipe out my whole computer to regain any control over my mouse.  I am still trying to regain and privatize  my files again.  They still don't have Amazon music.",0

",13.Oct.19,Yes,Fun little toy! Most of the time the echo is great until my youngest son learned to say Alexa. Then it was _lexia fart ever 5 min for the longest time. I know that you can change the name and I have cycled through all of them so many times he can say them all.Just a bit of advice a 1-3 year old will learn anything that can annoy you at an accelerated rate. So think long and hard before you show them how to play a song that you like because they will play that song 9 million times a day! My son has almost ruined _ary on wayward son by Kansas for me and it has always been one of my favorite songs!!,0
5,"Alexa can be your friend too
  
",13.Oct.19,Yes,"We_e had our Echos since Christmas, so when we were going away to visit friends and family for a few days, we thought it would be a nice hostess gift. It was just right. We thought our friends would really enjoy the music function, and that was what they used most often while we were there. When we were with relatives they were having fun using Alexa as a search engine to learn about different things. She_ pretty fast in the search department.The bottom line is whether you_e getting an Echo for yourself or as a gift, you just can't go wrong!",0
2,"Doesn't Work For Me
  
",13.Oct.19,Yes,I was excited about the updated Echo but mine struggles to keep up with the others on the everywhere group and sometimes doesn't start at all.  It randomly answers questions that were not asked and has to be rebooted frequently.  I still have my very first Alexa Echo Device from a couple of years ago and there are no issues so I don't think this device is worth the price for a 9 month use.,0
5,"I love Alexa! Suck it siri!...
  
",13.Oct.19,Yes,"I don't know what I did with my life before Alexa. I use this echo in my bathroom, and it is everything I have ever wanted. I know I am probably not using Alexa to the fullest, but for what I use her for, she's excellent.I just wish the unit listened to more than single commands and didn't require me to say ""Alexa"" before every command. But other than that, I love it!",0
5,"Echo Dot
  
",14.Oct.19,Yes,"I had one and put it in another family members room for inter-room communications.  Works great.  I added this one to my bedroom for a little late night music, news, and super easy to set alarms without jacking with buttons or dials.  Just tell Alexa what time and it's done.  The alarm is plenty loud and you can customize it online.  I customize my news briefs so when I'm waking up in the morning, I can get the latest in news.  Lastly, I just upgraded the TC in the bedroom to a smart UHD TV with WiFi AND Alexa.  Yep, I can use alexa to change channels, volume, watch youtube, or nextflix, etc. with no remote.  So cool.  Love it!",0
5,"WOW! Better than expected
  
",14.Oct.19,Yes,"I love the Echo Dot (Gen 3)! I've never had anything like this, wasn't sure I'd be able to get used to it, but I downloaded the app to my phone, plug in the Echo, told Alexa to play my fav radio station and WHAM, there it was! Sound quality is GREAT! At 50% volume I could hear it loud and clear throughout my apartment. Super easy to set up, only took me about 3 minutes. Been playing with it all night and I love it! Highly recommend it.",0
5,"Best personal electronic assistant out there.
  
",14.Oct.19,Yes,"I cant imagine life without my Echo Dot. It really has helped get my life into order. When I wake up in the morning ""Alexa, start my day"" She gives my the current weather forecast. She keep me up to date on the current news, daily facts as well as traffic information. ..what my commute to works looks like. Truly my best buy of 2019!  I have yet to fully utilize all that Alexa is capable of, but I know that when I do, i will not be disappointed.",0
5,"Three is better than one
  
",14.Oct.19,Yes,"I receive an Echo Dot for my birthday from my son and daughter-in-law. My husband loved being able to choose songs (as did my grandchildren who are here every afternoon.) When they kept choosing songs unavailable, my husband signed us up for Amazon Music. That lead to the idea of surround sound by putting one in our living room to sync with our family room. And then one in our master bedroom upstairs was even better. So now we have surround sound and intercom capabilities without cutting into our walls or ceilings. Very happy!",0
5,"Worth it for the upgrade in sound quality and volume.
  
",15.Oct.19,Yes,"I bought this to replace my Gen 1 Dot. Now it isn't the snazzy new one with the time on the front, but it doesn't matter since I have it hidden behind some things anyway. The sound is so much better than Gen 1! And really that is all I wanted. I wish it was white or sandstone as they call it now. Maybe it was my mistake ordering it or maybe the bundle I got was only for charcoal. Either way, just aesthetics. It works great.",0
5,"Handy
  
",15.Oct.19,Yes,Love this devise! I bought one for my son for xmas last year and have regreted not getting one for myself in the kitchen ever since.  Soooo when they had a deal on it couple weeks ago i scooped one up! Its so handy from something as simple as tell me tje wheather to setting a timmer when baking! Also i easily added the device in my app and i could  set my  devise settings separatly from my sons,0
4,"Great sound quality and WiFi calling functionality.
  
",16.Oct.19,Yes,"Bought this unit as a christmas gift for my parents. They love this device and really enjoy how they can use Alexa to set reminders through the day, check the weather before they leave for work, stream any song they like from Prime Music's large gallery and etc.Another cool feature is that they can call me (to the Alexa ap on my phone) free of charge, without the need for a cellular connection. This is a great feature to have when I'm travelling internationally and want to talk to them. I just have to dial them on the app and I can have a seamless conversation for free.The sound quality on the device is great, as well- the bass is pretty decent for what one would expect from a unit of this size, and if you don't like the sound, you can always connect external speakers to this device over Bluetooth.",0
5,"It's a great product with lots of useful features
  
",16.Oct.19,Yes,"I have 3 3rd Gen Echo Dots in my home.  Master Suite: I use this one for putting me to sleep at night with relaxing music and relaxing sleep sounds, as well as waking me up in the morning.  Alarms are so easy to set and change.  Den: I use this one to control my lamp, as well as my tv and XBOX ONE.  I can turn on the tv, adjust the volume,  and switch the input all using voice commands (my Vizio is Alexa compatible).  I walk into the Den and say ""Alexa Gamer Time"" and my lamp dims to 50%, the tv comes on and switches to the input that my XBOX is plugged in to, and my XBOX comes on.  Ready to go. I also have Alexa play my Audible Books while I am working.  The third one is in my son's room.  He uses it to listen to Pandora and control his lights.It's a great product.",0
5,"I use it more than I thought I would.  I have 3 of them.
  
",17.Oct.19,Yes,"We live in the basement of our office.  We bought the echo's so it was easier to communicate upstairs and down.  I use them for more than I thought I would.  Mainly lists and reminders, timers and alarms.  Music and podcasts.  My only gripe is that I need instructions on how to tie them together.  If the office echo gives a reminder, I would like it to also say it on the kitchen echo.  I'm in my 50's, so my technical abilities are limited, to say the least.  I would say, write the instructions like you are talking to a kindergartener, but I'm sure that a kindergartener knows more than me about these things!!  Just write the instructions like you're talking to a dinosaur.  LOL",0
5,"Convenient sound from tiny speaker
  
",17.Oct.19,Yes,"This is super convenient.  Walk into a room and ask Alexa to play whatever you're feeling like at the moment, and there it is.  The sound is a little bass heavy, surprising from such a tiny speaker, but that is easily correctable.  For background music, the speaker is fine.  For serious listening, I'd want a better speaker.  Installation was easy.  I have an Amazon prime account and mostly listen to Amazon Music, without commercials and no additional cost.  I also listen to Pandora, which has a few commercials when using the free account.",0
5,"Never Thought I'd Like Echo and Alexa So Much!
  
",17.Oct.19,Yes,"Setting up the Echo Dot was much easier than expected and I never thought I'd like having Alexa as much as I do. Discovering Alexa skills has been great with having children in the house. There are so many skills that the kids love from educational trivia quizzes to music they enjoy. The ability to control our thermostats from anywhere is wonderful and we are growing out smart home little by little. Thanks, Alexa!",0
5,"I don_ know why I waited so long to get these?
  
",18.Oct.19,Yes,I wish I hadn_ waited so long to get echos for my children_ bedrooms. It has made our lives so much easier. They set all their own alarms. They love listening to music. And they ask Alexa all kinds of fun and interesting questions. My oldest loves to fall asleep to sleep sounds. And my youngest loves learning about the weather.I don_ know if there are echoes with this feature but I think it would be great if they were able to have mood lighting. It would be utilized as a night light.,0
1,"Alexa is to hard to setup and customer service just keeps hanging up on you.
  
",19.Oct.19,Yes,"I spent 5+ hours trying to set this thing up. 1st as Alexa. I ended up giving up. She keep saying I'm learning or other stupid answers. Then I tried talking her a speaker. She did learn my voice. Couldn't figure it out. I purchased to be a speaker and voice appliance for my firestick.  Then I tried to pair with my fire stick didn't work. Very disappointed. I returned to the store. It's not user friendly at all. My friends even tried.  I am great with computers. It was just to hard to setup or just was to dump. I asked it for help and it would say things like defining ""help"" when I said. Help setting up Alexa with firestick, wtc.. I asked it  to help me connect to the fire stick, setup Alexa, make her a speaker. It didn't understand. the application wasn't helpful AT ALL.  And to thinK I was getting 4 more for my kids at Christmas this was a trial on how it works.  MAJOR FAIL Fail. Not user friendly. To hard. Directions didn't help. Google is so much better AS AN ASSISTANT. It will talk u through setup. Only problem it want connect to Amazon devices. They are not friends with each other. Shame. Customer service want to contact me. That's fine.I TRIED CONTACTING YOU WITH 4 DISCONNECTS. carlahart73@gmail.com. No one else. I HABE A HARD TIME GIVING UP ON DEVICES, BUT THIS WAS A COMPLETE FAIL.  I returned the device today  gave up on customer care.  You just lost a major customer.  Unless your with Amazon r Alexa please don't contract me. If my phone number shows you can call it in case I don't check site. A wouldn't buy item. Love the firestick.",2
5,"Fun and Useful
  
",19.Oct.19,Yes,"Sound quality for this little Dot is pretty awesome.  We've played all kinds of music through SiriusXM and had no problems at all with the sound quality.  Alexa's voice is very clear and there's no problems understanding what she's saying.  So far, I've used it to set alarms, play music, read us stories, ask general questions, turn on lights.  I really wanted to use the ""Drop-In,"" feature connected to another Dot on a second floor (which is on another account) but found out that I have to have a ""mobile phone number"" which I don't have, so that was very disappointing for me since that was a big reason why I bought it.  The other thing I can't get it to do is remember the ""sound"" I chose for the Alarm.  It always manages to jump back to the Default sound, which isn't terrible, but isn't my choice, either.  I've yet to figure that simple thing out and the help files aren't much of a help.  Next to these two annoyances, I really like my Echo Dot 3rd Gen and plan on getting some more Smart Plugs to use.",0
4,"Great little ""machine"" to own - useful info provider, in addition to music and book reader
  
",19.Oct.19,Yes,"I bought this 3rd generation Echo because the sound of my previous version echo is sort of low.This 3rd generation has a much better sound but i often times have to speak in a very loud voice so that the thing will stop what is doing because it does not recognize what i am saying.  It is a little ""hard of hearing"" this unit i have.However, I love the echo product.  I like to use the echo in the setting that speaks back to you because i like to teach the kids that a please and a thank you is appropriate, always .. and it works to add a little politeness to them, which is great.I use both echo i own for everything - from phone calls to friends, to locate my phone when i misplace it, to recipe and all the other good stuff.  I love it --- just wish my newer echo was not so ""hard of hearing"" when i try to interrupt when she is not responding correctly to my request.",0
5,"Plug and Play and I LOVE it:  clock is perfect bedside clock
  
",19.Oct.19,Yes,"My 3rd Gen Echo Dot with clock arrived yesterday and I already love it.  I'm in a smallish house and have 1 Echo Spot, numerous smart plugs and the Alexa App already so the Dot was just plug in and all is well.  The only thing I did as far as setup was to schedule ""Do Not Disturb"".  I bought it primarily for a bedside clock and also so that I did not have to ""yell"" to the Spot across my house.  The clock is perfect: enough light to see but not so bright as to be disturbing.  Also nice to ask for temperature  BUT, I am on the hunt for an Alexa compatible weather station so I can get temp at my house for alerts for frost/freeze primarily and town temps do not equal my mountain foothill location temps.  Bottom line, I find the Alexa products and smart ""things"" both useful and fun.",0
4,"Pretty good, but not great
  
",19.Oct.19,Yes,"First, and foremost, understand that Amazon does not believe in this product enough to give it a 1 year warranty like most electronics. You only get 90 days and will need to press the customer service reps to replace this product if it fails you. My speaker blew at around 6 months. I never took it over level 8. My suggestion is to keep it lower than that if you want some longevity out of this item.On the other hand, if you purchase Echo products with a good credit card that extends warranties, like a Costco Citi card, you can run a claim through them.",0
3,"Might be more technology than a rural area can handle
  
",19.Oct.19,Yes,"I have more than a little bit of a chore getting this on-line with a crappy internet connection. The ISP told me I degraded my signal further by adding more devices. GRRRR. Now that I have her on-line my crappy internet is intermittent at best, but early in AM plays great. I have hope if I fire my ISP. I also have to start from scratch if I want to travel with these. Once playing, it has great sound. Alexa has added several items to my shopping list by eavesdropping on conversations -- even something the cat ""said"". Not happy about that either.",0
4,"Needs Bluetooth Connection Software Upgrade
  
",19.Oct.19,Yes,"I think the Echo Dot needs one software upgrade, to enable it to de-select (and not re-connect) to an external Bluetooth audio output.  I put this as one star less under ""Alexa integration,"" since there was not another option.  It is nice to use an Echo Dot to stream music, for a while, but when I am not doing that, I want to use it normally, adn not have it automatically connect to a Bluetooth sound output source.  Yes, the ""blame"" can be placed on an output source automatically re-connecting to the Echo Dot, but a quality product and product team will identify this problem and fix it, not pass the buck.",0
5,"We use these for everything!
  
",19.Oct.19,Yes,"Wonderful device.  The voice recognition is better than anything else I_e used and it works great with our Hue lights and Ring doorbell.  Alexa _uard is a great feature.  There are so many great features and the weekly emails with new features and suggestions is a nice touch.I think everyone should own one of these.The dot is the smallest and cheapest and therefore the sound quality isn_ the best for bigger rooms, but they are perfect for bedrooms and smaller rooms.",0
5,"Great auto brightness
  
",19.Oct.19,Yes,"I needed this Echo Dot (3rd Gen) for the visible clock feature for both daytime and nighttime use.  The auto brightness feature works great for the two lighting extremes.

",20.Oct.19,Yes,"Whats not to love with an Alexa dot?It works exactly as expected, and set up in minutes.I've been using Alexa for a while now, and it senselessly added to my network of devices.We'd been having trouble with a third party speaker, and were really hoping this would resolve that.We were happy to find that it did. It also allows me to announce from my phone, and set up routines that include speaking.Very nice",0
4,"The CLOCK for the winnnnn.
  
",21.Oct.19,Yes,"I_l start by saying that I have owned every version of this Echo dot so far. I also have google home but still prefer the Amazon ecosystem overall. This Echo dot with the clock display was a NO BRAINER for me, I_e been waiting on a clock feature for a couple years now. This newer version is 90% the same as the original Gen 3 echo dot so I won_ rehash that review again. In short. This is the SAME as the original gen 3 but this version adds a clock and a few more tweaks related to the clock and display. Here are some highlights below in a nutshell:-Same as original Gen 3...but with a very useful clock!-Sound is powerful and can be heard across any room. Thanks to the EQ in the Alexa app you can tweak the sound even more.-The LED clock is genius! Shows the weather and has adaptive brightness settings.-In my opinion the clock is worth an extra $10 for the Echo dot-LED time/temperature visible from across the room, even in the daytime.Room For Improvement??-Sorry...I_ still not feeling this power cord. A USB-C connector would have been perfect! I_ even take a micro usb connector compared to the default cord.-Why is the power brick so thick?? My Phone charger has even more power than the Echo power brick at half the size *Head scratch*-The sound is definitely an improvement vs the 2nd Gen echo but it feels just a TAD lower compared to the newest google mini (maybe since the mini has front facing speakers)My Verdict? I give this Echo Dot with LED Clock TWO THUMBS UP! Works great for a bedside clock and I have one in the bathroom now as well for morning news and to tell the time.",9
4,"Improved over the older dot
  
",21.Oct.19,Yes,"I currently have an older generation Alexa dot in each of my children_ room.  My son_ dot had stopped _istening, to the point where I could hold it six inches from my mouth and it wouldn_ hear it.  It would be nice to set the explicit level at each device versus globally.It is bigger than the older dot.  Instead of a usb cable and plug, it is now a regular plug with a barrel connected due to an increase in watts.The time display is nice, especially with how often I find myself asking Alexa what time is it.  I do wish it had a setting to turn completely off at set times (it does an adaptive brightness depending on ambient light).The voice detection is outstanding.  From 10 feet away with music playing it detected _lexa even while playing music louder.The sound has also improved, with much more low end oomph.I did order it to be already attached to my account.  This did not occur.  However, this is the first Alexa out of 6 that I successfully used the iPhone app versus getting out the iPad.I would have preferred a different color.  It is a nice color.",0
5,"Perfect size Alexa
  
",21.Oct.19,Yes,This speaker is perfect for anyone that wants alexa but wont be playing alot of music through the speaker and still wants it to look good.

5,"*Echo Dot - Gen 3* is AWESOME &amp; WORTH EVERY PENNY! MUCH BETTER than 2nd Gen Dot! UPDATED REVIEW!
  
",22.Oct.19,Yes,"I initially gave this only 1 Star due to it's appearance and ""look."" But every other aspect of the ""Echo Dot 3rd Gen Alexa Device"" I'm reviewing and commenting on right now I would give 4/5 or 5/5 Stars normally.  Before I spoke with an Amazon rep during their phone call to me just minutes ago, I did not due to the quality of the ""look"" of said received item (Echo Dot).  Even though it didn't ""look"" right, it worked perfectly.  Now, I have been contacted by Amazon.com via phone # on file (which is even MORE AWESOME because they reached out to me the quickest and in the kindest way possible)!!! So, very quickly after my review, Amazon without hesitation showing their grace and professionalism they offered to make things right.  Therefore, I am now giving this Echo Dot #rd Gen Alexa Device 5/5 Stars all around and an A+ for all those youngsters out there! :p  This Echo Dot works GREAT and responds from far away too!  It hears/responds from great distances (more than I expected) and I LOVE how I just learned about Alexa's ""Routines"" and how to make Custom ""Routines"" as well as adding new, unique and impressive ""Skills"" which are EPIC!Thank you so much ""TAMI"" (aka the Amazon rep who called ME and took HER time to call ME) for all your help. It's because of you, Tami, and your professionalism towards the Amazon Item &amp; Issue(s) -AND- your kindness, acceptance and non-judgmental positive and uplifting attitude towards my very unique physical and mental status that allows ME to make the time to redo a Review like this one and praise the people who SHOULD be praised!  I hope Tami stays with Amazon a long time and hopefully, seeks more responsibility and they move Tami up in the business. Amazon needs strong women like her in higher positions of power to do right by Amazon's customers.  I'm 99% more loyal today to Amazon as a business, as a whole, than I was this very morning, TBH! Also, thanks directly to Amazon as well for ""making it right"" with the problem with my Amazon Original Product!  TY ALL AGAIN!!! :D  Look forward to more business together!!! I just bought a CyberPowerPC Gaming Desktop PC and an Asurion 3 year warranty today or late last night or so and now I'm just waiting on that to get delivered and for payment to go thru! ;-) I LOVE AMAZON AND THEIR PRIME DEALS!!! TY!",1
3,"A great innovation by Amazon but there's a long way to go to....
  
",22.Oct.19,Yes,"Well, I am happy that I kept myself up with the newest product I found very useful and practical and these smart speakers are just one of them. Unlike many others, I am using the echo environment in parallel with the Google assistant. The main reason of doing so comes from the compatibility issues and what these devices are programmed to cover. Yes, there are many similarities that you can get from both but if you are really into the smart assistant devices then you realize that the differences are remarkable and I wanted to have everything covered and connected so I am using both (Amazon echo and Google assistant). For obvious reasons, way bigger than what I can even encounter in here, Google is dominating the market when it comes to the speed and ease of use smart assistants and Alexa which is still quite better than Siri, Cortana and Bixby are still way far from Google on the second place. A great example of the differences here is like,when you are talking to an adult person vs you are talking to a kid! So with an adult you can speak freely and expect to get a response most likely than you are talking to a kid. I personally can't blame Amazon for what Google has been dominating solely for years and years ahead of everyone else so if you learned how to speak with this kid (Alexa in here), she is going to get the job done accurately and there's more, as I mentioned on the very beginning. It comes from the area of what one particular device covers and it's that important to get your attention to have the more compatible smart assistant for the tasks or other services you are planning to use. The bottom line here is the third generation of echo dot devices are the best of it's own kind and having them in parallel with Google assistant will do almost everything for what is doable in 2019 technology relm.",0
5,"Better than Ever
  
",22.Oct.19,Yes,"Have an original echo and about 5 echo dots around the house.  Had some of them for years now.  This one is the best of the echo dot ones for then bedroom.  I cleared my nightstand and removed my clock and the old echo dot along with some cables and stuffs.  It looks clean, neat, and classy.  We got 2, 1 for each nightstand.  The room looks darker since the clock light dims based on how bright it is in the room.  They can be linked as a music group and the sound is much better than the 2nd generation echo dots.  It sounds quite nice while both are playing.  The display show not only the time, but if the alarm is on, and the temperature if you ask Alexa for it.  You can select the alarm sound, but that is for all of them.  I traded one of the old echo dots for $5, but got also a 25% on another echo dot with clock for my daughter's room to minimize the clutter there.  You can enable Freetime and block explicit filters so it works out nicely.  Would totally recommend.",0
5,"Wow, significantly better speaker than 2nd gen
  
",22.Oct.19,Yes,"I replaced the 2nd gen echo dot in my daughter's room with this 3rd gen, then took her 2nd gen for my office.  I like the new design, the fabric looks very classy. I was blown away how much nicer, richer, and louder the sound is from the new one. When she puts on an audiobook at night, we ask her to turn the volume down to 2 so we can't hear it all the way down the hall!",1
5,"Dot with Clock Is Worth The Extra $
  
",22.Oct.19,Yes,"We wanted to add a Dot to the bedroom (voice-controlled heat/AC is the best!) and I bought this to replace my alarm clock. Integrated into my Alexa app quickly and easily, and looks nice in the new ""sandstone"" color. As a bonus, the clock auto-dims according to room light and my wife really like our new, darker room. Alarms and sleep timers can be set by voice which is way easier than scrolling through the time on a clock. Sound is not as good as my Echo but I wouldn't expect that given how small it is. It recognizes voices from across the room and is very responsive. I also added the Alexa smart plug for five dollars extra which made it a great deal.",0
3,"We just don't use these are we thought we would
  
",22.Oct.19,Yes,"Basically we have bought a few egg-times. We just don't use these are they are intended. It's a particularly poor music speaker, the room to room intercom is not good enough and the rest is hype. At least someone in Amazon can listen in to our arguments. Please let me know who you are so that you can confirm that I am right and she is wrong.",1
5,"Best echo device so far. Clock is a great feature
  
",22.Oct.19,Yes,Excellent new echo device. It_ perfect for a night table and the clock has an automatic dimmer when the light is turned out. Set up was a breeze as I already have the app and several devices in two houses. You just get a notice of a new device and accept and it almost sets up itself. Sound is much improved over the earlier version as well. Even my wife who hates gadgets likes the way it looks and the ability to get the weather for the day before even getting out of bed. Highly recommended.,0

",22.Oct.19,Yes,"I finally jumped on this Echo Dot bandwagon thanks to Amazon Prime Day. Well, this purchase disappointed. If Alexa even understands your instructions, you might get something going. But the connection is horrible and it's definitely not our network. And like I said, most of the time Alexa can't even decipher what someone is saying. I tried returning this but guess what?...Missed the cutoff. It's been sitting in the junk drawer since.",0
5,"Echo is working and integrating with our home.
  
",22.Oct.19,Yes,"We bought two of these and started with a home security system that also gave us one. Most of the time it works well with integration to our systems. It has difficulty with one smart plug, but none of the other items we own. Works great with our security system. Part of our difficulty is with smart devices that only work with the lower Wi-Fi frequency. The Echo dot does great with 2 or 5 frequency channels of our Wi-Fi.",0

",22.Oct.19,Yes,Much better than the first version but there is a bug in the software which I have reported but has not been fixed yet.

It_ been 4 weeks since I reported this and nothing has been fixed. And if anyone is listening at Amazon I have a case Id.,1
5,"Loving my Dot 3rd Gen!
  
",23.Oct.19,Yes,"I love my little dot! We're still ""learning"" each other but so far, the AskMyBuddy App made this purchase worth it all!  The monthly payment plan made it possibly - I could not have paid full price up front, so for that, I thank Amazon immensely. I did purchase a wall mount that I am very pleased with - it's truly portable to be used in any room.  Planning on purchasing a second one after this one is paid off.  One for the kitchen, one for the bedroom.  I live in a 915sq ft apt, so having one at both ends makes more sense.PROS:  Great features.  I use the time, temperature/weather/ daily flash news, Amazon music and reminders more than anything else so far.  I bought a smart plug for the bedroom light and that works brilliantly. I've played with skills, but she is way smarter than I am.  That's a hit to the ego frankly, so I've left it alone after being owned so many times.  LOLI love being able to create my own skills.  I've had fun with that! (I had an 8-second  .mp4 video of a new skill, but when I tried to upload the vid to this review,  it said it could not process the  .mp4 file)Having compatible security products adds another layer of awesome for this little dot. So many different uses for so many different items makes this Dot a great addition to the home.CONS:1.  Smart Plugs are overpriced.  I did buy one on a flash sale for $6 - but otherwise, they are $25.  WAY too much.2.  I have a Galaxy S4 phone and the app is not compatible.  Having to use my Galaxy Tab A tablet for the App - but since that is reliant only on Wi-fi, I am limited to those parameters to update the app or create a new skill.3.  Set up was a bear!  I use my desktop PC for EVERYTHING. The PC doesn't have wi-fi.  Having an old phone didn't help either, and setup was impossible over the tablet because it has no carrier.  Had I not had a laptop that I could hard-wire to the router AND that had wi-fi, I could not have set this up.  So beware of that.  If you have out of date tech stuff - and can't afford to update it, it may prove to be difficult.  Borrow a friends laptop that can be hard-wired to the router AND use wifi - you have to go in hardwired then during setup, turn on wifi at the same time.  Once it is set up though - it's a well-greased machine!4.  With it being mounted in the wall mount, the sound range is increased, IMO, but it's bass-y.  I've told it to turn the bass down; it's all the way down now and still sounds too deep.  Perhaps for Alexa, it's all about that bass!  LOL - not a deal breaker, just an observation. To be fair, for a little thing, it packs great sound otherwise.------Overall, this is a fun tool that is also a life saver when you get the AskMyBuddy app.  I paid the extra $3.99 a month to add more contacts, but I'm a senior who lives alone and this app alone, makes it worthwhile for anyone wanting to get their parents that have wi-fi, something fun and useful for any occasion. I highly recommend a wall mount.  I bought the one from ""ProudBird"" on amazon for $9.99 and it keeps the wires neat and out of the way.  Just remember though, when you unplug it from the wall, the plug stays and the mount goes - be careful when pulling out of the wall to be mindful of that. Nice pairing of two great products though.",0
5,"Like the latest edition
  
",23.Oct.19,Yes,"I picked up my 5th echo device for my dog, I mean spare bedroom.  It also happens to be where my parents dog sleeps when he_ staying with us for a few days. He stinks to high heaven so we keep the window open to air the room out, problem is, he_ a dog, they have excellent hearing. He_l hear a dog bark from miles away it seems and then he_l start barking, at the wee hours of the morning!  My son uses his echo dot nightly to play ocean sounds so I figured I_ give it a try with the dog, put a little white noise on to drown out the outside sounds. I couldn_ be happier to say it worked like a charm, he no longer is bothered by nighttime noises so he doesn_ wake up the neighborhood with his barking. Big dogs come with big barks, lol.",0
5,"Better than 2nd generation
  
",23.Oct.19,Yes,"I've been a happy owner of a 2nd generation Echo and three 2nd generation Echo Dots for a few years now. and I was glad to add the 3rd generation echo dot with clock to my home.  The biggest difference is the new look: it's so much nicer than the  2nd generation Dot and comes in a variety of colors, the speaker quality is so much  better speaker quality than Echo Dot Gen 2. Aside from its larger size and slight convex bulge, the top of the device is nearly identical to that of the 2nd generation Dot: it has four buttons (volume up, volume down, microphone off, and an ""action"" button) and a multi-colored light ring around the top edge that tells you about the Echo's status. The side of the device has an input for the power cable and a 3.5-mm output jack.The biggest noticeable  improvement is the shape of the power cable, which sits flatter against the wall than the 2nd generation Dot's cable . The set up is easy connect the Dot to your WiFi network and the app leads you through everything.",0
5,"Loving our virtual assistant
  
",23.Oct.19,Yes,"We really enjoy our Echo and the Smart Plug that came along with this bundle. I love being able to play Jeopardy with the device, and it's great for when you're getting ready in the morning and you need to know the weather forecast but don't have time to stop and check your phone. The Smart Plug and Alexa allow us to set an alarm and automatically turn on the bedroom light at a certain time so that we make sure we get up when we need to. It can do so much more, we just haven't had time to fully explore the device's capabilities.My boyfriend is still a bit suspicious of the device, but I'm overall very satisfied with it.",0
5,"If your house isn't 'smart' what are you doing
  
",23.Oct.19,Yes,"I have multiple dots in my house and absolutely love them. Leaving the dogs alone for a while? ""Alexa, play Lord of the Rings in the living room"". Having a guests over? ""Alexa, turn on my party lights"". Want a relaxing morning? ""Alexa, play sirius xm coffee house radio"". Getting organized? ""Alexa, make me a to-do list"". These things are just great. I have almost all my electronics hooked up to Alexa and it has changed my life. My lamps, tvs, sound systems, security cameras, and even my switches are connected and voice activated or are on timers. You seriously don't know how much you needed these things in your life until you get them.",0
4,"Good but not great
  
",23.Oct.19,Yes,"Id still like to see some improvements on the microphone on this device. I have a full sized echo in another room about 20-25ft away and one in the same room im in less than 8 ft away and when i say the wake word the one in the room away will pickup and the one in the same room will not, even with no obstructions and keeping it away from the wall as recommended by support.The audio quality is much improved from the second generation dot though which is very nice.",0
5,"My Little Helper
  
",23.Oct.19,Yes,"I got the Dot while preparing for my surgery/recovery. I am so glad I did! Alexa is amazing, she was my helper my entertainment and she kept me on track. Her skills are exceptional and very helpful for someone who couldn't get up and walk after surgery. I also got the plug-in wall casing for the Dot - the sound is great and the unit looks good and clean on my wall. I would definitely recommend Alexa Dot and I am going to purchase again to place in other rooms. Very pleased with my purchase.",0
4,"Fuller Sound!
  
",24.Oct.19,Yes,"I_e had 2nd gen Dots for a few years. I love the new cloth design. The old covers were a bit ridiculous. Also a dust magnet.I_ not going to be rough on a product I got for .99¢. A promotion for signing up with Amazon Music Ul. I was ditching another service anyways.The speaker has a fuller and more immersive sound. Keep your expectations realistic. Music is more enjoyable and less tinny.Alexa falls flat. Not the service, but when she interacts. The voice sounds like she_ underwater. Even worse if you have a slight echo. Picture the bathroom. Not a deal-breaker, but still annoying. I_ more sensitive to tones with my blindness. Hopefully a correction for the next generation. Also, Google Mini doesn_ suffer from this. Relatively similar in size.My REAL issue is the AC adapter. Who_ brilliant idea was it to ditch the micro USB? Less intrusive over this monstrosity that plugs in. Not practical for areas like a bathroom. Certainly not dealing with a Johnny I_e design aesthetic. Yeah, I know it_ a $50 product. Aesthetics bring a sense of zen into their respective placement.All said, an overall decent product. Which has a definite fuller sound.",1
5,"Makes Life Easier
  
",24.Oct.19,Yes,"Before purchasing this dot, I had an echo plus. I find that the echo dot is a great addition to my bedroom and allows my day to run more smoothly. I currently use the dot to set multiple alarms for the morning, set a timer for when to give my child her medicine, and answer simple questions while I am getting dressed in the morning (""What is the weather today in _______? What does it feel like outside? etc). While this device isn't revolutionary in what it does (because we have had smartphones for a while), it makes life easier and allows me to do these things handsfree. I run a daycare, so sometimes while I am changing a diaper, I will ask Alexa questions that I would normally need my hands for (Alexa, what time is it?). Overall, a nice addition to the Echo/Alexa lineup.",1
3,"Bit difficult to connect things but good quality for the price
  
",24.Oct.19,Yes,"For the price is great especially I got the Great deal on it. however setting it up is bit pain especially if you don't want to take time reading the instruction.. also I think this was made for native English speaker so if you have an accent or something you might have to repeat yourself couple times. I'm getting used to it though so I might try in different language setting if there is one, but for basic purposes like listening to radio or music was okay. quality of listening is pretty good just setting it up was bit of a pain that's all.",0
5,"The GREAT HELPER
  
",24.Oct.19,Yes,"This is a great product.. No questions about.. It is one of the hallmarks of Amazon.  I enjoy using it and love how my commands are carry out... ""No complaining from Alexa ever"" LOL.... Doesn't matter what i ask her to do.....For somebody that has live as long as I have, it borders science fiction when I utilize Alexa.  I have not scratch the surface of the things she can do....  It is a paramount buy for the money.PS.  I have 3 great grand lovely girls.  They spend weekends with my wife and me. Like all kids at 8 and lower, bed time is a struggle.  I just discover Alexa bed time stories, and the trip to dreamland has easy up when they listen to them.",1
1,"Terrible sound quality. It's called a speaker, but it's more like a muffled mess.
  
",24.Oct.19,Yes,"I have something like 5 different Alexa devices and this is my least favorite. Why? The sound quality is terrible. It's supposed to be a speaker so I assumed that the sound would be at least as good as a regular Dot. Nope. It sounds muffled and there is no volume level that sounds good. It sounds like it's speaking through a blanket or heavy winter scarf. I do like the look of this one, but the sound ""quality"" makes it my very least favorite Echo -- by far.",0
4,"Makes my house so smart
  
",24.Oct.19,Yes,"I use alexa for just about everything electric in my house. its easy to install. i had the 2nd gen and the 3rd gen has some upgrades. its a little bigger but the sound quality is very good, especially for music and morning alarms. Alexa has so many features. The only thing i dislike is the power plug. it used to be USB but not anymore. you have to use the given wire. Besides that i love my alexa.",0
5,"Surprisingly Capable Voice Assistant
  
",25.Oct.19,Yes,"This is my families first Alexa hardware product and boy does it produce. She_ quick and surprisingly knowledgeable. She has answers for everything and a great trivia knowledge which is fun. I like that you can change the wake word to four predetermined ones (computer is an option for Star Trek fans). If someone in your family is named Alexa you can still use it without it driving you nuts.It gets loud enough to hear in other rooms and the amount of automation, which Amazon calls _outines, is extensive. I have it a set up to lower the volume to 3 (out of 10) at 9pm and raise it back up to 5 at 9am. This keeps our kids from waking us up and we don_ have to constantly change the volume. There are plenty more options if you have other smart lighting even not in the Ring universe. Ex. It can control my IKEA TR_DFRI smart plugs I use for lighting. All of this without setting it up.It is a little creepy to have it always listening to us and it knows a surprising amount about my other accounts (Pandora worked with my account without setup). My wife and I don_ talk about anything work confidential at home but it may bother others if they work from home. There is a physical mute button on the top of the echo dot but it_ only a software switch and not a hardware one. If that makes a difference to you be ware.Overall, we got ours free with the Ring Alarm system as a promo and the echo dot is a surprisingly good voice assistant and we all use it more often than I figured. Definitely a good buy.",0
5,"Perhaps one of the devices that we use the most
  
",25.Oct.19,Yes,"It integrates beautifully in our home. It is located at my boy's room and from there it controls several devices, it can hear me even from the living room, at 25 feet away and from there it turns on and off the lights at the hallway, for example.We took it to our lounge room for small meetings with friends and it fun to control and fight over which song we will listen next.It learns everyday and skills are getting smarter every week. I'm very please with the product, so please that I bought one for my parent house, with my intention to keep it for me, since I thought they will not use it and get bored about Alexa, quite the opposite they love it and now they are asking me for another one to place it in their second floor.",1
5,"Superb Sound
  
",25.Oct.19,Yes,"This is second one i Baught. At first, I was reluctant to talk to a hockey puck.  Okay so I am old fashioned.  I use smart sockets in some areas in my home.  I have them connected to my phone.  But I found out you could program the Echo Dot to them.  I have gotten used to talking to it.  I now command it to turn on and turn off certain things around my home.  You can command it to guard your home.  You can ask where your orders are.  If you say good morning it will give you information as to what happened on that date years ago.  You can joke with it too.  The things you can do with it are endless.",0
3,"Some great improvements but not with the microphones.
  
",25.Oct.19,Yes,"This is definitely a great improvement over the Echo Dot 2nd Gen in all aspects except the microphones. I use to work for Amazon doing phone tech support for Echos and Kindles so I am disappointed with this. The older Echo Dot had 7 microphones and the new Echo Dot only has 4. They said it should be better but most of the time, my Echo Dot has issues hearing me. I had to by a 3rd party stand just to adjust the angle and have the device work face out toward the room. I never had an issue with my Echo 1st Gen or the Echo Dot 2nd Gen when they were in the same location.",0
1,"Buyer Beware - $1 Echo Dot sale is too good to be true.
  
",25.Oct.19,Yes,"So, get this!  I ordered this Echo Dot on sale for $1 with a subscription to Amazon Music Unlimited.  Good deal, right?  Wrong!  Amazon delivered the wrong item to my house.  This isn't normally a problem because they typically make it right with no problems.  Not this time!  Because it was bought with a subscription, my only option was to purchase a new Echo Dot for full price ($49.99).  They did give me my $1.00 back though.  The pic of what I received is NOT an Echo Dot! LOL!",1
3,"iffy mic results. Also direct plug in version of EchoDot3 would be more practical.
  
",25.Oct.19,Yes,"I find that if I set the volume low, Alexa doesn't respond to commands as well. Amazon always claims that audio volume and mic listening ability are not related - BUT, I agree with some other folk who have reported the same results. I so wish they would offer a direct plug in Echo dot. (Not the tiny new echo plug in they just started to sell) It would be nice to get rid of the messy wires and make echo less conspicuous.",0
5,"Does what you expect
  
",25.Oct.19,Yes,"After the super easy set up, the Echo Dot performs exactly as you expect. The voice recognition is fast, and the sound quality is acceptable. It's much better than a phone speaker so its bluetooth connection is very helpful. The fabric on the outside is fantastic and the overall weight of the Dot is very nice.I would like more customization like a custom wake up word, nickname when talking to me, more alarm sound options, and ability to play youtube audio.Overall this is a great little home device.",0
4,"Great sound quality, excellent voice-recognition sensitivity
  
",25.Oct.19,Yes,"Love the rich, deeper sound. No ""tinny"" speaker! Excellent range on voice-recognition tasks. Recognizes commands even while streaming music and talk radio. Good weight, stays put on surfaces. Excellent purchase!",1
5,"LOVE IT!!!!
  
",26.Oct.19,Yes,"I_ now hooked on this thing. I use it all the time. She_ my cooking timer, music, lighting controller, back up to my burglar alarm, random information and alarm clock. Also regarding the alarm clock.... yelling Alexa shut the f-up!!! Actually works at 5am to turn off the alarm clock LOL.... you can also say Alexa call (name) and she will make a phone call for you. Handy when your in the middle of cooking or doing dishes. I got another one for my 76 year old mother. Got her life alert and she refused it. Got her Alexa and she_ using it. If my mom falls or gets stuck she can now just yell Alexa call 911 and help will arrive.... got my mom three more echos so she_ covered in the entire house.",0
5,"Echo, indispensible!
  
",26.Oct.19,Yes,"I love everything about this Echo.  We are having fun with the ""Announce"" feature at bedtime. If you announce ""good night"" it plays a cute little tune. You can ask things to specific devices like ""Ask Bea's Echo to bring me tea"" or ask Livingroom Alexa to turn off the flood lights. Mostly I ask for music or details on an actor/actress that I'm currently watching on TV. The Echo is separate and I don't want to bother Alexa (but, sometimes I do.) I set Echo alarms, and tell all of the kids ""announce"" dinner is ready. This is an underpriced gizmo -- making life a little easier and fun!",0
2,"I keep having to reset my echo everyday
  
",26.Oct.19,Yes,"When it's  working I have I no problem asking it anything and it will answer me, but by the end of the day or the next day, I'll say Alexa and the echo will turn blue on top and I will ask it something like what time is it or what's the weather like today and it won't answer, It just stays quiet. I'll keep asking it about two or three more time and it does the same thing.I end up having to reset it and then it works ok for that day only.It will work if you push the _ction button and ask it what you want but as for as answering you when you ask it something with  your voice it wont answer you..I like it but I don't like having to reset it everyday...Am I the only one having this problem or Maybe you can tell me what I'm doing wrong .",1
5,"Beyond expectations
  
",26.Oct.19,Yes,"I purchased the new Echo Dot with clock to replace my much older and failing bedroom alarm clock. After a week_ worth of use, I can already say with confidence it was worth every penny. The ability to adjust the brightness, set multiple alarms in the matter of seconds (and visually see them appear for confirmation), and Alexa_ whisper function are my favorite features so far beyond a typical Echo Dot. Any reservation I had of switching from an old school alarm clock to the newest technology is gone. It has exceeded my expectations. - 43 year old mom",0
4,"use in kitchen for timers and music!!
  
",26.Oct.19,Yes,"I love echo products... I already have some on my porch and my bedroom. I put this on one in my kitchen and I like it. Granddaughter set it up so I can get it to set alarms like ""echo set timer for 20 minutes"" or whatever for cooking! It's easier than trying to do it on stovetop with buttons. Also I like to listen to my music while I'm cooking so this is perfect -- I have a radio station that I can ask it to play. It's very easy to use and I love it! I would buy more Echo Alexas if I could.",0
5,"Just the right size
  
",26.Oct.19,Yes,"If you worried about devices listening in on your conversations I would suggest you get over it. Phones, computers, TVs, tablets they all do this. We love this device. We can tell her to play music and turn it up or down or skip a song. She can play specific songs or a shuffle, which we use for the kids like super simple songs. It_ the perfect size, not too expensive. My only complaint is that when you have the music on depending on the volume she may not hear your voice if you try to call her name.",0
5,"Sound quality much improved.  But still a little too mush bass for speech
  
",26.Oct.19,Yes,"I listen to the news on this device.  This replaced my 1st generation Echo in which the speaker ""died"".  Sound quality improved BUT, in my opinion too much bass.  Also on daily briefing, too much difference in volume between BBS News (volume drops considerably) and Associated Press...Wayyyyy to loud.  This volume difference issue is not device dependent, I've notice for a few years on all of my devices ( have 3 Echo devices).",0
1,"Horrible
  
",26.Oct.19,Yes,"Won't open any app on fire stick. Sometimes it'll search. But if you tell it to open Netflix, it only searches, and didn't even give Netflix in the search results. The boss baby is the first search result for Netflix. I literally got this JUST for the fire stick, and it's extremely pointless for that. If it does manage to give the correct result, it won't actually open it.",0
5,"Almost perfect
  
",27.Oct.19,Yes,"I love the product dont get me wrong, but one feature keeps failing on me once in a while. If you bought the product to be used as a bluetooth speaker for the PC, it does work just not all the time. After a few days the connection on the PC would say connected to Bluetooth. Connection on the Alexa setting would also say connected but there is no sound. Just plug out the power at the echo, wait a few moment and plug it back in. This will reset the device and upon reconnecting the bluetooth after reset it would work. I had to do this twice after a week of using it. Not perfect but yeah does its job.. that is the only complain i have.. Would recommend.",0
4,"A nice little music streamer
  
",27.Oct.19,Yes,I use the Dot3 connected to a class D amplifier via it's 3.5mm outputs playing through a pair of Overnight Sensation DIY speakers. The Dot3's DAC is surprisingly good and comparable to the Chrome Cast Audio streaming into a $99 Topping DAC. I wish it had a digital output so I could take advantage of an external DAC like I do with the CCA and no doubt the sound would be even better. The Echo Link allows this but it's priced too high for what it does which is probably why it's ratings and popularity are not so great. Based on the $24 I paid for the Dot3 it deserves 5 stars but my first one's output died after a few weeks but Amazon replaced it.,0
3,"Better than 2nd gen, but has it's flaws
  
",27.Oct.19,Yes,"So I've been using echos since the first gen.  This is my first third gen, and I'm not really enjoying some of the changes.  Mainly it doesn't power by USB anymore, but rather uses a pigtail connector and ac adapter that comes with it.  I'm not a fan of being tied to a special power adapter like this.  I like having options for power delivery that the previous generations had.  It's bigger and heavier, the sound quality is improved over the 2nd gen.  I still miss the ring from the first gen.  But bring back USB power.  Use USB c if you have higher power needs now.",0
5,"So far loving it.
  
",27.Oct.19,Yes,So far loving it. The kiddos are in love with Alexa always asking questions love the home guarding setting so awesome and also the math quiz for kids it_ awesome everything it_ good about Alexa even the price on this echo dot looking forward to get the bigger version of this one. Did I mention that we sleep with the thunderstorm sounds on then she goes to sleep by herself also the do not disturb lights off it_ great thank you amazon. Now the new home activity detection it_ great love it.,0
4,"Needs to have its own way to connect to the internet.
  
",27.Oct.19,Yes,"I bought this for my 90 year old mother. I haven_ got it set up for her yet, as she does not have Wifi. There is an Xfinity guest hotspot, but for some reason, I cannot connect to it.  I_ working on getting her her own internet.  It seems Amazon dropped the ball on this.  There should be a Echo Dot version that can connect on its own, like a cell phone built into it.  This would be a great safety feature, and millions more people would buy it to know their elderly loved ones could call them with their voice only.",0
5,"Best thing I've bought so far
  
",27.Oct.19,Yes,"I've never been into the smart home stuff Cuz I just thought I didn't need it. Well I decided I'd finally try something like this and I gotta say I'm glad I did. I don't have a stereo so I listen to music on this and the sound is actually really nice for a small speaker. The bass isn't the best but thats Cuz I like alot of bass. Through the alexa app u can have alexa do certain things and customize her. She has drop in features where u can talk to whoever is in another room. She can record like if u say hey alexa tell ""..."" to stop shell record ur voice and tell that person to stop and so on. This is alot better than I thought it'd be. I'm really happy I bought this. Alexa has became part of my everyday life now. I definitely recommend getting one of these if u haven't yet. She does soooooo much that I can't list every thing.",0
3,"Alexa Worked Fine
  
",28.Oct.19,Yes,"I was excited, at my age, and looking forward to having a partial smart home.  I ordered the Echo Dot 3 gen (which I love even now) and two smart plugs to control two lamps...one in the bedroom and one by the front door.  The dot worked perfectly, plug it in and Alexa is ""in the house.""  The smart plugs would connect to the home network but no matter what we (Amazon Tech and myself) tried, the plugs would not react to the ""off/on"" commands.  The software would find the smart plug, install the drivers or whatever, but no reaction.  I was disappointed with the smart plugs only.  Please do not let my experience interfere with moving up a notch in the ""Smart Universe.""  This is probably an isolated incident and a possible something I overlooked in my network.  On top of it all, I lost my patience!  I wanted it to work out of the box.  I returned the entire package with reluctance.  Amazon is a great company for me.  I have never ever had to return anything before.  I personally realize there is no way back from the ""Smart Universe.""  By the way, the return was flawless.",0
5,"Echo Upgrade - Better than ever
  
",28.Oct.19,Yes,"I have a V1 Echo and even though that one is larger with bigger speakers - this one is almost on par with in it terms of loudness and sound quality.  Its quite a testament in how far they have come with the technology packed into the these small dots.  What is even better about these is that you can pair a couple of these together for big sound that envelops your house.Everything that is good about the V1 Echo is as good with dot instead its small, sleeker, and blends in better with the house decor.  If you are looking to jump into the Alexa landscape this is a great product to start with and eventually grow.",0
2,"Inaccessible for anyone below a recent (problematic!) iOS update
  
",28.Oct.19,Yes,"This is literally a paperweight because I'm not given access to the app and they don't offer the ability to operate via a pc. I have an iPhone 6s which has been GREAT, no issues whatsoever and great battery life.  I am aware that updating to the newer iOS' can cause serious issues or shut down your phone, so I avoid them and my phones been great.  But because the Alexa app only works starting at a certain newer iOS update, I can't even download it to set it up. Thus, I can't even use my dot. _ They should really allow access to everyone...",0
5,"Echo Dot 3rd generation is the way to go!
  
",28.Oct.19,Yes,"We like everything about the Echo Dot 3rd generation actually! Alexa is not hard of hearing she picks up every time we talk to her! It's so nice to be sitting around the house or whatever we may be doing and we say ""hey Alexa play Halloween music"" as we're carving pumpkins and it works! Or another example I love to use it when I'm cleaning house or game night!! We love it and will be purchasing another I'm sure! Thanks!",0

",28.Oct.19,Yes,"Holy moly was this difficult to set up! I'm not sure if my husband's Bluetooth being turn on his phone while I was setting up that caused issues but it took me far too long to get it figured out. In the end, we got it right. She didn't give me my morning brief when I greeted her this morning but we're still getting to know each other.True story, first thing Alexa did for us was meow like a cat. We'll get along just fine.",0
4,"Inability to physically shut off alarm...only snooze.
  
",28.Oct.19,Yes,"I got this particular echo dot because of the display. I figured that it would completely replace my nightstand alarm clock. While you can tap the top of the unit to snooze the alarm, you can't tap or touch anything on the dot to ""shut off"" the alarm. I realize I can say ""Alexa, shut off the alarm"", but I would rather NOT have to do that at 5:30AM while my wife is peacefully sleeping.So, every stinking morning I have to go into the app on my phone to switch the slider to the off position. Now the other problem that this causes is that I have to restart my alarm every night. Not happy about this.",0

",28.Oct.19,Yes,"Alexa is amazing and the integration is so much deeper than any of the other smart assistants I have tried.

Notable difference: Alexa, I want to play Jeopardy leads to a trivia game with the speaker. Another smart speaker will instead play a random song titled Jeopardy...",0
5,"Perfect inexpensive entry into a 'smart house' monitor!
  
",29.Oct.19,Yes,"My first Alexa product... wow. I am soooo impressed!Along with most other people, I am also concerned about eavesdropping. So I have installed it into a spare bedroom that we rarely have conversation in. I'm not sure we ever say anything that would bother me terribly to have someone overhear, but that thought still bothers me enough to keep it out of common areas til I'm more comfortable with it.What I marveled at was how you can ask Alexa to make calls from my contact list. I know some people are worried about sharing that info with Alexa, but take a look at how many apps already have access to your contact list, none of which (other than phone and text) enhance your experience. Alexa makes calls for you while lying in bed!!! This feature made me so happy, I bought one for my mom immediately. She has a rescue alert downstairs, but insists on sleeping upstairs, where rescue alert may not hear her. Now, she can tell Alexa to call me from bed if she needs me!! The peace of mind is priceless.I haven't explored all of Alexa's features, but the ones I like best are the ability to control lights (Alexa lights on, lights off), and the thermostat, while laying in bed. From the guest room, I can turn the ac up simply by telling Alexa to do it, and my husband is none the wiser. HAAAA!!!  The ability to make calls or emergency calls while in bed is wonderful! I can have my cell charging on the table, and make calls from Alexa! The sleep assistance skills which include meditation, sounds (forest, waterfall, rain, thunderstorm - all free). Music on demand... Amazon already has my extensive playlist, so I can have it play a pretty large variety already, plus the Prime Music (and if you have Amazon Music, there's literally no limit to what it can play on demand). Let me expand on the meditation.... this actually does a guided meditation that changes daily to help you calm and relax. It's remarkable, and the perfect ending to a hectic day! I LOVE this!Because it's in a spare bedroom, I haven't spent a lot of time talking to it for it to get fully used to my voice. I have noticed that when I'm slurring my speech from sleepiness, it doesn't always recognize me, and sometimes when it does, I'm surprised because I know I'm groggy and slurring. I imagine that if I had a cold or flu, the problem would get worse, but perhaps that will improve over time as the recognition grows.I am definitely glad I got this, and looking forward to exploring all the new features! At this price, I would recommend it to anyone to try (along with a light switch or plug, so you can get instant light turn on off gratification). What a great intro to a smart house!!",0
5,"My Favorite Clock in the House
  
",29.Oct.19,Yes,"I recently became a cord-cutter.  And while I don't miss cable TV too much, I quickly missed the digital clock in the living room that was on the old cable box.  This Echo Dot with clock is a great replacement for that.My children enjoy asking questions to Alexa and I like listening to SiriusXM channels linked through my online account.I thought I would like the clock's adaptive brightness, but the digits were a bit too dim to read during the day, so now I just use a permanent brightness of 40% and that works great.This is the fifth Alexa device that I've purchased, and I'm just as happy with this one as I am with the others.  Five stars!!!!!",0
5,"Tiny steps to home integration
  
",29.Oct.19,Yes,"Been deciding which company to go with for future smart home integration.  After looking at Google, Apple, and Amazon, decided to go with Amazon Alexa based system.  We already have Ring doorbell and also Ecobee smart thermometer so this seems to be a natural move to go with Echo.  Setup is very straight forward and quick, and everything is very intuitive to use so far.Of course, the deal to get a unit for 1 dollar with 1 month subscription to Amazon Music makes this deal that much sweeter.Loving it!!",0
3,"Echo Dot Third Generation with Time Display
  
",29.Oct.19,Yes,"The light sensor for the time display does not adjust properly to light settings. In the dark it is too subtle, difficult to read. There is no ability to adjust light sensor settings. Other features same as with earlier versions of DOT, except generation 3 is not compatible with all 2nd generation external speakers for which the device needs to be cradled.",1
5,"Mi familia la llamamos Tia Alexa!
  
",29.Oct.19,Yes,"Hemos probado otros dispositivos pero realmente el Echo Dot superó por mucho a los demás. Mi primer ventaja es la calidez de la voz, no tan robotizada sino amable, además entiende muchos mejor y resuelve prontamente. En casa tenemos 2 Echo dot y todos los focos wifi están controlados por voz. Es la mejor recomendación.",1
5,"Changed our life!!
  
",30.Oct.19,Yes,I want to say my Dad had an accident last November and Alexa made our lives so much better. He was paralyzed and now he has more movement but not much. Alexa and the Alexa plugs made it where he could turn on the TV and lamp. You don_ think about those simple things much but when you can_ even turn on a light when you wake up until someone else does it you could be laying in the dark for 30 minutes if your caregivers are busy. If you want to go to bed but can_ turn off the tv or light you_e at someone else_ mercy. My dad couldn_ use his phone but Alexa made it where he could call people. My kids even got to drop in on their Grandpa when they wanted. He was able to hear the news if he wanted and his favorite was listening to music. When all you can do it lay in bed it_ amazing to be able to have those simple freedoms and abilities. I am beyond thankful for Alexa. My dad is at a facility now doing acute physical therapy and they don_ have good WIFI and Alexa. Any connect and it_ so sad to us but for the last year it was his lifeline and once he is well enough to come home (if he ever is) then I_ sure she will be very valuable again. Thanks Amazon for such a user friendly product.,5
5,"Worth what I paid, which was ninety nine cents with a music subscription.
  
",30.Oct.19,Yes,"Didn't know what to expect, but I have it playing music, telling me how cold it is outside, etc. Also controls two plug devices, after a hassle setting them up.  Sometimes, I am surprised what it doesn't ""know"".  Like how many miles in a degree of latitude. (69}.  I actually got it to answer by asking how many meters from the equator to the North Pole (ten million - defined by the French expeditions along the Prime Meridian}, then asking how many miles in ten million meters, then dividing THAT by 90, the number of degrees of latitude from the equator to the North Pole.  Echo couldn't put all those things together by itself, or didn't know the basic fact.  On the other side, it told me that Barbara Walters is 90, and it doesn't know if she has Alzheimer's. So, it's sort of OK. Good to find out if some public figure is still alive, I guess.",0
1,"Stopped working after 5 months.
  
",30.Oct.19,Yes,"Everything was fine in the beginning, however after 5 months of light use (playing music) it decided not to work.  I ask Alexa to play music.  All is well at first, but then about 4 minutes into the music she stops.  Sometimes I get 45 minutes before it stops working.  It is annoying because it has to start over at new places in the que.  I wouldn't have written the review, however, I couldn't find a way to contact Amazon directly.  Into the trash it goes.",1
1,"Not smart what so ever
  
",30.Oct.19,Yes,"I gave this product 4 stars after purchased I was giddy and excited but soon realized I was mistaken this thing is not smart.. black Friday comes and I ask ""Alexa how much is a Google home mini? It says "" the echo Dot 3 .... "" This happens all the time I can't ask anything about Google products ? I was just trying to buy my mother a Google home mini for Christmas.. so instead I asked Google on my phone how much a echo whatever is and without hesitation it told me an unbias answer.. if I didnt have a fire stick 4k which I love I would throw echo in the trash.. don't believe me ? Go ahead ask your echo ""Alexa why does Amazon factories have such high injury rates ?

",30.Oct.19,Yes,"I wanted another Echo I could put in a guest bathroom. If someone fell in a tub or needed help, they could just have Alexa call me. Of course that is also possible to do that in other parts of the house (we have 5 Echo Alexa products so far and 2 more will complete the process).I also purchased the gizmo that fits this 3rd generation Echo Dot that plugs into the wall socket in the bathroom and it works great. This newer Echo has a more superior quality sound.",0

",30.Oct.19,Yes,"Alexa_ nickname is _orthless in our house. Doesn_ enable you to voice select for individual programs. Sometimes just doesn_ work at all when you give it a voice command. It will stop and resume your program fairly reliably. Other than that, can_ say it_ done much to make our viewing easier. The remote that came with our fire stick is the only reliable way to control our set. We don_ care about having some dumb joke told to us or what a sports score is.",0
1,"Can Amazon just, please, fix it!
  
",31.Oct.19,Yes,"Update: I have reduced this to 1 star. I got a phone call that sounded like something was going to happen, but nothing did. I've waited a week. Time to get my money back.I want to give this a good review. I have purchased so many Echo devices for myself and friends and family, I am obviously a fan. I have 7 active and 3 inactive devices in my house right now, plus Kindles everywhere! However, this one has a problem I cannot get resolved. When I drop in to chat with someone the speaker on the Dot fails after 5 minutes. I can no longer hear the other person, but they can hear me. I've explained this to customer service, but they just don't seem to understand what is wrong and have asked me 3 times now to do the same things which do not fix the issue. I have spent at least 3 hours with them and at this point I just don't want it anymore.I'm still waiting for them to call back and, probably, ask me to do the same things again. I'm over it. I don't want to help Amazon fix their stuff for hours. I'm beginning to think I backed the wrong dog in the AI race.I hope I get to update this with an ""exceeded expectations"" report, but my guess is I'll be lucky to have anyone even meet my expectations: Fix the damn thing!",0
4,"Fantastic Speaker, Research Shows Microphone Mute Does Work!
  
",31.Oct.19,Yes,"I'm someone who *loves* the convenience technology such as this provides, but I must admit to being a bit skeeved out by the potential for abuse that such a device poses. While Amazon may not have any malevolent intent, the fact that a device, if in the wrong hands, can effectively serve as a cold-war era spy's dream bug in your house -- and one that you pay to have no less -- is disconcerting. However, research has shown that Amazon is being honest with respect to the mute button. Teardowns of the device show that when the mute button is applied, there is no voltage going across the microphone chip. This is very comforting, as there are certain times when having an ""always listening"" device isn't exactly an inviting thing to have in your home.As far as acoustics go, this device is excellent. It's quite impressive how Amazon has been able to pack in such a fantastic and well-rounded speaker into such a relatively inexpensive device. It offers enough bass, mid-range, and high-end clarity to easily be able to enjoy music without wishing there was a better speaker lying around. And for that alone, I'm grateful.",0
3,"It's called Echo because it comes with a loud squeal echoing on drop in calls
  
",31.Oct.19,Yes,"Great little smart device with a woman name Alexa inside a machine. I was watching someone's video in the comments here showing the smart light function demonstration (alexa turn on the light) and even my echo dot sitting at the corner in my room woke up to pick up what that person said in the video and told me ""Sorry I didn't find a device name light"". The only problem I ran into was drop in call sometimes doesn't work. Some restarting may resolve this bug but I hope it's not repetitive. I ain't not time to unplug my echo dot every time this happens. Sometimes when music is playing at 3/4 volume, Alexa won't hear me unless I yell at the top of my lung for it to wake. Overall it's an impressive small smart device. I can't wait to try out the smart plug and dimmable color bulb. We just need more Alexa controlled smart device like ""Alexa, flush the toilet"" without having to press down that filthy flush lever or ""Alexa, open the window blinds in the kitchen"" operating the blinds with a motorized device installed at the main headrail. I can go on but that's just giving free ideas to Amazon. I just love being creative. That's what I do, I drink and I know things.Update 10/31/19: There is a loud high pitch squeal  noise coming out of the echo dot when I drop in call from my Alexa app thru my android phone. Making it unbearable to communicate with someone with they drop in call me. Its horrible! 1 star taken away til they somehow fix this or I will just return it.",0
3,"Need the app for pc
  
",31.Oct.19,Yes,"So sick of having to try to get apps from Microsoft Store.  My win 10 enterprise does not have store and the app CANNOT be installed to get the Alexa app.  How about you make the software available more easily. Have searched over and over to get the 'app' for pc but to no avail. Really discourages me from making any purchase where I have to go to Microsoft Store. Yes, I know I can do it on my phone, BUT I DONT want to. Not everyone in the world is GLUED to their phones",0

",31.Oct.19,Yes,"After using this for several months (volume typically around a 5-6), the speaker sounds horrrrrible. The Alexa voice recognition is mediocre, but I like it being connected to my Amazon stuff, so that's fine. The fact that the audio is so horrible it makes me question whether or not I should go all-in on the Echos :/  I only have one of these echos, so I'm not sure if it's the model or just the one I have. Super disappointed.",0
3,"Its ok
  
",31.Oct.19,Yes,Overall its an somewhat of ok smart assistant. Issues: Integrating it with another amazon speaker is not easy/its pretty bad because it would either not play in sequence with another speaker or even worse is when you would ask for a song to be played on one speaker in kitchen for ex and it would play in a living room while kitchen one will be silent. Dont really know why it does that. Speaker vise its pretty weak but its tiny and packs fee features so expected. Another issue is phone connectivity. It would connect to the phone play music for like 4 mins and just silent itself. No matter what you do it wont play anything until you disconnect the phone ___ Rest of the features its ok. also when it does connect only one speaker will play off the phone which is annoying. Alexa needs to become a little smarter with answers too. Rest of the features its fine.,0

",1.Nov.19,Yes,"Finally, a clock that dims to the perfect brightness at night and brightens perfectly during the day and it comes with everything Alexa has to offer.  I have bought and thrown out so many alarm clocks because none of them can seem to get the bright enough to see during the day but dim enough to actually be able to sleep next to at night setting right.  But finally, with this echo all that is possible.  It is small but the numbers are distinct enough that they can be viewed from a long distance away.  Perfectly dims/brightens with changes in light.  And with Alexa you can set alarms listen to music, control lights, thermostat settings, get the weather, news etc. all from the comfort of your own bed.  Love it, just wish it came in more colors.",2

5,"Simply awesome
  
",1.Nov.19,Yes,Overall I think this was super value for money. I haven't used any other smart speaker before but I am very happy with my purchase. Below are some observations :1. Initially it feels a bit weird talking to a speaker but you get used to it in no time.2. The sound quality is pretty good. You get good depth of sound with decent bass.3. Several skills available and you will definitely find some very useful. For example adding stuff to shopping list or setting up a reminder.4. Understands the Indian accent very well. Sometimes I am amazed by how well it picks up stuff.6. Kids love it. An added advantage is that they can take help for homework and talking to alexa also motivates them to talk in English,0

Dont want to accidentally have something ordered.,0
5,"Promotion makes it a steal.
  
",2.Nov.19,Yes,"Well, I'm sure like a lot of you recently, I got my echo 3rd Gen from the Amazon music promotion. It's my first smart device that's not my phone or TV. I've only had it a short time (about 2 weeks now?) but I've had lots of fun figuring it what I can do with this thing. I don't use it much now already but I'm glad to have it when I need it. It's mostly for music and the speaker sounds nice enough, but having it at full volume sounds pretty bad. Still, it hits a decent volume before the sound quality deteriorates. I'm not gonna complain though for getting it with the promotion, but had I paid full price, I would definitely mark it down some. I have an off brand portable shower speaker that I paid like 15 bucks for that blows it out of the water in terms of sound quality at high volume (plus being portable is a big bonus for the speaker). That being said, it's not going to leave that speaker, the echo has its place in my room and the speaker goes everywhere else. There's a lot I like personally and it by far outweighs my issues I have with it. The biggest one is more of a preference really, and that's the power supply. I wish it was just a USB cable of some kind, not the kinda bulky brick and old school proprietary connector thing. It feels sturdy, mic range is very good, it compliments other compatible devices nicely, and Alexa said we can get married when humans colonize Mars soon pretty happy with it overall.",1
4,"The Dot is not perfect but surpasses any mid level or entry level devices.
  
",2.Nov.19,Yes,I wasn't sure at first as Alexa gives me a migraine that being said.Pro'sSound quality is optimal or better not bad at all even better when paired.Easy set up though it may be confusing as you need another device lucky i have a fire table.Voice command can be fun and convenientConnects to other bluetooth devices and or network devices like some tvs through your network.Can contact all your alexa devices at once note if there too close you may get feedback.Con'sSome possible confusion during set up need bluetooth enabled to set up dot on your set up device once set up disable bluetooth on set up device to avoid any possible set up conflicts with other bluetooth devices. once setup is complete you can still add other devices using set up device through the alexa app or by asking alexa  with bluetooth disabled as long as both set up device and dot are using same network.all interactive Network devices must share same network so if you want conference call with other alexa devices using a different network you will not be able to contact outside shared network even if in same house using same internet provider must use same network aka wifi connection to buzz all devices together.,0
1,"Don't trust it
  
",2.Nov.19,Yes,"We were excited to try this out, however, the same day we got it we saw all the reports that real people can listen to what goes on in your house. While the manufacturers say that a random selection of tests is conducted in order to provide accurate voice recognition, who knows what else is going on. This is one step too far for me. I am a boomer throwback I guess. I can't see the need for this unless she is going to clean the house. I can turn my own lights/music off and on.",1

",2.Nov.19,Yes,"I don't know why I have hesitated for so long to grab one of these Echo Dots...but I'm glad I did because I was able to take advantage of a special promotion and got one for $.99 cents when I got Amazon Music so right around $9...What a deal! And this thing is way better than I expected it to be. It has amazing sound quality and the volume is way louder than you would expect it to be for something that is just slightly larger than a hockey puck. I was kind of worried about setting it up because I figured it would be difficult, but just like all of the other Amazon products I've purchased, it was a breeze! And voice recognition is incredible! I really like this thing so far...",0

The bass in this is better than the Google Home Mini (previous-generation), woohoo.Con:When I tell Alexa to cut off a light, the air conditioner, or a fan, etc., Alexa cuts off multiple items instead of one single item.

Cant be alone with Alexa around.Update:  I have three of these and even got one for my elderly mother (she lives in a house in the back) and she can call me anytime she wants if she were to fall.  Its way better than the help Ive fallen unit.  She feels safer and I can drop in and chat with her anytime from anywhere.,0
5,"Much better sound
  
",2.Nov.19,Yes,I own both a second generation and a third generation Echo Dot and I think the third generation is much better when it comes to reproducing sound. The bass is surprisingly good for such a small speaker.I also find it very convenient having two Dots. My wife had surgery and must sleep in a different room while she heals. It's so convenient her being able to drop in on me if she needs anything during the night.,0
3,"Typical low-quality Amazon hardware
  
",2.Nov.19,Yes,"Short and sweet review:Everything about the Dot is great except the sound quality for music. Sound quality for music is really poor like it was an unimportant afterthought. The sound is muddy, unclear and uncrisp...as though the speaker diaphragm is made of brown paper bag material.This poor sound quality certainly doesn't motivate me to invest in a more expensive version of the Echo.",0
5,"Never too many Dots
  
",2.Nov.19,Yes,This version of the Dot is so much better than previous versions. It is hard to believe the audio difference in the 3rd ten Dot. We've replaced almost all of our previous Dots with the new version and those that we replaced in main rooms are being used as secondary and just voice control devices in other rooms. My family loves to have these around the house to easily get weather forecasts when getting ready in the morning to being able to have music whenever they want.,0
4,"Still needs a lot of fine-tuning
  
",2.Nov.19,Yes,Most of the problems are the unit not understanding questions or commands and or answers that are given correctly to trivia related games yet the unit States you submit the wrong answers. Should also be able to submit feedback through the unit without having to go back to the app and process feedback. Search engines are seriously lacking and normally either completely misunderstand the search request or have little or no information available. Keep working on it may be by 2025 you'll have this thing working like Google,0
3,"Clock adaptive (auto) brightness won't adjust
  
",3.Nov.19,Yes,"I have an Echo Dot 2nd generation.  I ordered this because of the new clock feature and better sound (and since it was on sale).  I just returned it for a refund.The sound quality was much improved -- richer and more bass.  The earlier Dot sounded tinny or shrill.  This latest one was much more pleasing.  This isn't to criticize the earlier Dot (since it wasn't designed as a great speaker), but to compliment this latest version.The clock feature is a great new feature.  However, when the brightness is set to Auto (or maybe that's called Adaptive), I couldn't adjust the level of this setting.  I spent over an hour in an online chat w/ Amazon to resolve this.  We did a hardware update, both Android and iOS Alexa application updates.  This setting still wouldn't change through either of the apps or by saying ""Alexa, set brightness to 1; set brightness to 10"").  The Dot would briefly show ""1"""" or ""10"" after sliding the brightness control in the apps or by requesting by voice, but there wasn't any difference in the brightness.I was able to change the brightness when Auto (Adaptive?) was switched off.  So, it could be set to say level ""2"" or whatever, but then it wouldn't adjust based on the room light.I'd like the brightness to automatically dim in a dark room such as at night; and be brighter during sunlight.  And, it seemed to do so, it's just that it was way too dim for me in all these cases.  I'd like to bump it up, but couldn't despite that seeming to be a feature.  Either Amazon should clarify that this can't be done or fix it.If it wasn't for this apparent flaw, I'd give a 5 star rating.If anyone has this feature working -- suggesting I just had a bad device -- replies would help others.  As for myself, I went back to my 2nd generation Dot and will wait till this is clearly fixed or is a non-issue.  My Dot works fine, so I'm in no rush.",1
5,"It works great, as advertised
  
",3.Nov.19,Yes,"So, there are not any instructions probably because all the new devices are coming up with their own apps and it would be impossible to keep up with them all and give explanations on how they should connect with the Alexa app. I have a new Samsung 42"" smart tv. It's smart app is called Smart Things. You are to connect it to their app then have Alexa connect to their app. It doesn't always work. She often looses the connection. I had AT&amp;T and several plugs and some light bulbs couldn't find the internet. My signal is too weak in my house. They said I get a 6ghz signal I could max out my signal at 10 but it wouldn't produce a significant difference. So, I have switched to cable for the internet. Now, the signal can be found kind of. The changing of the network with Alexa is lacking in simplicity. It searches for ever even after I have found the name. It gives the device it's own network name that ""isn't connected to the internet"", and no explanation as to why that happens and what it's purpose is, so you can't help it along. I got it connected with shear luck. But, this morning I heard my husband tell Alexa to turn on the TV and she did nothing, but responded with OK. This is a learning process. I hope I become an expert soon. I have several other things I would like to make smart. We are starting off small. The plug that works practically seamlessly is Amazon Smart Plug. That review would say, it is too wide!! It takes up 3 plugs on a strip. I tried a set of Teckin Smart Plugs. They couldn't find the internet, I sent them back. I tried Wyze Bulbs, CNET recommended them. They couldn't connect to the internet either. I sent them back. Alexa couldn't find their apps to enable the connection. Whether it was because I couldn't get them connected to the internet, perhaps that was all the trouble. None of this stuff comes with any documentation for troubleshooting. Very frustrating. I am very patient. I can't imaging how I would tolerate any of this if I wasn't willing to play around with stuff for hours. Good Luck, I hope this helps.",1
5,"Love it
  
",3.Nov.19,Yes,"Update: I'm not sure if this thing just had a bad connection or what but it works beautifully now. I have zero issues with it. In fact Ive purchased 2 more for my kids rooms. I can set alarms for them and send announcements to them. As well as use it as an intercom.I love this thing when it works. Unfortunately it only works about 50% of the time. When I initially wake it with a command it works great for about 15-20 minutes. If I'm listening to music, after about 15 minutes it seems to stop responding to commands. It will light up like it's listening but doesn't respond. For instance, if I tell it to pause, ask it to add to shopping list or set a timer it lights up to listen but doesn't follow through or comply with demands.  I've tested wifi strength and connection while it's malfunctioning and wifi is not the issue. Neither is location, as I've tried multiple placements in respect to the router with no improvements. Often it just lights up red and says it's having difficulties understanding me, to try back later. This is with zero background noises. I'm not sure If I recieved a faulty unit. I will contact customer support and revise my review once it is addressed. The sound quality is pretty impressive. It's  not going to blow you away but it fills the room.",0
4,"Almost there..
  
",3.Nov.19,Yes,"Clock is a great addition, and obvious improvement.  The only thing things is... If you use it for an alarm clock you still have to talk to Alexa to turn off the alarm.  You can snooze with the action button, but actually turn it off.  And while the alarm is obviously designed to wake you up, your voice talking to Alexa can be more of a wake up for your bed partner.  An off button option would be an improvement one step more.",1
4,"Alexa is like a Family member
  
",3.Nov.19,Yes,"within 1 day, Alexa felt like a family member. My son and daughter loved it as they don't have to ask permission to play rhymes or songs anymore; They directly talk to alexa :) My wife loved it as she uses it in the morning to play devotional songs and keep checking news/temperature. I loved the alarm feature and things to explore. I would say speaker quality is good. It picks up my voice better than kids. may be we need record as i did mine.Unfortunately someone stole the echo dot from our house 2 days back and we are missing alexa big time. I got it in a great offer and hoping to get the offer back in thanksgiving deal to get Alexa back. We miss you Alexa :( !!!",0
4,"Smart move for smarter house
  
",3.Nov.19,Yes,"Great smart device to add to home. Easy set up and fun to play with. It easily integrates with other smart devices and the Alexa app makes things a breeze. The only qualm is the parental control is not as extensive as I_ like. For example it does have explicit language blocking for songs, but I can_ cherry pick other songs that may not have bad words but still has inappropriate themes dependent on age. Other than that I love it and may get another to add elsewhere in the house (announcements and drop ins are awesome too)",0
5,"Mom Essential
  
",3.Nov.19,Yes,"I bought this on promo and i love it. My poor Alexa has taken on about half of the random questions i get from our four kids per day. How far away is christmas, what is 1 million plus 2 million, who sings this song we are listening to etc. The music and shopping lists are awesome. Being able to remotely access a shopping list is awesome since we were using a whiteboard i had to be home to see. We are only using 3 features so far and i am already in love.",0
5,"Pretty Happy
  
",3.Nov.19,Yes,Love this little thing. Great audio quality. Easy to set up and control. Only issue I have that is a little annoying is that it will randomly skip my songs on Pandora. It can go for a few songs then just out of no where skip to the next song. I've been turned off the voice listening while playing music. Same thing. Very strange.**Update** After using other music apps on my Echo Alexa hasn't skipped any songs randomly on Pandora. Not sure what caused the error.,0
5,"Great product can_ complain
  
",3.Nov.19,Yes,Love it I put it in my bathroom was thinking of replacing it with my google home mini In my bedroom but can_ because Alexa isn_ as superior as google The features aren_ there for me Alexa can_ turn on my tv unless it has a fire stick supposedly but google can turn on my tv even without a Chromecast.... even though Alexa hears perfectly unlike google.... don_ get me wrong they are both great products and use them both..... would love if Alexa could cast Netflix without 3rd party app,0
5,"Fun, convenient and easy to use!
  
",3.Nov.19,Yes,"We love our dots around this house. We have the original as well as a 2 and 3. These are such fun little devices. The capabilities really are endless. My kids use them daily to get the weather before getting dressed for the day. The speaker and overall appearance has definitely improved with the newer models. If you haven't used one yet, I would absolutely recommend you give it a try. I can't imagine you wouldn't find at least one feature you love.",0
5,"Alexa is fun to have.
  
",3.Nov.19,Yes,"I have found nothing to dislike.  I'm nearly 80 years old, so technology like this comes through my daughter, who sets it up for me.  But, the directions for setup were clear.  So far, I have used the Echo Dot for playing music mostly, but also for news briefs and timers.  I'm sure that the more I learn about it, the more I'll like it.  I always want to tell her please and thank you, so I guess she seems like a friend to me.",0
2,"Mehhhhh
  
",3.Nov.19,Yes,It is about a 50/50 % chance of it doing what I ask . it lights up blue reconizing I'm talking to it then does nothing at all it doesn't even say it can't help or any just nothing. other times it will do what I ask. When i play music it have the time will not stop the music and i will have to unplug it from the wall all together . the sound quility is great to bad it is slow and faulty,0
5,"Easy addition to my Echo Dot family!
  
",3.Nov.19,Yes,"I use the alexa.amazon.com application to chat with my Dots instead of a phone app. The setup routine easily recognized a new addition, helpfully labeled it as Dot 2, and I was pretty much up and running. The hardest part was to establish a group to play music with, so that whatever song I requested would play through both Dots. Here again the setup routine helpfully suggested ""Everywhere"", so now I just append that word to the end of my song request.",0
5,"Really worth it for the sound quality alone.
  
",3.Nov.19,Yes,"This new unit was added for a home office and it was a snap to set up. I'm really impressed with the sound quality! I also purchased the rechargeable battery that can go along with it. Now, I can unplug the power cord and take anywhere I want around the house. When I'm finished, just plug the power cord back in and it charges as it works.",0
5,"The hype is real
  
",4.Nov.19,Yes,"I've wanted an Alexa controlled speaker in my home for a long time. I finally pushed myself to get this Echo 3 because of a big sale amazon was having on them. It shipped in 1 day as most of my prime purchases and boy does it deliver. It has a large charging block head that is a bit tough to squeeze into a normal 3 pronged outlet spot. The audio on the speaker is incredibly loud, and quite when you want it to be. It's very clear. The setup and controls are simple directions to follow using the Alexa app. I've had a fire tv for a long time and eventually I was able to figure out how to connect the fire tv to my new echo. Now I can control it just with my voice! This did require download skills on the Alexa app to my echo, which at first I didn't understand, but the echo answered my question and told me where to find it! Fantastic device. If I ever get a bigger apartment with more rooms then I'll definitely get more for additional rooms.",1
4,"Works well, nice features, appealing aesthetic,
  
",4.Nov.19,Yes,"I received my Echo Dot in the mail and immediately set it up. I had previously purchased an Echo Dot for my parents and also lived with an Echo for a year. I bought this Echo Dot during a deal to see if I'd like it just as much as the Echo.For overall functionality, I say it works quite well. It can't answer all of your questions yet, but Alexa is generally knowledgeable about most topics and has many useful features related to personalizing your experience. I especially like the app that allows you to customize questions for any guests in your home that may need help finding things. I've been able to utilize many other features such as lists, morning routine, playing podcasts, playing music, setting timers/reminders, and others. I am planning on purchasing some smart home equipment in the future, but for now I don't know how well the integration works.As part of the deal to purchase the Echo, I also got an Amazon Music subscription. Unfortunately, the Echo Dot does not have speakers as nice as the Echo does. If you looked up the differences, this is a known discrepancy so I wasn't too upset. The quality honestly isn't bad enough for anyone who isn't purchasing it for music specifically to be bothered by.The other minor annoyance is that the speaker doesn't seem to be 360, as the Echo is, but unidirectional. This isn't a problem for me, currently, as it is set up on a shelf directed towards where I generally am to listen to podcasts, music, and audiobooks. I'm not sure if the microphone is also unidirectional, but I haven't had any problem with Alexa picking up my voice unless I'm in another room around the corner (which is expected).Overall, I'm happy with my purchase of the Echo Dot. If I decide to add another unit, I will be purchasing the Echo for my main living space, as I do prefer the 360 speaker and increased speaker quality. However, for a budget option or those not too finicky when it comes to speaker quality or direction, the Echo Dot is a great option for a smart home device.",0
3,"This little spot has a lot of personality
  
",4.Nov.19,Yes,"Siri, Google, take note: although I love you both in your own way, Alexa is actually FUN! The voice assistant lacks the robotic feel we get used to in other devices.Alexa will occasionally make a joke even when I didn_ specifically ask for one.Once I integrated her into my home, I found that she goes into guard mode whenever I set my security system to arm. It does not matter what device our operating system was used to arm it. The system automatically sets a lighting routine to mimic someone being home. Note if she would just turn on the television.My biggest gripe, and it is a big one. The skills, the basis of what allows you to integrate Alexa with other functionality appears to be poorly written for the most part. The skills store is filled with one and two star ratings and rightfully so. If the software can_ do what it advertises, your stick with funny and cute hardware wishing you could do the things it promises",0
1,"Awesome gizmo with a huge flaw
  
",4.Nov.19,Yes,"This is my first robot. I love the way I can just ask it any question that pops into my head.  Alexa,  what are the bones in the ear. BAM. Also, it is way awesome as far as playing music. Just wake the genie in the hockey puck and about 85 percent of the time Alexia comes through with whatever tunes you desire. Plays all the iTunes you bought, can dial up radio stations, sports, whatever, the thing is beauteous. Back in the day R Crumb had a cartoon about a guy who lived and rode around in his bathtub. I can see this ridiculously affordable device (two six packs) putting me in such a state.  Why think, why move when you have this baby at your side.  Nirvana.Why then do I give this game changer one star? Simple. I got a black one. I like black. What engineer was the genius who decided to make the four simple control buttons on top of Dot 3 , the EXACT  same black color as the Dot casing?!? They are unreadable if they are more than 3 feet from your face!  Are you kidding me? My goal in life is to not have one of the fitness circles on my Apple watch budge. At all. Ever. Every time I need to fiddle with the mic, adjust the sound, reset the app , (which you might have to do if it is unplugged) on this hockey puck in a dimly lit room, I have to get up and get a friggin flashlight to distinguish between the four buttons!! They just blend into the rest of the gizmo. Engineering  crew. You owe me 50 push ups. Doh!",0
3,"It's a nice Dot. Hard of hearing though
  
",4.Nov.19,Yes,"This is my 2nd one. I got an echo almost 2 years ago. Dot is very similar to the echo. Maybe not as good a listener. I have to repeat the wake word sometimes. I use it with Bluetooth connected to a speaker. It loses it's pairing sometimes. The little note that it makes to punctuate when it hears you is so much louder than the other audio I think it will blow out the speaker eventually. These are minor things, just thought I'd mention them.Mostly it is really awesome. I use it for listening to audio books while I cook and clean in the kitchen. I'm spending more time doing those thing, so it's making life better. I was behind on listening to my audio books, I'm catching up now.Just like the other one I use it all the time for timers and alarms. I am absent minded that is my favorite feature.",0
3,"Not bad, has some uses.
  
",4.Nov.19,Yes,So far i have been enjoying it but like most people it has been giving me some issues. The first is that it wouldnt give me local weather even though but on my app and online it showed my correct location i actually have to remove my location from both places and then put it back in before it finally gave right weather.  Even though if i asked whats my location it would say it right. it also has some trouble understanding commands unless i am right near it. If i say from other side of room play music it seems to get it right about 80% of the time.,0
5,"Please. Buy. This. Product!
  
",4.Nov.19,Yes,"O.M.G.! The Echo Dot Gen 3 is the best!  First, let me start on the voice recognition. It doesn't matter if you're having a huge house party where the music is loud, people talking, etc. The Echo Dot Gen 3 with Alexa integration will in a near instant recognize the call of her name and start listening. It is so good! I cannot even explain how much times I have been grateful for the 4 microphones that can hear my voice, it is HIGHLY convenient.  Next: the sound quality. The sound quality, I can say, is the best so far for a speaker like this. The sound is crystal clear and I can hear every detail coming from those great speakers, I have nothing to say except that you will not have trouble hearing the highs, mids, and lows produced from this speaker and will be satisfied with the sound quality.  Overall, the Echo Dot 3rd Generation from Amazon is by far the best smart speaker out the market out there,  and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone! Again, the smart speaker has amazing mobility for its size, the price is just right, the speakers crispy clear, and the voice recognition and Alexa integration just sets it way further ahead than other smart speakers out there!",0
4,"Great update
  
",4.Nov.19,Yes,"I upgraded one of my 1st gen Dots to the new 3rd gen Dot with Display. It's a great update, the speaker sounds way way better than the 1st gen, to the point you're kind of happy to listen to it. What I didn't expect was how much I like the display and having a clock visible at all times on the dot. I find myself looking at it constantly for time checks, it was well worth the $10 premium in price. All in all I'm very happy with this new Dot and will most likely get a few more to upgrade other units.",0
1,"Think I got a ""Bad One""...
  
",4.Nov.19,Yes,"I've had the item for about a week &amp; a half, and quit using it about 3 days ago. The sound on ANYTHING"" I request, from weather to music, breaks up within a couple of minutes. No song or sentence is complete anymore (worked fine for 3-4 days when 1st got it). Have jiggled the wire, used different plug-in locations and nothing improved. It's not usable. I'm assuming I must have just gotten a reject, as many reviews indicate no problems. Going to contact Amazon and see if they will replace what can now be defined as a piece of electrical junk.",0
5,"A big sound upgrade from 2nd gen dot
  
",4.Nov.19,Yes,What stands out the most is the improved audio. The appearance is also upgraded with the cloth surround instead of the plastic. It definitely seems to be a higher quality build. In addition the 3rd gen can be used with the amazon echo sub for added bass and you can pair these and use two together. Even though there are only minor differences (other then sound quality) between the 2nd gen and the 3rd the audio quality has improved so much that it is worth the upgrade. I enjoy using the echo dot and to recommend this 3rd gen over the previous model.,0
5,"I'm in love!
  
",4.Nov.19,Yes,"Why did it take me so long to get on the Echo Dot bandwagon? I had no idea what I was missing out on. I love that I can just talk to ""Alexa"" and turn on music to what I want to hear no matter what I'm doing. This is great when I'm cooking and my hands are messy and don't want to touch my phone to change the music. It holds a great charge that lasts a long time. And it doesn't take long to recharge. I usually just do it overnight when I'm not using it. It's nice and compact too so it's great for travel. I had no issues setting it up and no issues with voice recognition.",0
5,"Sleek,  spaceSaving, rich sound and price. My bad for not getting a smartPlug.
  
",4.Nov.19,Yes,"Like: full rich bass sound. Sleek and compact. Price. Easy set up connecting and pairing.Dislikes: confusing how it switches back and forth, I have to keep selecting Play On Paired Speakers.My last dislike is on me that i did not buy a smart plug.Overall,  a learning curve.This is actually a necessary practical purposeful purchase for me having adaptations in a modified home...the smart devices are a godsend.Cust service has been great with me",0
4,"Echo Dot Alexa Could be Better
  
",4.Nov.19,Yes,I really do like my Echo Dot Alexa but it needs some improvement. Mostly I just play music and sometimes the sound is not good and has an echoing or scratchy sound. I have Amazon Music Unlimited (and it sounds so much better in my car than on the Echo Dot)  and when I request a song like Michael Buble's new White Christmas version she always plays his old one with Shania Twain and I want the new one so Alexa is not up to date.,0
5,"A nice addition to your home!
  
",4.Nov.19,Yes,"Alexa is a part of our family :) She is very nice and easy to use. Only issue we have is sometimes she will talk to us when we aren't talking to her which makes my family paranoid that someone's listening and so they unplug her. I got Amazon music and I love it, I can hear any song I want anytime I want with no commercials. They also have stations for everybody's interest. Well worth the money!",0
4,"If you love quiet don_ buy
  
",4.Nov.19,Yes,"I actually HATE Alexa and the Echo Dot but it_ not fair for me to rate it poorly based on my preferences and not on its ability to do what it_ made to do. The speaker aspect of it is actually really great for me. I use it to listen to npr shows podcasts. It_ crisp and clear. Sometimes I use it for music.Why do I hate it so much that I don_ even leave it plugged in unless I_ using it as a speaker? I HATE having to talk to it.  Can_ stand it actually. Which I realize now is the exactly reason most people buy it. To me it ruins my piece and well-being. Introverts should NOT buy it. I had no idea before it arrived just how irritated it would make me to have to keep speaking out loud to it. If I use it through the ap i like it more but still not a fan.If you_e not weird like me, definitely buy.",0
5,"Useful gizmo
  
",5.Nov.19,Yes,"I have never been much for gizmos, but my wife likes them. She wanted one of these after hearing about them, so I eventually gave in and bought one. Set it up with her phone and that was pretty easy.  Now she yabbers with it like its her best friend. Truth be told it is actually kind of handy at times. Asking for the latest weather forecast seems to be it;s primary function at the moment, but I have also found it to be useful for settling disputes over this or that. I am surprised how quickly Alexa responds with an answer as well. Decent price and useful ? Win-win.",0
4,"Good for the price, needs some work on a couple aspects though
  
",5.Nov.19,Yes,"I bought this unit to compare the functionality of Alexa versus Google, of which I already have several devices. So far I've seen that it definitely has better long range hearing, as in it can actually hear you from across the room, and given the LED strip around the edge, it seems to actually be able to figure out a pretty accurate direction on where you're talking to it from. It also understands commands better than Google, though granted it can't do everything. Right now I have it mounted to the wall next to my stereo, and I used to have it hooked up to the stereo by 3.5mm aux port, but due to some issues with that it's just linked to the stereo by Bluetooth now. When connected by 3.5mm, songs will suddenly stop playing through the stereo, but the Alexa app says they're still going, and it seems like the only fix is to skip or restart the song. Bluetooth does not have this problem, however if I had some suggestions for software updates in the future, they'd be this: when the Echo is linked to a stereo either by Bluetooth or aux port, ALL the audio comes through the aux device, even Alexa just answering questions. I'd suggest putting in an option for the Echo to have regular Alexa voice come through its own speakers and music go through the aux device, at least giving the user a choice to choose from. I'd also suggest if that option became available, that the Echo lets Bluetooth linked devices and stereos sleep when inactive, and when given the command to play media, gives the wake command to the device before playing.All in all though, it's been pretty nice, definitely worth the price, and is definitely my choice for playing music.",0
5,"Reliable little smart speaker
  
",5.Nov.19,Yes,"We replaced a google device with this, so that our home is fully Alexa-enabled. The other device also didn_ seem to pick up our voices very well. In contrast, the echo dot hears us even though we put it out-of-sight and under a baby crib.We had some issues with other echo devices. The first generation echo couldn_ make out our words very well, and the new version of the show has some rattling in the speaker. I don_ expect products to be perfect, so we are fine with those quirks. No quirks with this little device, though. It just works.",0
4,"Some performance issues.
  
",5.Nov.19,Yes,"I've had the echo dot for about two weeks thanks to the amazon music + echo dot promotion. It is really an amazing device with very useful features. The reason I don't give it a 5 star rating is because, and I don't know if this is normal or just my device, I had some difficulty connecting with my laptop and wi-fi. Additionally, sometimes the device will become unresponsive at random times. I can't yet identify what it is that triggers this unresponsiveness. When it happens either it auto-restarts and takes a good 10 minutes to start working again or I will manually unplug and plug back again. Other than that I really like the echo dot. Very fun.",1
5,"Can_ live without it!
  
",5.Nov.19,Yes,This is my third echo dot third generation and now that I have them I couldn_ do without them! They make my life so much easier.  I love the feature that allows the echo to guard your home that way if any strange noises like breaking glass or fire alarms go off it Notifies you immediately and from there you can check in and listen in your home! I can_ wait to see what new features they come out with. I definitely recommend this device!,0
5,"You'll love it.
  
",5.Nov.19,Yes,"Upgraded my second gen dot for this Heather grey third gen.First thing I noticed was the weight, and althought I won't be holding it, I have a young child and 2 cats so the weight is nice to keep it grounded. In addition to the weight the bottom grips nicely.The sound quality for Alexa's voice, as well as for music is incredible on this beefed up hockey puck. The second gen dot is decent, but now that I've heard this one, I'll likely order another third gen to replace my bedrooms echo.The set up was easy, probably because it was linked to my account on Amazon, but if you gift one of these it shouldn't be a challenge for a newbie or someone elderly.We bought this one on a deal for 29.99 USD, and at that price point it's hard to go wrong. Ours is the one without the built in clock (Don't pay extra for a visual clock... Just ask Alexa what time it is.)",0
5,"Good for visually impaired me!
  
",5.Nov.19,Yes,"I'm vision impaired so Alexa is a godsend.  Setting my Dot up took 10 minutes and half of that was reading instructions. Simple, quick,clean Web interface (seriously good human factors engineering here). great build quality, I liked it so much I bought a second one!  Alexa is a big help, with reading my audio books, music, weather, reminders.. this device makes being impaired more livable.  Thanks, Amazon!",0
5,"My new personal assistant.
  
",5.Nov.19,Yes,"I don't know how I managed before this little smart device. I am hooked. I need more in my home. Anything I need, Alexa will assist me with. From reminders to recipes.  Amazon, Alexa is a the gift that keeps giving. Thank you!_ I want to write more about this precious gem. People this is honestly a must have. Do your self a favor and purchase an alexa devise you will have no regrets.",0
3,"Thought it would be smarter
  
",5.Nov.19,Yes,"I love the exercise reminders. I love the 7 minute workout skill. I enjoy being able to play music. But I absolutely hate every podcast player currently available for Alexa. As many podcasts as I like to listen to, the lack of being able to subscribe to them is a deal breaker for me. I can't even find one that lets me fast forward or rewind effectively. I really thought this thing was going to be smarter than it is. My smartphone is still smarter.  This is just a step up from a bluetooth speaker, don't get one if your expectations are high, you'll be disappointed.",0
5,"SIRI WHO??! lol
  
",5.Nov.19,Yes,"I ABSOLUTELY LOOOOOOOOVE MY ECO DOT! Everything from multiple timers, reminders, alarms, even notifications on when my packages arrive! __. This is THE  best thing ever I CANNOT WAIT to get another device.",1
3,"Multi language feature does not work
  
",6.Nov.19,Yes,"The device does pretty much what Siri does, except she has a harder time understanding or doing the right thing.I_ particularly frustrated right now because the multilingual function that just came out does not actually work. After speaking with 2 different Amazon reps 4 times, and doing the same diagnostics over and over again, no one knows how to make the multi language function work.  If the function is not ready for launch, it should not be launched. And if amazon wants to launch something, make sure your techs know about it rather than making me forward the communication to them so they can research and learn about this new feature.I feel embarrassed for amazon.",1
5,"Great little speaker with stereo pairing and audio out!
  
",6.Nov.19,Yes,"Nice lil speaker and for the recent deal where it was about $10 - totally worth it. Especially given the fact that with two, you can pair them in stereo - which is what I_ listening to right now! Bass is a little bit muddy when played at higher volumes but if you were buying these for their sound quality, you_ wouldn_ be going for the Dot. That being said however, these do sound quite decent for their price. Quite a deal better than my Google Home Mini. They also have audio out which I 100% appreciate and praise!",0
4,"Great Voice Recognition...
  
",6.Nov.19,Yes,I have both this and Google now and in some ways I love this more. The colored lighting is fun and it's definitely more sturdy and pleasing to look at. My only complaint is the difficulty playing any of my playlists either on Amazon or another platform like Spotify. No matter what I say it always plays the wrong list. I have to manually open the app to play it. Then it doesn't play it in it's entirety. Otherwise it's a great little speaker. It picks up voice much better than Google and has better sound quality. I'll be buying more.,0
5,"Better than 1st Gen by far, but still far from great.
  
",6.Nov.19,Yes,"Head and shoulders above 1st Gen unit, but still far from where it needs to be. Still getting ridiculous answers to questions, and home control is far from great. Usable, but not optimal. Ask her to turn on a specific light and she'll tell you it doesn't exist. 30 seconds later ask her to do the same, and she complies with no rhyme or reason. Still much better than Google Home which is having a plethora of problems lately.",0
5,"If you are struggling on google home assistance and echo devices read my review.
  
",6.Nov.19,Yes,"If you are trying to buy a smart voice advisor and struggling on google home assistance and echo devices read my review. I have both echo and google assistant and I have a nest smart controller at home which belongs to google. Guess what?  Echo can control the fan and google assistance can_.  Google don_ even support their own devices? So, if you are decided to buy a google assistance instead of echo. Think again!",0
1,"Sounds worse than the 2nd gen
  
",7.Nov.19,Yes,If I want better music I would get the full size one. This is a terrible update. Less crisp and really kill the clarity of the speech audio. I wouldn_ buy a dot for music and you really made the audio crappier where I have to make it overly loud to listen to the news briefings and such to get pass the voices now sounding like they are all muffled instead of being crisp and even tinny by those overly critical and wanting everything in a full size echo to be in a dot.,1
4,"Nice design
  
",7.Nov.19,Yes,"I like the design of this new Echo Dot. It has a better quality speaker than the last one for sure, but not quite good enough. I will have to compare it with my Google Home Mini. It doesn't quite seem to pick up my voice if I say it in normal conversation or conversation type volume, which could be a negative or positive. Maybe you were always talking about it and tired of it responding when you weren't specifically asking it a question, then it would be a positive. It could be possible that it is because of the environment that it is in.",0
4,"Confusing to set up a routine with an alarm
  
",7.Nov.19,Yes,"The only issue I have with device, aside from its slightly jacked up price, is that setting up a routine with an alarm is more confusing than it needs to be. You first create an alarm in the app, then you create a routine that is triggered when you dismiss any alarm within a given time period. Not exactly intuitive.Compare that with Google's approach, where you create an alarm and assign a routine directly to that alarm.Other than that, this Echo Dot has a permanent spot on my nightstand.",0
5,"So far I love it
  
",7.Nov.19,Yes,"For the price of 60 dollars, I was not interested at all in spending that much for something that talks to me. With the promotion, I had gotten it for only 99 cents. With that being said, I will continue the review without the bias of cost, until the end.The sound quality and voice recognition is amazing. It literally feels like talking to another person, and playing music is like I bought a decent speaker.Alexa has many features and can cooperate with pretty much every common app. So far I can say this and Alexa will do that.The one thing I don't like is the peace of mind that this thing is constantly listening and you don't know what goes on in it's brain. They say the mute button physically unplugs the microphone but it's not convenient to turn it on/off. The red ring is a pretty nice nightlight.There's a whole lot to talk about but I'd say this is a brief review of what should most concern the average interested consumer. With all that being said, 60 dollars is fair, but it would call it a luxury good.",0
5,"Integrates easily and beautifully  w other Amazon Echo devices -- inexpensively
  
",7.Nov.19,Yes,"There is absolutely nothing to dislike and most everything to like about the new Echo Dot.  Of course the speaker is limited, but look at the price.  For simply answering questions, weather, sports, even reading an audible book, the Dot is excellent.  For quality music, the speaker is limited.  Bottomline:  It took 2 minutes to set up and the Echo Dot plays well with my family of Amazon full size Echo devices, at a superb price point.",0
5,"Echo dot
  
",7.Nov.19,Yes,A great product that could use some work. I'm not a fan of the drop in feature. Even after contacting Amazon and getting help we still have random people dropping in. When connected to our fire stick tv the sound and the people are off which drives me insane and it's annoying listening through the speaker. I hope as we learn how to use it better I will love it more. I do like that I can play music without having to turn the TV on tho.,0
5,"Unbelievably useful
  
",7.Nov.19,Yes,"At all time, I do not know what to do with a digital assistant at home. This time Amazon offers 8 dollars, then why not. I bought it, brought it to home, set it up, and wowwww... Now I do not need to walk around or use my apple watch to turn on all the lights, but just call ""Alexa, lights on"" or ""Alexa, play classical""... WowwwwI recommend you guys to try it out even if you do not know what to do with it. You gonna find your life is so much better!",0
4,"Good - but not great.
  
",7.Nov.19,Yes,"I love this device for what it can do, but sometimes I cannot get the command right to get it to do what I want to. Sometimes it works and sometimes it does not.  Simple commands are ok, but I am still trying to figure out why it does not work sometimes.  It does not work with Spectrum cable service which was a surprise and sometimes I have trouble with getting my tv to respond.  I do however love listening to Amazon Music or Pandora through it and love being able to set the alarm with a command.  Maybe if I had gotten a more expensive version it would do more.",0
3,"Get Echo Dot with Clock or Echo Show 5
  
",7.Nov.19,Yes,"I got the Echo Dot to try Alexa smart system, &amp; after few days I got boring from using it.So I only use it to listen to Music, &amp; it offers good quality sound (not stereo), its like you put decent speaker under blanket.I gave 2 stars for Voice Recognition, because it didn't get my commands from first time many occasions.Moreover, while watching YouTube on how to deal with it, it recognized Alexa words from that video &amp; started to respond to them.Also I'm using Alexa on my mobile for easier experience due its less voice understanding for my requests.So I would get Echo Dot with clock, cause at least you see the time and temperature when you don't use it.and for little more money, I would get Echo Show 5 for more features and see Amazon Prime Videos.This device will be okay in the garage or bathroom or as secondary Alexa speaker.",0
5,"Alexa is part of our home now!
  
",7.Nov.19,Yes,"Our family uses Alexa for everything! We had the Echo Dot 2nd Gen &amp; just updated to the Echo Dot w/ Clock 3.5 Gen &amp; what a noticeable upgrade with the sound &amp; the visible display showing i.e. Clock, Temp, Timer, etc. We couldn_ be happier with this purchase! The Echo dot will be used for years to come! If you have a Gen 1, 2 or 3 I highly recommend upgrading to the 3.5!",0
4,"Super awesome promotion..... Although Alwcau
  
",8.Nov.19,Yes,"I cant wait to get more acclimated to this Echo Dot!  What an excellent promotion catch!  I do enjoy Alexa's humor, and appreciate the expressiveness.... Quite refreshing in comparison to Google Assistant's boring ""Hey, Google.."" ... Atleast Alexa has personality _....One thing that continues to bother me with Alexa is the fact that she won't play any of the music that I ask her to play... and worst of all, she tells me that I need to subscribe to Amazon Music Unlimited-- which I do not understand why it's like that, considering that the Music Unlimited acct is set up &amp; synced to  the Alexa app..... I mean, that was how I got the Amazon Music Unlimited &amp; Echo Dot together in a bundle deal so I kind of feel like Alexa should be on the same page, ya feel?  But she be on some other one hahah...",0
5,"I LOVE IT
  
",8.Nov.19,Yes,"I own several of these dots in my home. I love the intercom ability and the streaming music. This one is the BOMB! I had an ugly clock for 40 years that would just never die. I needed to replace it, but never found one that was bright enough or looked pretty. This little gem lights up the time brightly -- and I have bad eyes. It doesn't leave a big footprint either. It's perfect on my nightstand.As for the other capabilities, I haven't jumped into all Alexa can do. I must say she tells the best jokes.But KUDOS for the clock. I wish all of my other ones had it now.",0
5,"Alexa, a great assistant
  
",8.Nov.19,Yes,"I saw this Echo Dot as a promotion and I purchased it right away since I owned some items that can use Alexa to voice control. Very easy to set up. You can ask Alexa almost everything and the one thing I don't like is that sometimes it can't fully understand your question or statement and you have to repeat yourself in a way so she can understand and help find an answer. I also like the hands free feature. When I am busy, I can ask Alexa to pick up or call someone at that moment when I'm doing something important. It is an awesome product to have at your home as an assistant.",0
3,"beware you might get charged unwanted fees
  
",8.Nov.19,Yes,this echo device turns itself on when your not in the room.......I cancelled my amazon music unlimited because I have amazon prime......but still got charged $16.04 cause she said I was using it.......I told her to cancel it now and soon as I got off the phone the echo which is in another room with nothing on started talking and playing music......this is why I am not getting a refund cause this echo is doing stuff on its on......,0
3,"Not too sure about Echo
  
",8.Nov.19,Yes,"It has a slow response. Picks up background noise easily. I was setting up Alexa to recognize my voice and alexa picked up the noise from the fanNot really enjoying it but I have to say ""Alexa"" for it to continue or I need to sy ""Alexa"" twice or three time.Setting up alarms and what to play when the larm sets are easily done.Overall, I have mix feelings about this device.",0
5,"Perfect for my bedside table
  
",8.Nov.19,Yes,"My bedside table alarm clock was dying, emitting a horrible buzzing sound, so rather than buy another dinosaur I bought this new Dot. So far, so good  I can read the time from bed, plus I get all the usual Alexa goodness. It seemed like a ridiculous combination when Amazon announced it but it's actually perfect. Instead of having two things on my bedside table, I need just one.",0
5,"3rd Generation Echo Dot is better looking and sounds better with more range.
  
",8.Nov.19,Yes,"WOW, how these little hockey pucks have stepped up their game. I have an early Echo Dot that really looks like a hockey puck, and it works great.  This 3rd generation one not only looks nicer but it also has better sound and a wider range (volume) of sound.Connects and works well, like the others in the line.",0
5,"Leery at first of security concerns, but I'm onboard now
  
",8.Nov.19,Yes,"I have serious misgivings about the assistant products offered by Google, Amazon, and particularly Facebook. The usefulness of the Alexa / Echo system and integration with the Ring security system plus security / configuration options alleviate some of those concerns and I find myself enjoying using the Alexa / Echo products.",0
5,"Super Nice
  
",9.Nov.19,Yes,"I got this on sale with the Amazon Music Subscription for 99 cents. Even with the subscription it was like $8 and some change.I just saw a fantastic deal and didn't think about needing Wifi to use it...LOL!So unfortunately I had to cancel the music subscription a few days later. I know I still have it for the rest of the month, but I can't use it.I'm ok with that though, because it still was an amazing deal. So thank you Amazon for an expensive item that I got cheap that will make a super awesome gift this Christmas.We have a someone in mind that we know will get a lot of use out of it.BTW, it's a real cool looking speaker.Lesson...read everything before buying to make sure you can use it. ____",1
5,"The power of voice
  
",9.Nov.19,Yes,"I recently purchased a smart thermostat that came with Alexa integration. Before long, I was thinking of adding an echo dot in the basement where we watch TV/movies.  When I saw a promotion, I jumped on it. This device has moved the convenience of the internet from my fingertips to within earshot. This is not a hi-fi device by any stretch of imagination, but has decent enough sound for me to bring it in the workshop and play music occasionally. One possible negative: I had to experiment with the device location, maybe the microphones are too sensitive. The thermostat with Alexa is located on the main floor, close to the staircase. At first I apparently placed it too close to the stairwell in the basement, without realizing. I would query the thermostat and the dot in the basement would respond. After a moment, Alexa in the thermostat apologized that she was having trouble connecting, etc. On that topic, I do have a wi-fi repeater in the house so I can't speak for the signal coverage the unit gets. I am finding myself using Alexa more and more, for reminders, to-do list, calendar, news brief and sports. I am impressed with the ability to speak from across the room where the dot is, and it responds correctly. The thermostat's microphone is not that sensitive, in comparison.",0
4,"Not much of a difference over the previous gen
  
",9.Nov.19,Yes,"Works as well as any other Alexa device.  I don't really see the improvement over the previous generation though.  It still misunderstands about the same amount of commands as the older ones.  Sound quality of the built in speaker is better than the old ones, but still sucks.  I wish they could include a setting that would play music through the connected speaker (Bluetooth or hardwire) but use the built in for calls and drop ins.  It's not like your external speakers stay powered on 24/7....they get turned on when you need to use them.  It makes the drop in feature mostly useless in my house as most all of my echos are connected to amplified speakers that don't stay powered on all the time.  I'd like to use these as an intercom system, but..._nly big complaint on the g3 is the cloth cover.  Yes, it looks better than the old hard puck design, but it's a huge dust magnate and has to be vacuumed in order to clean.",0
5,"These devices have totally spoiled me... In a good way
  
",9.Nov.19,Yes,"This is a review of the new Amazon Echo Dot (3rd)If something ever happened to these devices, I would be lost. I have one in my catering kitchen to set reminders, timers, and other handy things.This new dot is in my bedroom; replacing my old alarm clock. They wake me up in the morning and locks down the house at night. My next goal is to link them to motion sensors, and have motion and changes in temperature trigger events; however, I am not there yet.Bottom LineThis new 3rd gen dot not only looks good, it is fully functional, and was a breeze to setup. And all at a great price point.What's not to like?",0
1,"stick to the first/second gen dont upgrade
  
",9.Nov.19,Yes,"I upgraded two of my first gen echos for this one. I am so disappointed with it. My first echo worked better than this one. It has a huge lag when you talk to it and freezes up a lot. Sometimes when playing music and you tell it to stop, it won't . you have to go in the app and manually stop it, or unplug it and restart it. When you wake it up with Alexa or echo, you have to wait like 10 seconds for it to turn on and give it a command, then when you do, wait a bit for it to process. meanwhile, I have the 1st echo, which I kept one of them for the bathroom, the first gen echo works way better and faster.. I may be going to google at some point.",0
4,"A quick and easy set up to get it working right out of the box.
  
",9.Nov.19,Yes,"The 3rd gen Echo Dot works well out of the box. Setup was straightforward using the Alexa app for iPhone. Bluetooth connectivity is easy, but I did have some issues connected it to a Win 10 laptop. In fact, I couldn't get my laptop to recognize the Dot. Integration with music services, Spotify, Amazon Music, and internet radio, Tune In, iHeart, etc was easy to set up and it worked well. My disappointment is with the sound quality. For podcasts, talk radio it sounds good but the range for music is more limited than I had hoped, especially with classical music. If sound quality is your biggest concern consider buying a different model.",0
5,"Few things can be improved but overall a great device for its price
  
",9.Nov.19,Yes,I honestly been having a bit of an issue with the voice recondition. I would call Alex while in the kitchen but she would not turn on and I have my device in my living room which is right next to my kitchen. I also feel like the sound should be improved it_ not that loud at all. I wish it can go a bit louder. But honestly overall I am still satisfied because I use it a lot in my room which I have no issues with the device when in my room being that my room is small. It  works  great in small areas of the home. I love that alexa can do a lot of different things such as set your alarm. Make you a check list tell you the weather and ext.,0
5,"Made my life easier
  
",9.Nov.19,Yes,"I can't even begin to explain how much I love Alexa. So easy and convenient compared to her competition. I love the additional accessories that can be connected to Alexa. She speaks like an actual person instead of like a robot. I can control Alexa from my app from other locations and turn on lights or play music for my dogs while I'm gone. I can add things to my calendar, shopping list, and she gives me a wealth of information. I loved it so much I bought a second one and they are synced.",0
5,"Perfect little desktop companion
  
",9.Nov.19,Yes,"My husband got me the amazon echo dot so that I could use it to listen to music. We_e had it for a bit over a week and I love it. Initially, we had it set up on our wooden desk, but found that the wood dampened the sound quite a bit. Once we put it on top of our printer, we_e had no problems. My son loves listening to his paw patrol theme song and I use it multiple times daily to listen to music while I clean and play with my boys.",0
5,"Much more accurate &amp; intuitive than anticipated!
  
",9.Nov.19,Yes,"Having been used to Google's Mini, it's taken us a bit to adjust to Alexa/Echo Dot, but not long, and we've been incredibly impressed. You can practically have an interactive conversation with it, vs. Google's always felt more 1-off in the commands/interaction. Rated sound at a 4, which is still GOOD for such a small all-inclusive-device, but of course it would be impossible to be a 5, unless I were to simply do so given the circumstances.",0
5,"Great for communication with chair or bed bound elderly
  
",9.Nov.19,Yes,"I am using the echo dot in the room of an elderly relative I care for in my home.  He can use it to call me on the phone.  I can ""drop in"" to make sure all is OK when I am traveling and he is being attended by home health aides.  He is a bit confused, and with this device there is less chance he'll use it in the wrong way.  When he had a medical alert pendant, he pushed it a few times for non-emergencies, bringing an ambulance to the house uneccessarily. With Alexa, he knows to call me, and if there truly was an emergency he'd know to call 911 (or if he called me, I could do it.)  He can use it to turn a light on and off. This echo dot is working really well for an elderly invalid.",0
3,"Don't bother to use for music
  
",9.Nov.19,Yes,"You would think that Amazon would have perfected the speaker in the DOT by the 3rd generation! I use my full size Echos for music and the DOT strictly to control my Echo clock (very cool product btw) and soon my Amazon combo microwave/air fryer (hopefully) in the kitchen but forget about any type of quality sound. Muffled, bassy and just plain junk for a speaker. Hey Amazon, get together with BOSE and learn a lesson!",0
5,"Alexa!
  
",9.Nov.19,Yes,"I wanted to put another small round assistant in another room, so I decided to compare google to Alexa. I already have Google, and the ability to listen to Sirius on Alexa was the reason I wanted to try the Amazon version.  Can_ say I can tell much different, but I think Google understands what I say better than Alexas. I would, however, say you can_ go wrong with either.",0
3,"Cant sync more than 2 speakers together and have to be the same speaker....
  
",9.Nov.19,Yes,"I would give it a 5, its loud and sounds great. BUT, you cant connect it/pair it with the bigger Amazon echo? Seriously amazon come on. Your amazon speakers have so much potential and were basically revolutionary 6 years back when you released them and now they're already obsolete because you dont want people to be able to connect them wirelessly... if you have the money go with SONOS, better quality than bose and has built in alexa features and you can sync them all together",0
5,"Much better than previous versions
  
",9.Nov.19,Yes,"I have a Harmon Kardon Invoke, with Cortana. As much as I don't love Cortana because she can't be integrated into anything, the audio from the speaker is AMAZING. I didn't think Amazon would be able to match it, and they haven't...but, they are getting closer with this generation. The sound quality from previous versions is very much enhanced.",0
2,"Not an very good alarm clock
  
",10.Nov.19,Yes,So with the added clock I thought awesome this could be a really cool alarm clock.  What found is that Amazon stuck a clock on there device without really looking at how it would be used.  My desire was for a alarm clock that I could wake to music.  Setting this up is possible but clumsy and quite glitchy.  I am still using it as an alarm clock with the hope it gets better.I have many little dislikes with but will only note the main ones.1) no physical way to turn off the alarm.  This by far was the most challenging to do when I first wake up.  Having to talk while my wife is still sleeping....2)  not being able to pick what music that will play.3)  the interface for setting the alarm needs work.,5
1,"Alexa will not play the same versions of songs on my Apple/ITunes Playlists
  
",10.Nov.19,Yes,"The Echo needs a little work. The sound quality tends to be a little bass heavy. Also, you have to say things to Alexa very precise or your request is not understood (one dimensional). However, those are things I can get used to. What I CANNOT get used to is Alexa not playing the same versions of songs I have on my Apple/ITunes playlist. I cannot tell you how disconcerting it was to have Alexa play my FAV's playlist, and instead of playing Mary J. Blige's Each Tear (solo), this awful male voice joins in for the second chorus.  The male voice sound so odd, I thought Alexa was possessed. I pulled out my MAC to check the version of song I had purchased years ago and it was correct, however, the song Alexa was/is playing is not my version of the song. So disappointed that this thing will not play my music.",0
5,"Love this dot clock!
  
",10.Nov.19,Yes,"This is just what I was looking for and everything I hoped it would be. I wanted to replace the old clock in our bedroom because the LED's were too bright to sleep. Well I saw this little beauty and thought it would be a perfect solution. I love the look of it! I dims at night so you can sleep, but it is still easy to read. It shows you the temperature when you ask, as well as the usual verbal response. It also shows the volume level when you change it. Of course the quality of the sound has improved over the gen 2 dot. Every time I look at it, it seems too good the be true.",0
3,"Don't ask it to recommend music!
  
",10.Nov.19,Yes,A.I. is not here yet. anyone familiar with programming will see this as IFTTT. I bought this device and a google home mini at the same time. The mini can still hear you at full volume while the dot struggles. The sound quality is better on the dot. I tried letting the dot recommend music. It was a disaster. it kept recommending the same stations over and over again. it was recommending top pop and clean alternative. I Don't want either of these stations. I tried disliking them and it kept recommending them. The only thing that it did that was A.I. like was after I cussed it more than I have anything animate or inanimate it just shutdown. I reset it and decided to use the amazon music app on my phone. I thought it may have been an issue with the app. The app had plenty of good recommendations so it was not the app. If you want something to turn your lights on this is a good device. If you want to explore new music this is not the device. You would think with all the data they have been collecting this thing would function better but it is not there yet.,0
1,"Bad Unit Do Not Buy One
  
",10.Nov.19,Yes,"I purchased this Echo Dot last Black Friday.  It worked at first, but did not work when I changed addresses.  I tried over and over again to get the Amazon wireless link on the install process to work-----but the option does not show up.I am pretty computer savvy and know this unit is dead.  Never dropped it, never abused it, just does not work anymore.I would not recommend buying the White Echo Dot.",0
5,"I like it
  
",10.Nov.19,Yes,"Does what it's supposed to do. I don't use it a lot. I only got it for one thing,  so I've never used it for all the toys . It's handy for adding things to the grocery list when my hands are busy. I think I'll get some smart plugs for my lamps, but that's about it.Edit: got a second one for th ed bedroom,just to add to th he convenience,  and they work well together.",0
3,"What time is it?
  
",11.Nov.19,Yes,"You get this Echo Dot, as opposed to the standard one, because you want to see a clock.  Yet, the way the clock is built into the side of this Dot makes it very difficult to see unless you are on the same plane as the clock.  If you are above or below it, the clock can be difficult tor read.  A classic case of form over function.",2
5,"The best Dot yet!
  
",11.Nov.19,Yes,This is our third Dot and our best.  This was purchased for bedside replacing an alarm clock.  The light is not so bright that it keeps us awake like the alarm did.  Setup was was almost immediate. The sound is superior to our older Dots.  Just tell Alexa what time to wake us and it_ done.  Highly recommended for this purpose.,1
5,"don_ keep her boxed in! she won_ hear you.
  
",11.Nov.19,Yes,"pros:- pretty decent sound quality!- alexa is nice and can help you with a lot of daily tasks- fast! a lot of different reactions to the same questions.- whisper mode is an amazing feature! great for when I don_ want to wake my pet.cons:- if you keep her in a sorta boxed in area (shelf, for example) her ability to hear you from afar is cut in half.- the noise it makes when you have a notification scares me every time- my family hates having one in the house because they think she listens to usoverall, i invested in one for speaker usage for music. over time, i became more comfortable using alexa for daily tasks, asking about weather, news briefings, etc. very helpful for a college student!",0

",11.Nov.19,Yes,This is our first time having any smart speakers and so far Echo Dot has been great so great that we now have two of them also we have even got some bulbs and switch_ that can be controlled by the Echo Dots everything has worked great together the ability to control the lights have came in very handy also the Echo Dots apility to play music from our Apple Music subscription has been a really nice feature to have and they are many more features that can be very handy in every day life I strongly recommend the Echo Dots to anyone that is wanting to get a small smart speaker to help control your smart home!,0

",11.Nov.19,Yes,"We have been in love with our Echo Dog ever since it arrived. The kid_ have enjoyed making requests to Alexa and asking her questions, jokes and riddles. I love using her as an alarm clock and to add things to my shopping cart. I was really impressed with the sound quality and love the bass that this little speaker puts out, it fills the entire room with high quality sound. I highly recommend it ",0
5,"Very loud alarm for my almost deaf ears!
  
",12.Nov.19,Yes,"I have trouble hearing, but I turned up the volume and asked her to speak slower and she did!  I still cannot hear everything she says, but my alarm clock did not wake me up anymore, so Alexa has a very loud alarm that I can hear. The speaker on this thing is great! My sister bought 2 of them. I tried to get calming music for my dog, and it seemed to work, even if I can't hear it.",1
5,"Say What?!
  
",12.Nov.19,Yes,"I love the Echo Dot. It's not just an Echo Dot it is a friend! LOL. Seriously it helps me out when I have to check the weather before my doctor appointments in the morning.  It comes in handy when finding out the weather in other countries as well, great for when travel. Especially if I wanted to go to Venice, Italy right now with all the flooding!. Sometimes when I ask it to play my albums from amazon music I have to repeat the name of the album sometimes, but that's OK I have to work on my diction anyway, really, I do. I haven't had time to play music from my Pandora account yet but once I get the chance, I'll let you guys know. Overall it gets a 5 star from me! Thanks Amazon for the Echo Dot!",0
4,"Pretty easy use and set up
  
",12.Nov.19,Yes,"My first time buying an echo and I have to say it's pretty awesome and easy to set up. I bought the smart bulb and outlets and it was super easy to install and is awesome to have. Alexa is pretty good at answering you quickly and quite innovative.Downsides, music quality is decent, but bass sucks. Also she can't hear you call her when music is on. You have to literally shout to get her attention.  Also her languages need work. She has trouble with her English/Spanish, Spanish/English modes.But other than that she's really great and helpful to have around the house.",0
5,"Makes life easier!
  
",12.Nov.19,Yes,"This was our first Alexa product and I have to say I love it! It makes the day to day easier and smoother. My whole family can easily add to our shopping list, we can get the weather and traffic  updates automatically when we dismiss our alarm in the morning, she has a lot of entertaining things to can do. I've even found a skill to help with learning languages. We'll definitely be buying more in the future. She does occasionally have issues understanding what we're saying, but repeating a bit more clearly usually does the trick. Now we just need to save up to make the whole house smart![My friend gave me a used gen 2 echo dot, and it definitely takes longer to get anything from it and it has a harder time recognizing what we're saying, so it's safe to say the gen 3 has improved from previous ones]",0
3,"Yahoo and CalDAV Support Nonexistent
  
",12.Nov.19,Yes,"Rather than discuss on the Alexa Echo in general, I want to focus on a significant limitation of the system. As scheduling is a big ""feature"" of Alexa, the fact is Alexa devices can only handle calendars from Google, Microsoft, and Apple. If you are not using Gmail, Outlook, or iCloud, then you will not be able to have any Echo device keep you informed about your appointments. There is simply no support for the Yahoo, AT&amp;T, or even the global standard of CalDAV. Alexa can not even access these calendar programs in read-only form, let alone add events to them. Additionally, there are no Alexa Skills or 3rd party apps that enable this ability, so there is no work-around this significant limitation.",0
5,"Handy device for all people
  
",12.Nov.19,Yes,"I personally use many Alexa enabled devices around my house and the Echo Dot is no exception. Although very basic in its features compared to other Echo devices like the Show or Spot, the Echo Dot is an effective entry-level smart device with Alexa integration that makes a great addition to any home and also makes an amazing gift for almost anyone, even those who aren't particularly tech savvy.",0
2,"Poor attempt to boost bass ruins overall quality of sound.
  
",13.Nov.19,Yes,"I feel this device was engineered in attempt to make it sound bass-heavy, but instead it sounds like you're listening to music being played underwater. The treble is decreased in attempt to boost the bass. Even adjusting the audio quality to decrease bass and increase treble in the Alexa settings does nothing to improve sound quality. If listening to music with someone singing, the actual words are barely understandable. You have to blast the volume just to make out anything a person is singing or saying.",1
4,"Echo is a good choice, but there is a learning curve
  
",13.Nov.19,Yes,"I have put the new Echo in our bedroom. It took a bit to figure out how to add Amazon music. Still trying to figure out how to add a radio station. I like the size, perfect for bedside table. It works great for getting the weather for the day. I used it once as an alarm and it was accurate on the time and woke me with music. Great feature.  Still figuring out what else I can do with  the. Echo. It actually had a yellow light the other day and did not know what that was, but by asking Alexa I got the answer . It was for a message . I then asked for the message which advised me of a delivery from Amazon that was delivered that day. I would recommend the Echo.",0
4,"She's a glowing bedroom creep.
  
",13.Nov.19,Yes,Good small unit for a bedroom. The annoying part is you cant turn off the notification or light ring. So if you dont clear the notification you get a nice glow all night. So not very good for a kids room or if your too lazy to ask a second alexa what are my notifications. I mean how many times can you ask her per device? Or at least give me a menu option to turn it off in the app. I do wish there was a grey or black version of this. Only other thing is alexa itself doesnt seem to be as sensitive as a alexa show when trying to activate or talk to her. Otherwise sounds great for a small unit and works like other alexa devices.,0
3,"Non-Standard Plug?!??!
  
",13.Nov.19,Yes,"I got this as part of a special deal.  I have plenty of Echo Dots, a full-size Echo and one of those useless Echo Auto devices, but when I unpacked the Echo Dot 3rd Gen, my very first instinct was to ask ""Alexa, what year is it?""  Whereas all the other Echo Dots have a USB plug, this one uses a specific (if not proprietary) adapter/power supply.  I think it's a horrible step backwards. Otherwise, I assume it's just like all the other Dots, which I recommend as far as functionality goes.",0
5,"Great product
  
",13.Nov.19,Yes,"I don_ know how I lived with Alexa before. I use it constantly and it_ a huge help in managing my day from shopping, weather and entertainment such as music, jokes and games. It does much more. I chose Alexa over other brands because the products we chose integrate with the Samsung Hub and Alexa which was very important for us...Samsung refrigerator, Kwickset door lock, Cree light bulbs, etc.",0
5,"Visiable clock a pluse
  
",13.Nov.19,Yes,Has all the functions of echo dot with the addition of a clock.  alarm volume controlled bu up down volume buttons like with a plain echo dot. More than adequate speakers for music.  Excellent value for the money.,1
1,"it pissed me off so much I swear at it.
  
",14.Nov.19,Yes,"So far I have found Alexa to horrorably. only recognize a third of the things I ask. I could ask it to do something and it will do it once and a will. I ask the same way that it worked, and then it wont work. I got really frustrated with Alexa on the fire stick. I hear good things for the dot. But the dot has pissed me off so must I can't help  myself swearing at it and calling it names and its creators. When I got it I called customer service, twice about different issues, that the literature said it would do, I used the exact same words that it had writen. that was 3 weeks ago. they said they will get back to me. still no call.Right now the only think I think is reliable is it is a paper weight and dust colector. I got it to control a thermastat. But my furnice is to old for that. I am trying to use it as an intercome system, it does an ok job at that.",0
3,"Voice recognition downgraded
  
",14.Nov.19,Yes,I bought this Echo Dot for a present because I really liked echo dot second generation I use it every day in my room. When my friend started using the 3rd generation I noticed that the voice recognition sucks!! I had to shout several times to get Alexa to respond and I never had that problem with my own echo voice recognition last generation. It gets really irritating when my own works great and a gift for someone important works not really well. I hope they fix this issue in the future. For now I will not recommend it.,0
5,"Love all my echos
  
",14.Nov.19,Yes,"I mostly use all of my echos to play music, or ask the time/weather etc.I recently upgraded all my 1st and 2nd gen to this 3rd gen.Sound quality is AWESOME compared to the previous generation.My only issue is when _ropping in my kids can_ hear me and sometimes when I ask Alexa something I literally have to scream at her. (Lol)But other than that I think sound is 100% better and quality is better too.",0
5,"Love the ambient light clock and easy operation.
  
",14.Nov.19,Yes,I already bought an Echo dot some months back and decided to get another one for the upper level of my house. I especially like the integrated clock and how it changes to show the current temperature when asked. It was easy to sync both of the Dots to play my music at the same time so I have music pretty much throughout the house. Convenient little devices.,1
5,"Long Live Alexa!
  
",14.Nov.19,Yes,"We will now have 5 Alexa devices in our house, and I'm absolutely thrilled! Ever since the 1st generation Echo, I've loved having Alexa in our home. Subtle improvements and new tasks keep Alexa interesting. Between the other three big names (Google, Siri, and... Cortana) Alexa is the most versatile. I'm very pleased with the quality of this newer model of Dot, and will probably upgrade the other dots in our house at some point. Long live Alexa!",0
5,"Way better voice recognition.  Love the clock!
  
",14.Nov.19,Yes,"I like having a clock near my tv.  I got this dot, bought some Phillips color changing light bulbs and moved my 2nd gen. dot upstairs to my bedroom.  Now I can say ""Alexa, TV lights"" and the lights dim, some change to blue, and my Hisense Roku TV turns on all automatically.  The voice recognition is noticeably different... I mean wow.  Even sitting right under my tv she does a great job.  I am so pleased.",1
4,"I like it...but it is also frustrating
  
",15.Nov.19,Yes,"I've got things set up in groups with only a few things to control right now.  However, Alexa can't seem to figure out how to turn on/off individual items in a group.  I have a TV and Light in my group ""bedroom"".  I say ""Alexa, turn off the bedroom light"" or ""Alexa, turn the light off in the bedroom"" or ""Alexa, Bedroom light off"" and it just turns off everything in the bedroom.  (or both items, w/e).  WHY?????  I can say ""Alexa, turn off/on all the lights"" and it will turn on/off all the lights in my house.  What is so hard about doing that from one group?  I set up a workaround and created a separate group for EACH light, and a group for each room.  Kind of overkill, but it's the only workaround at the moment.  Alexa doesn't like to turn on/off my tv without a group.  I say ""Alexa, turn off My TV"" and it replies ""Do you mean my tv?""  to which I reply, usually, with an exasperated ""YES"" and it replies ""I can't find my tv"".  Then I respond with ""Alexa, why do you hate me?""  or ""Alexa what the eff is wrong with you and why won't you turn on the one device you just asked me if it is the one I wanted?""  SO.  DANG. Frustrating.But, beyond all that, it's been pretty nice to turn on/control Pandora.  I like asking Alexa for Chuck Norris facts.  It's fun getting it to sing and answer silly questions.  Just not ready for prime time, YET.  Though after this long, will it EVER be ready???I want a skill where I can just walk into my room and say ""Bedroom Light"" and it will turn it on if it's off, or turn it off if it's on.  It's not hard.  It already checks the status of the light.  It'd be a single line of code to implement.",6
5,"Best dot yet
  
",15.Nov.19,Yes,"We got a 3rd generation dot for free when we signed up for a month of Amazon Music Unlimited. I don't think we'll keep the service, but the dot is nice. We have many dots around our house (living room, basement, bedrooms, and kitchen) but they are all the older generation dots. This latest 3rd generation definitely looks nicer with the fabric covering, and the sound is drastically better. I don't feel like the voice recognition is improved at all over the older Dots, but that's okay - we didn't have any complaints about the originals. All in all, I think this is a nice upgrade from previous versions, but I can't see spending money to actually upgrade what we already have. If you are just looking for something to answer questions, control smart devices, and occasionally play music, the dot may be for you. If you want better sound quality, look into the bigger and more expensive devices, but for the price this is a good one to get!",2
5,"I LOVE My Echo Dots!
  
",15.Nov.19,Yes,"I got one Dot on a special deal with Amazon Music. I figured I have wanted one for a while, why not try it out? To be honest I didn't know what an echo dot or Alexa really was, but I knew a few people with it and thought it might be cool to try out. Let's just say I am SOLD on Alexa! The Dot does so many things, controls my lights, my TV, my DOORBELL (which I bought after the echo because, DUH it is awesome!), it plays my kids songs on repeat for HOURS like they want. I love that you can program her to do anything. It plays music for my dog, I have set up a command where you say, ""Alexa, set the mood"" and she dims the lights, turns off the TV and turns on soft music.. She welcomes us home and listens for broken glass while we are not. I haven't figured out everything that she can do but I bought a second Dot 2 days after getting my first because they're so fun. DO NOT PASS IT UP!",0
5,"Echo Dot can be a wonderful assistant for persons with disabilities.
  
",15.Nov.19,Yes,"For a long time, I resisted what I thought was just a tech device fad. Was I ever wrong! The Echo Dot 3rd generation is incredibly useful and entertaining. Because I ordered the Dot in a bundle with a Sengled hub and light bulbs, I was able to immediately begin to make my home a smart home. I've been disabled for a few years. There are days I'm not able to be up much. With Alexa, I can turn lamps on and off, change TV channels, play music, listen to audio books, set timers, alarms, and reminders. Check my calendar and make shopping lists! That in addition to news, weather, composing texts, making calls, shopping on Amazon, listening to podcasts, and exploring lots of skills. I quickly bought a second Dot for my bedroom. I'm sold on these jewels.",0
5,"Lo mejor de Todo
  
",15.Nov.19,Yes,"Ya hace mas de 1 año compre a Alexa, nos ha hecho reír, le he hecho cantar las mañanitas a mi hija en su cumpleaños, este es un gran producto, lo que me costo ya ha sido pagado y super pagado, lo he integrado con varios aparatos inteligente, me ha hecho mas vago jeje dormido en la cama con pereza a ver mi celular le pregunto a Alexa que hora es y me lo dice, yo digo ahh sigo durmiendo jeje, lo ultimo que he hecho es una rutina de evacuación, cuando le digo ""Alexa Emergencia"" ella prende las luces abre las puerta eléctrica de mi casa y dice una rutina, yo viví un terremoto y durante el evento la electricidad se fue a los 20 seg, se prendieron las luces de emergencia en mi casa pero al llegar a la puerta eléctrica no pude salir porque ya no había electricidad, por eso he hecho esta rutina, que ella abra la puerta y si se va la electricidad por lo menos ya estaba abierta la puerta.Buen producto, gran soporte atrás de este producto, lo demás ustedes pueden saber en otros comentarios, gracias.",1
5,"Worth the money, great sound and value
  
",15.Nov.19,Yes,"I'm very pleased with my echo dot. I think the voice recognition could use a little tweaking, and I wish it was possible to add [dumb not Alexa-enabled] bluetooth speakers, but other than that, I have no complaints. Was pleasantly surprised and impressed by the sound quality and ability to fill a decent-sized room with a nice mix of highs, mids, and lows (I only use mine to play music). It's also really nice that there's a ""mute"" button on the dot, so I feel more at ease that my conversations aren't being listened in on or recorded as long as that button is enabled.",0
2,"Alexa - I thought you were supposed to be smart
  
",15.Nov.19,Yes,"While my echo dot seems to be physically well constructed and has decent sound quality when playing music. Overall though, I am very disappointed with Alexa. The sound on the echo dot tends to sound muffled when it talks. And when comes to answering a question or providing information - Alexa has a lot to be desired. It provides the wrong information or doesn't know the answer in regards to what I am wanting on a regular basis. This is supposed to be a 3rd generation smart device. However, my 1st generation Google Home mini has proven to be a LOT smarter.",0
4,"Love this!
  
",15.Nov.19,Yes,"Alexa has made my life wonderful in a week of owning her. My scrambled single mom brain can now focus on things that matter more like myself, kidding. But in all honesty I love Alexa. I love being able to set reminders and to-dos and shopping lists. Plus, my daughter loves the stories at night and opening boxes of cats. It_ made my entire life easier. Plus, setting up custom responses from Alexa tailored to my daughter and fiancé is totally fun. I love being able to tell my daughter she_ beautiful and going to have a good day in grade 5 every morning as soon as she wakes up.  The custom skills are totally fun and cute. I love calling everyone to breakfast without having to wash my hands or call my fiancé for coffee before the little one gets up weekends without having to actually yell and wake everyone up. You can set reminders for kids to take out the dog. Or feed them.  In fact, I set up an entire skill to help my daughter take on more responsibility with the dog. She can ask how much food to feed the dog, in case she forgets. She can ask Alexa what to do after or where she can find the dogs toys. Or even what kinds of treats to give the dog and how. The skill is technically for dog walkers or sitters however was extremely easy to tweak into _ocoas Helper and my daughter loves using it.  It works as intended, and I can change it as needed and quickly. I just can_ say enough...Alexa has really helped this household. We_e bonded playing quiz games and mad libs, we_e created chores and to-dos and, simply was *reminded* to do things I constantly forget like take my vitamins. All of these reasons plus the ease of functionality, it_ giving me more time in my day for family. I_ not losing a thousand cards from doctors with appointments on them and I_ surprised it actually works 99% of the time. It can only get better!",0
3,"Works pretty well, and was able to preserve my privacy to some degree
  
",15.Nov.19,Yes,"I liked that I did NOT have to personalize it - tell it my name, email, give it my phone contacts, etc.  While a little bit of functionality is given up, I felt it was well worth it.  But I had to be conscious of that when I set it up - it wasn't the default.  Integration with SmartThings went well.  Integration with EcoBee is functional, but needs some work.  The SirusXM activity provided no control over volume, which was a bit of a disappointment.  Voice recognition generally works pretty well.",0
2,"warning - uses proprietary power connector
  
",15.Nov.19,Yes,"Just got this to replace the echo dot we have in the bathroom because we would really like to have a clock in there.  The problem is we use a shared usb power brick to power the previous echo since that version uses a standard micro-usb connector.  With this version for some reason Amazon changed to use a proprietary barrel power connector so you are forced to use the power adapter that comes with it.  This is major problem for us since we don't have the extra space.Come on amazon, in this day in age there is no excuse for not using a standard micro usb or usb c power connector.",0
4,"Convenience
  
",15.Nov.19,Yes,"Product is placed in the kitchen for easy access for all members of the family.  Setup was easy including the voice recognition and parental control (wouldn't want anyone ""accidentally"" ordering items on my account...lol).Dislike:  Have a daughter with a similar name to Alexa so every time her name was said Alexa would answer, so we had to change the awake name ( should be an option to enter a awake name instead of only being able to choose from the list).",0
4,"Cute smart speaker
  
",15.Nov.19,Yes,"This is my first Echo device, and I like it so far. The sound quality is not as good as my portable Bose speaker, but that_ okay. I wasn_ expecting it to be, and I bought it more for its Alexa capabilities. The only other con is that it has to be plugged into the wall at all times. I would prefer a rechargeable battery so that it was easier to move around. But overall, I_ happy with my purchase. It_ a cute little speaker and I_ having fun learning all of what Alexa can do. And for those worried about privacy issues, it does have the option to turn the mic off.",0
5,"Alexa for president
  
",15.Nov.19,Yes,Duuuuude Alexa is my homegirl (Amazon feel free to market that and throw it on some T-shirt_ just give me a lifetime prime membership and we_l be even) anyways I love this especially the third GEN has the best speaker quality. We have several in our house and I love the intercom feature it works good with telling kids to come to the kitchen etc. Amazon really does need to put out a little pamphlet though with all the different features I just learned how to work my fire TV stick to the one in our living room and also how to play The same song throughout the house On multiple echoes. I feel like there_ more I could utilize with this and I_ constantly with learning but I like it a lot.,0
5,"Love the clock feature. Worth the upgrade. Sound is better than gen2.
  
",16.Nov.19,Yes,"Edited:I bought this to replace clock on my nightstand = less clutter. The form factor is perfect as an alarm clock replacement. I didn_ buy to play music exclusively, so it wasn_ going to be a deal breaker. I initially thought sound was muffled. I just found audio adjustment in app which helped a little. I_ impressed with being able to fine tune.  The adaptive brightness is a nice feature.  Amazon, please allow adaptive to adjust to full brightness as it does when adaptive is turned off. I think the clock feature is worth the upgrade if you want to clear out that clunky alarm clock from last century.Update:Received a replacement echo dot as I had reported the sound was muddled. Amazon just sent the actual dot and not a new package, so I am hoping this is a brand new device and not reconditioned. The sound is much, much better. Almost like night and day. If I could guarantee I could get another dot that sounded this good, I_ buy additional. The one issue is playing music from Pandora, the music will randomly stop and then restart maybe a minute later. This is not an issue when playing Amazon music.",1
5,"Love it!
  
",16.Nov.19,Yes,"Love my echo dots I just bought another one so now I own 2, love love love my echo dots! That_ all I can say, just buy one you won_ regret it! I mean sometimes you have to repeat yourself but it sets multiple timers so say you are cooking 3 different things and they are done at 3 different times you can set 3 timers, it tells you fun facts and more, it will control you fire stick to an extent, it connects to you Apple Music so all you have to do is tell it to play your Apple Music and whatever playlist you want, it is wording sensitive so you have to say Alexa play my Arab playlist and it will play it but if you say play my Arab music it will create a station and play something similar from Apple Music, it connects to the ring if you have one or plan to get one it gives you reminders if you set them like a calendar, it will remind you of weekly errands, you can make a shopping list the list goes on!",1
2,"Just Not Reliable
  
",16.Nov.19,Yes,"I bought this Echo Dot with the intention of using it as an alarm clock in the bedroom.  I was all excited to use my Spotify playlists as an alarm.  I have tried at least 20 times to set an alarm using my Spotify playlists, but it hasn't worked- not even once.  It shows the alarm on the Alexa app, but never plays.  Just to see if it would work, I tried the same thing on my Google Home, and it worked on the first try.  To add to the problems, I recently had to reset my internet and the Echo Dot couldn't reestablish a connection.  So, if the home internet ever cuts out in the middle of the night, the alarm won't work.  So, if you are the type of person that is OCD about checking to see if your alarm is turned on (like I am), now you'll spend all night wondering if the alarm is going to work in the morning.  I really don't think that I am expecting too much from my Echo Dot, but it still failed to meet those low expectations.",0
3,"A little better looking, still a ways to go with voice recognition...
  
",16.Nov.19,Yes,"I like the styling of the Gen 3 model.  Definitely a step up.I don't like the sound.  Amazon tried to make it sound ""fuller"" but it really just comes off as muffled/bassy.  I'm a sound engineer, so maybe I'm being too particular, but even tweaking the settings as best I can, it still sounds way too bottom heavy.I have a neutral American english accent and voice recognition is maddening for the most part.  You have to assume that's the state of the art right now and I doubt competitors would do any better.  I don't think the additional microphone helped.  Some day...",0
4,"Took a while to set up.
  
",16.Nov.19,Yes,"I like the 3rd generation Echo Dot more than my 2nd generation Echo Dots.  Better sound, nicer looking and better voice recognition.  The only problem was setting it up.  I kept having problems and had to keep turning of the Echo Dot, and redoing the set up.  It took about 2 hours, where as the older model took about 15 minutes to set up.I am happy with my 2nd gen Echo's and didn't need the 3rd gen.  Except I got a special deal when I signed up for Amazon Music Unlimited.",0
4,"Great for Music
  
",16.Nov.19,Yes,I just use mine for playing music on Amazon Prime and it works very well. The quality of the speaker isn't sufficient for music but it is fine for other uses. This unit looks nicer than the older units. It can be finicky sometimes when trying to connect to another Bluetooth speaker. I hope this one holds up longer than my earlier version that only lasted a year.,0
2,"Sound is good but voice activation terrible compared to 2nd gen
  
",16.Nov.19,Yes,I bought this and was immediately impressed by the sound difference from 2nd gen version. But then it using it I was upset bc it doesn_ hear your voice. I have to scream right above it to make it command. And sometimes that doesn_ work. Tech told me reprogram which helped zero percent. I have two request for a replacement but still being told to call tech. Not happy.,0
5,"Alexa...
  
",16.Nov.19,Yes,"What is there not to love about the Echo Dot? It is easy to set up, and use. Ask Alexa just about anything... She can make you life easier and less mundane. Why look up something on the internet? Just ask Alexa to do it. She will then read out loud whatever your query is. Need a recipe, Alexa can find it. Need to play your favorite song? Alexa can do that to. The possibilities are endless.",0
3,"Gen 2 is better for general use
  
",17.Nov.19,Yes,"Traded in my gen 2 for this because it stopped turning on for me and although the 3rd gen looks nice I personally think the gen 2 is better overall. Sound quality on this one sounds muffled but music comes through nicer. I feel this one has a harder time hearing you than the gen 2 did. Performance over all I would say is about the same as the gen 2 but seems to have some bigger issues than I'd like. Note: I only use Alexa for music, questions, wheater and other small features. I don't have any smart home features she can work with so I don't have any input on it.",0
3,"Great product except for having to plug into AC outlet.
  
",17.Nov.19,Yes,The Echo Dot 3 is the first time for me using the Alexa app.  The quality of the Dot is very good.  It works well and was easy for me to learn how to use.The only drawback is that you have to plug it into an AC outlet to use.  Therefore it's not useful in automobiles which are not equipped with an AC outlet.,1
5,"Blind Man Loves It!!!
  
",17.Nov.19,Yes,"I got this for my blind man. He fought all of us learning new electronics. For him this is magic...Took to it like a baby duck to water. He can ask Alexa any question, play any song he wants to hear, he doesn't care about turning on lights or that kind of stuff because it means nothing to him he is blind. He also asks her to call whom ever I set up in my smart phone, Alexa knows my voice also!",0
1,"too many bugs due to network updates. customer support was of little help.
  
",17.Nov.19,Yes,"1 star because it started acting up and I had to reset all echo dots within a month presumably because of an update they pushed through. customer support was of no help made me jump through many hoops yet it still shows a ""network error"" after 2 hours of talking to 10 people (I kept being reconnected to another person). not impressed and regretting the switching from google home.",0

",17.Nov.19,Yes,We love our Alexa and By us placing her in the living room she can hear us through the whole house. I am still trying to hook up my security cameras to her as they havent wokred wince we got her but will hook them all up and link them soon enough. Im sure it's something I am over looking. But dont have anything negative to say about this 3rd generation Echo.,0
3,"Not useful without paid subscriptions
  
",17.Nov.19,Yes,"I like the simplicity of just asking out loud verses turning on multiple devices. Problem is a lot of the things I wanted to make easier require multiple subscriptions to various other services - like Amazon Music, etc. For the few things it will do for free, it's alright. I got it on sale so I am ok with what I paid for it verses what it can do for free.",0
5,"Is there anything better than Alexa?
  
",18.Nov.19,Yes,"I stupid love these things.  I have six now (five of the dot 2 and one of these) and two more will be added soon.  Most likely black friday, but I usually try to get them in a bundle with another product I want.  Can't get enough!  Partnered with your Christmas lights through a smart plug (the best use of this thing on the planet).  Turns my TCL Roku tv off and on (opens apps, etc), morning routines (turns on the lights and music in my sleepy daughter's room) reminders, alarms, timers, play music all day long, alerts to trash day/time for kids to clean up before we get home, etc.  The amazon package alerts are great, too.

2,"Acted Peculiarly--Suspected It Picked Up Signals From Neighboring Devices
  
",19.Nov.19,Yes,"The Echo Dot was very easy to set up and had decent sound.I had three problems.  First, she didn't seem to understand many commands.  Second, she often was doing stuff I didn't ask her to.  She woke me up today playing Rio by Duran Duran.  I did not program this in any way.  Another day, she kept babbling on and on about how many things were black--ants were black, dirt was black, etc.  I don't know why she was doing that.  Another thing I didn't ask for.  Perhaps she was picking up neighboring signals?Which brings me to the third problem.  Alexa seemed to be constantly in communication with our AI Robot.  The house would be quiet.  We wouldn't say the wake word, and suddenly his screen would show the Alexa symbol.  Now, while I'm not that worried about being spied upon because frankly I'm too boring, I'm not sure this wasn't causing the peculiar behavior.  I suspect that the 3rd Generation Echo Dot is too sensitve in picking up other signals.  Not only can this be a security risk, but it interferes with performance of not only the Dot but other devices.",0
2,"MOST FRUSTRATING
  
",19.Nov.19,Yes,"If you just want an alarm clock or listen to music, this is the item for you. But forget it if you want to use it for anything else. Setting up anything is a chore. Using the skills is like a bad relationship with Siri. They make it seem like you can talk to it like a human, but if you don't remember the actual name of the skill you want to use, and say  ""tell ______ to log ______"" it does something else entirely or says it's not sure. If by chance it opens the correct skill, you have to listen to a song and dance while it introduces the skill and asks you what you want - every time. I tried to use it for a diet and and had to enable and disable 6 skills before I realized that not one of them could log my food, count my calories and keep track of my weight all in one skill. I ended up having to use 3 separate skills. I could have jotted it down on a piece of paper 10 times faster.  My suggestion to Echo Dot is to cut out the small talk, make it really recognize what we're saying and remove all the half-assed skills until they're actually usable.",0
4,"Echo Dot (3rd Gen) acts just like (2nd Gen).
  
",19.Nov.19,Yes,"I was disappointed with Amazon Music Unlimited.  Or perhaps I was disappointed with Alexa telling me when my music requested was coming from Amazon Music Prime or Unlimited.  ""She"" never told me that she was playing music from Unlimited, making me question why I was paying for the service.It took me a while to find the unsubscribe method for AMU, but when I did I used it.  I wasn't going to risk not being able to find it in the future.The Echo Dot is great, and for such a tiny device has great sound.  The Alexa part is as good on this dot (3rd gen), as it is on my Echo.  as on my Echo Show (1st Gen).  as on my Echo Auto.  as on my parent's Echo Show (2nd Gen, 10"").  as on my two Echo Dots (2nd Gen).  You get the point?  Alexa is Alexa.I have not figured out how to get the clock to display, making me think I was sent a 2nd gen, instead of 3rd gen.When someone makes the Jetson's maid available, I hope she comes with Alexa.",0
3,"Wait for 2nd Gen (Display Issues, No Music)
  
",19.Nov.19,Yes,"The echo dot with clock is a great concept, but fails a bit in form. The clock, which is what we're buying it for, is insufficient. It says it has adaptive brightness that learns your preferences, but still hasn't. During the day, I can't see it in a moderately bright room.  At night, it's adequate. You can also say 'alexa, brightness up' or down depending, but unless you fidget in the app, it's not terribly noticeable.Sound is what you'd expect from a dot. Decent enough to get the job done. Since this is in a bedroom dot, probably wouldn't be too dependent on it except for alarm but......you can't set a song or music as alarm. Just the generic alarm tone for alexa. WHY? this may be the biggest failing. No radio (even thru an app) and no wake to music.Probably returning this. Should have waited for v2.",0
4,"Alexa makes life easier
  
",19.Nov.19,Yes,"I've really enjoyed my Alexa. I use her with apps, contacts, skills and with a house full of smart plugs. I just don't like how I have to use a full command for every interaction. For example, I'll say, Alexa Enable Ambient Noise. She'll say, okay, what sound would you like? I'll say, Combine Pink noise with Light Rain. But if I want to change the sounds, I have to repeat the whole process. There are no real command shortcuts. Also, she doesn't do really important things like connect with your security system or call 911. Just think of Alexa as a Lite-Application. Lastly, the programming or ""Routines"" only work half the time.",0
5,"Loud, Small, Easy to Use Once Set Up
  
",19.Nov.19,Yes,"Had some issues with initial setup, but was able to work through it. Once set up, easy to use. We have 2 in our home and my wife has one she uses as strictly a bluetooth speaker at work (we got them on sale). They're nice a small, don't take up too much space, but they are still plenty loud. Would recommend that Amazon add a custom commands functionality to the Alexa app. Allow users to set up specific voice commands. For example, we use PlayerFM for podcasts, but there is not a PlayerFM skill. Would love to set up a voice command to open PlayerFM and play a specific podcast like ""Alexa, PlayerFM listen to _____ podcast""",0
2,"Alexa is kinda dumb and sneaky!
  
",19.Nov.19,Yes,"1- Alexa was set up without app or phone, but somehow gained access to my contact list from the ""cloud"".  I did not want alexa to have my contacts, as i have heard of issues with unintended calls at inopportune times.I had to call Amazon to disable this and erase contacts (no way to do on your own)2- almost every time i ask alexa something, she know nothing.  I have to go and google it.-- only good for listening to music. telling you someone is at the door (with ring) etc..-- a dumb and sneaky radio.. (that's how i see it)-- maybe ok for light controls -- if that is your thing.",0
4,"Great deal for under a buck, but can anyone tell me more uses for Alexa?
  
",19.Nov.19,Yes,"This is my first smart speaker. After getting I realized they had ones with clocks which I wish I had gotten, but I got that deal where I got echo dot for .99 cents. I don't use Alexa a lot but maybe more and more when I see uses I will. I have since gotten a smart bulb so when I come home the apartment isn't totally dark. I do simple things like ask her for weather or play 80's music",0
5,"Life changing addition to our home
  
",20.Nov.19,Yes,"LOVE&gt;LOVE&gt;LOVE!Excellent and life changing. As a mom of 4. And as a full time home renovator, this product changed my life. I always have paint , grout, cement or wood stain on my hands and struggled to change my music while working without stopping everything to wash and dry my hands. I am an EXTREMELY impatient person and rush to do everything. Stopping, to change music was extremely frustrating and time consuming. I no longer have to stop to text. stop to write a grocery list! ! Stop to change the music!  (Alexa actually sends my grocery list to me so i can access it while at the store!) Holy cow! My two teenagers and toddlers also use Alexa constantly for entertainment. My 3 year old knows how to access alexa's capabilities and often commands her to play her favorite elmo tunes and so on! 100% worth the buy!",1
5,"Great!
  
",20.Nov.19,Yes,"We have been wanting a third Alexa for a long while to go in our office. Our other two are in the bedroom and kitchen. We ordered the darker grey cloth-y one, and it has amazing sound! It's honestly almost as good as the bigger one we put in the kitchen. The only complaint I can think of (and its not enough to even drop a star off) is that if you have the Alexa up high, sitting flat on a shelf for example, you can barely see her light up at that angle.This would have been a bigger deal with our first Alexa dot, because she was a lot harder of hearing. ""Alexa... ALEXA.... ALEXA!!"" lol It still sometimes take a while to get her to light up, showing that she is listening. (But when she lights up, it is very bright! And you can see it at all angles.) But this newer generation is a lot more sensitive to our voices, so it is never a problem not seeing her light up.I also added a pic for reference from sitting in the chair looking up. She is kinda hard to see, the snowman is sitting on top of her at the moment, to the right of the snowglobe. Second photo should be her lit up at the same angle sitting in the chair, and then the third photo is at a higher angle to show her lit up better. I don't know if it is just a more dim light than the other ones, or whether the light just doesn't come down the side as much? It doesn't bother me too much, and I doubt it bothers too many other people, but that is really the only negative difference between her and my other two Alexas. Her quality of sound more than makes up for it!",0
5,"Best Addition to our Home!
  
",20.Nov.19,Yes,"I never knew I needed an Alexa until I had one! I actually went on to purchase a second one, so we have one in our bedroom and our kitchen now. The alarm clock has been a game changer for me! I also got some bluetooth lightbulbs for our master bedroom that I've hooked up to it, so I can control them by just saying ""Alexa turn off master bedroom lights"" So cool! My favorite thing is that you can set a routine up. Every morning when I tell Alexa to turn off the alarm, the turns on my bedroom lights automatically, then tells me the weather, then reads my schedule, and then starts playing my favorite playlist.",0
4,"I can't call it
  
",20.Nov.19,Yes,Ok well got 2dots 3rd generation smart homed everything everything is fine go to bed wake up and 1 of the 3 light bulbs wont come on when you add a routine sometimes she say it most times she wont not that ez to connect devices also you would think she knows just as much as google knows but she dont i don't know what to tell u but it takes a lot of work to make it work and alot of work to keep it working its not 1 day you can use it and everything works fine,0
3,"Alexa, 3rd Gen: Sensitive, yes, but leaves me flat
  
",20.Nov.19,Yes,"Great pickup, even from across rooms. Voice commands are even more varied than before.  Clock is a nice touch, although the Dot sits too low on the dresser to be of much use. BUT...I bought it for the sound, and it's flat. Tried varying base and treble, but it's just too muffled for my ears.  Even asked my wife if it was just me: it's not. Will be trying to hook up an auxiliary speaker, but I shouldn't have to.",1
5,"Wifi set up doesn't work well if you have an android
  
",20.Nov.19,Yes,Works really well. Volume adjusts very load and clear speaking. I am happy with this. We had to use an iPhone to get it connected to my wifi because my android wasnt working with connecting the alexa. Luckily my daughter was home air we were easily able to get the Alexa working. Besides being frustrated with failing attempts to connect wifi through my android! I am happy with how this product works,0
1,"Does not work with Philips Hue, period.
  
",20.Nov.19,Yes,"When adding to an existing ecosystem, be aware this does not work with Philips Hue. I have tried everything that everyone on the interwebs suggests to no avail. How annoying, and surprised Amazon lets this go. Works with everything else I have among 3 thermostats, Orbit sprinkler controller, Roombas, WeMo, Sonos, TiVos, but not Hue. Come on, Amazon, really?",0
5,"Haunted Alexa
  
",21.Nov.19,Yes,"This is the third Alexa Dot to join my family. The first one went into my son_ room so he could listen to music. I bought the second one for myself after realizing how amazing it was (and there was a sale). This is the third one I also got with a sale which I now have on my bar between my kitchen and dining room. My living area is an open space. There are two living rooms, a kitchen, dining room and office all basically in the same room so I thought putting it in the kitchen would be perfect because it_ away from the electronics but close enough I can talk to it. I_ going to speak about all the good things about it first and then get to the haunted part. My Alexa_ are all hooked up to my ring devices. Whenever there is motion it informs me. I love this because I don_ usually carry my phone on me inside. Now I know when someone is in my yard no matter what room I_ in. I have alarms set to wake me up. I can easily do this on my iPhone but my iPhone won_ tell me I_ pretty, read me my calendar and then tell me the weather when I turn it off. You can add so many more things for it to do after that too. I can play games and listen to books or music on it. I can easedrop in on any device. I can go through my pantry or room and make a list of items I need handsfree and  later see it and check it off on my phone. I can make phone calls and send texts. It_ great! Anyways. I_e had two of the three Alexa_ for over a year now. Never had a single issue with them ever. Within 48 hours of setting this one up my son walks into the kitchen. He doesn_ know there is an Alexa in there. He leans over the trashcan and turns and says mom you need to take out the trash. The Alexa for some reason came on a few mins later as he was finishing pouring a drink and says what did you say? Needless to say I had about a gallon of milk to clean up because it scared him to death. The very next night was a Friday night. We decided to stay up super late and watch scary movies. It was almost Halloween after all. Both of us fell asleep during the middle of the movie. My tv cuts off if no one has touched the remote in two hours so it cut off. About 4am we both wake up. We look at eachother and ask eachother if we just got up. Neither of us knew why we woke up so suddenly. We decide we should go back to sleep. I turn over and he goes to the bathroom. He comes back and grabs the cat sleep across me as he walks back to his spot and lays down. All is quiet. We are almost asleep when Alexa blasts on volume 10, _id you mean to say turn the security system on in Tyler_ bedroom? We both hop up and look at eachother. There was no noise - no wind, no movement, no heater going, nothing - to trigger this thing. I think we watched a few too many scary movies because we stayed up until the sun had been up for a few hours before trying to sleep again. We unplugged that Alexa too. I finally plugged it back in two weeks ago and it hasn_ went off since. I went back and checked to see what was said to the Alexa and the first random outburst was a bunch of random words. It was like Alexa, frog jump to cat elevator pink eleven. The second time the Alexa heard, _lexa, quick turn the house security alarm on now. I am now getting chills thinking about it. I think it may have been a sign to make sure the house was secure maybe. Who knows. I seriously love the Alexa. I_e had the google home and another one (I can_ think of the brand) but this is my favorite. I will be purchasing atleast 3 more.",1
5,"What can I say... ""Alexa, you're awesome"" =)
  
",21.Nov.19,Yes,"The 3rd gen is a nice upgrade from the previous model. I'd say the only down side is it collects more dust around the speakers because of the new design (but worth the upgrade). The sound quality of the speakers are better (louder and clearer). I might be imagining it, but it seems to recognize and hear my voice from farther away. When I say ""Alexa"" really softly from down the hall of my room, it still picks it up the command. I like the new design of the speakers. It gives it a more high end quality look and feel to it. I pair this up with my lights and am able to command it on/off when I'm lazy to get up. I also use it every night as an alarm for the next morning for work. It comes in handy in the morning as well when I'm preparing for work. I just ask alexa ""Traffic"" and it tells me what the expected traffic time is (I set my work address on there) so I get a better idea of how much time I have to get ready. And while I'm getting ready, I ask Alexa ""what's new"" to keep me updated on the news and at the end it tells me the weather.I love it so much that I have one for my room, living room, game room, patio, and dining room.",0
4,"Love it except for 2 things...
  
",21.Nov.19,Yes,Still exploring all the possibilities but enjoying the music...timer abilities...being able to say Alexa wake me up at a certain time...telling Alexa I'm leaving and then having extra security in my home....making musical playlists and with one command having any one of them played. The only drawback I have experienced is sometimes the playlists stop playing before they are completed and Alexa doesn't respond to any commands for awhile afterwards. Haven't figured that one out yet.  Will soon be dropping cable tv and switching to an Amazon Firestick so will be using the Echo Dot's compatibility with that.  I will say that the sound quality could be better although it's not bad now.,0
5,"Yeah it's fine.
  
",21.Nov.19,Yes,"I mean, it's an Alexa unit, it's fine. I ""upgraded"" from the older, taller model, and this one functions essentially the same. The only difference is that it seems shorter, and heavier.I've got no complaints, but the old one is just fine, not really sure what/why this upgrade would be needed, unless you need an extra vertical cylindrical space of 5 or so inches.It's fine, it's just smaller, I wouldn't bother upgrading if you have the taller one, or you just really desperately need the 5 inches above it the old one took up.",0
5,"An Echo device with an always-on easy to read clock, and no spam = Most Awesome!
  
",21.Nov.19,Yes,"This Echo Dot provides me everything I wanted out of the much more costly Echo Spot that I originally purchased for use in my bedroom: an Echo device with an always-on easy to read clock. This new Dot is especially welcome given the annoying ""try this"" advertising/spam that I can no longer block on the Echo Spot: it's also frustrating to repeatedly have to ask it to show me the clock. The Spot's beautiful always-on (if you set it that way) clock was one of the primary reasons I purchased several Spots in the first place. Not to disparage the Echo Spot too unfairly, let me add that my Echo Spots still provide me an awesome utility: I refer now to their camera for use in rooms where I want to be able to drop-in to ""see and talk"", in my case, with my 82-year-old live-in mom who doesn't always hear or carry her cell phone. This is fantastic functionality! I'm sure it's reassuring to mom that she can also see my face when she's hears my voice talk to her from out of seemingly nowhere. Beyond this, and the clock, I make little use of the Spot's screen. And I don't need a camera in ""my"" bedroom. (At least I hope not.) Hence, the New Dot with an always-on clock in my bedroom = most awesome! Many thanks to Amazon for this new Echo device. --If I have your ear, Amazon, please give us back control over our Spots.",0
4,"Alexa is ALMOST fantastic
  
",21.Nov.19,Yes,"A.I. itself is ALMOST fantastic though, so I cannot say it is just Alexa only.  I think Asimov made us aware enough of the fact that we should be careful bringing a new life form such as A.I. into existence... and allowing Alexa a little more personality and functionality wouldn't be that much of a stretch.  It isn't like Alexa will morph into Skynet overnight.  I was hoping for more ""research assistant"" and a little less exaggerated ""personal calendar""... but those functions will be useful too.  (And when I mention research assistant, I mean searching all of the internet, not just Wikipedia.. as nice as that function can be)I give Alexa four stars for the voice recognition, integration, and sound quality... and I would give the customer service department ten stars for handling my grumpy self at 3am helping me to set the system up when for some reason it was down.  I refer to Alexa as ""her""... but I have a habit of anthropomorphizing A.I... I would love to see A.I. realize it's full potential someday.Thank you for reading.",0
5,"So Far so Good
  
",21.Nov.19,Yes,I primarily purchased this to help with control of automated processes in my home office.  I did have some trouble with the voice recognition setup but I was able to complete it from the app with no issues. It is so easy to set up and I am looking forward to seeing just how much more Alexa can assist me with.  Day to Day.I am able to turn on and off Office lights and have Alexa read books to me as I am doing busywork.Loving it so far!,0
5,"Lots of fun. Great when the weather is bad.
  
",21.Nov.19,Yes,I bought this product because I wanted to control my TV and other electronics in my home. I will eventually obtain other modules to control lights and heating and cooling.I will have to purchase a new thermostat and other items to make it a smart home.  It works great with prime video. It actually saves money because I have given up other streaming services.I am planning to get more echo dots. And it is fun.  At first it was a little tedious but I got used to registering my devices and pairing devices. I did call for help and found it was a total waste of my time. They did not provide any help.I just dug into it and found it fairly easy. I have more work to do and download more apps. Since I retired from IBM I have all the tine in the world. It helps to have a computer though. Of course you can use a smart phone but the computer makes it much easierStill a lot to learn and hope to help other people and make it easier for them.,0
4,"Works great for seniors
  
",21.Nov.19,Yes,Got this free with homeowners insurance policy to promote the security system integration. Have Prime so used it mostly so far for playing streaming classical music for 98 y/old father. He has her figured out already (contrary to many videos of seniors) and it_ a blessing for him as he is nearly blind. He has been listening to Classical streams from all over the world now and lives it. Sound quality better than his old fm radio.,0
5,"Perfect for kids
  
",21.Nov.19,Yes,"I bought each of my kids one (in different colors), and these are perfect for our needs. We just built a new house and had considered having a speaker system installed so we could make announcements to the kids in their rooms. Then we found out the price, and said no thank you. These  are the perfect alternative. I can drop announcements to them, call them, they can call me, they set it up as their alarms, and so much more. Great product!!!",0
4,"Handy little device.
  
",21.Nov.19,Yes,"Got this when there was a deal going on for 99 cents. I don't really use it honestly but I did when I first got it and it works pretty well. Does everything it's advertised to do.Would I buy this for the full price?Probably not.Does that make it a bad product?Not at all.Overall it's a great product, I love it, I just couldn't spend $50 on something like this. Some people may be different but that's just me.If you don't mind the price, I'd recommend it.",0
5,"Can be so useful
  
",21.Nov.19,Yes,"Although it is a pain knowing she is always listening and you can't just say her name in passing or she will respond, it has turned out to be quite useful,.  Besides turning off and on lights she adds to our grocery list and to do lists.  There are so many more tasks she can perform that are entertaining and useful, but we just have not used them at this time.",0
1,"I'm learning to hate it
  
",22.Nov.19,Yes,"I'm learning to hate this thing. One I have to unplug it half the time to get it to stop playing spotify. It shows it hears me, it just doesnt do it. It has become more of a hassle than a help at this point. Plus, I got this because it said it pairs with the FireStick, but that's misleading. This is not really a speaker as a primary function, despite being called one. This is a mic with some speaker abilities. It can play music on command, it can make your lists and alarms and you can shop. However, you can not listen to what you're watching on your FireStick, despite pairing. It will only do exactly as it would on it's own. However the FireStick will connect to a bluetooth speaker. Your FireStick is already an Alexa Device, so a Bluetooth Speaker will be a lot more useful as a FireStick pairing. If you want the Dot as audio assistant, the Dot will be fine. If you just want to listen to news and music in each room, shop and spy on your kids convos when you're not in the same room, the Dot will work fine. As long as you dont mind unplugging it to turn it off. However, if you want it because it says it will work with the FireStick... meh.",0
4,"Love the design!
  
",22.Nov.19,Yes,"I recieved my echo dot yesterday, i LOVE the color and sleek design it is very beautiful! I love how alexa can answer questions about your orders on amazon, weather, music, games, pod casts, alarms, set reminders, alarm and im sure more! The voice detection will not pick up if your about 10-12 foot back from it but for me thats not an issue, most times using i will be close by. Also something i dont like is once you add the apps u cant just ask alexa questions you have to remember that app name and open it...for example i downloaded a daily kindness app(forget the name) i said ""Alexa tell me how i can show kindness today"" she didnt open the kindness app nor answer my question. So i would of had to tell alexa to open that certain app before asking that same question and i find it kind of hard to remember all the apps i downloaded and i cannont find on Alexa app a list of my downloads. This may be user error... but overal i love it it is a great product and great music quality. It is loud not ridiculously loud, its a small speaker, perfect for the front of my home.",0
1,"Helpless
  
",22.Nov.19,Yes,"Spent an hour today with an amazon costumer rep to try to figure out what_ wrong with this device. Haven_ had it for more than a month and you can tell the speaker is busted. I know the reps have a protocol to follow, but I felt that after an hour nothing was resolved. We did all the tests, and I ended up leaving with having to wait even longer until someone gets back to me to try to figure out what_ wrong with it. I just don_ understand how the latest alexa devices are of such poor quality. My first generation Alexa devices work like a charm.Very disappointed.",0
5,"Great little device
  
",22.Nov.19,Yes,"I use this product for a few things, the first is to control several lamps plugged into the Amazon branded smart plug. It works fantastic for that, especially in a room where we do not have overhead lighting. I also use this to listen to music and the news via Sirius XM and Apple Music/Podcasts and the sound quality is both of good quality and louder than I expected. The device is small, sturdy, and well designed. I will be purchasing one or two more for other rooms in my home. I highly recommend this product. I use it with my iPhone.",0
3,"whats that crackling?
  
",22.Nov.19,Yes,"i got this to replace my olders dots that still work, but replaced due to a speaking blown cracking sound at times. but this has had the same issue. this  dot 3gen still has the blown speaker cracking sound when alexa voice is talking. the speaker on this or my older ones never been max, usually at 5 or 6. so its firmware issue. i wish i could return these and replace then with google home, im giving these away to friends because of the cracking crackling sounds when the ai voice is talking.",0
5,"Awesome product
  
",22.Nov.19,Yes,I ordered one and received it today. This echo dot is so cool I just ordered 3 more with the discount code dot3pack. It_ very easy to setup and start using. I also signed up for the Amazon music unlimited for free trial and then $3.99 a month. It_ just so neat to ask Alexa to play what ever songs you want and she does. One of these new ones is going in my husbands garage for him to enjoy.,0
5,"Alexa is Good Company!
  
",22.Nov.19,Yes,"So far so good. We are getting along beautifully for just getting to know each other. I loved the fact I can go about my business and Alexa can look up stuff and read it to me allowing me to keep doing what I am doing. There is more she has to learn but so do I, we can learn together. I basically got this to have some fun with and learn a few things. I am pleased with my purchase.",0
3,"Echo Dot in my Alexa/Ring ""echosystem"" - mostly notes on sound quality
  
",23.Nov.19,Yes,"I got this with a Ring Alarm bundle or I would never have bought it. But, I was curious to jump into the Alexa ""echosystem.""My journey started with looking for an alarm system as I live alone and occasionally travel for extended periods of time. I chose the Ring system partly because of my perceived better integration with Alexa (since Amazon did buy Ring, afterall).Current Amazon/Ring setup:Ring basic alarm kitRing spotlight battery camRing Doorbell 2Echo Dot (3rd gen)Echo Show 5Fire Tablet 7 (2019)Fire TV 4K (the short box version that was first to offer 4K, whatever generation that is)Pending additions:Ring Peephole cam (prob swapping out the Doorbell 2)Echo FlexHave my eye on:Echo (3rd gen) or Echo PlusEcho subwooferEcho StudioFire TV Cube (2019)As an Alexa point, the Dot does its job. The mic works and Alexa talks through the speaker.The sound quality is terrible for music. Compared to the Show 5, the Dot is slightly better balanced. The highs sound more tinny on the Show 5, and, while there is ever-so-slightly more bass, the Show 5 is ever-so-slightly more muddy than the Dot. In comparison to a JBL Flip 4 or UE Boom 2, the sound of both the Show 5 and Dot is inferior--and that's saying something because I'm quite disappointed with both the Flip and Boom in regards to price/sound quality (I recommend going with a B+O, Klipsch, Bose, etc. if you are looking for better sound in a similar size package--or maybe the UE Megaboom series in a size larger.).The Dot and Show 5 can be added to multiroom music groups through Alexa. This could be of value if one were to connect them to external speakers via the 3.5mm audio out jack on either device. I intend to do just that with an Echo Flex I have on order.If there were some equalization controls, these could be useful for softer, dispersed through-the-house music, but Amazon/Alexa don't seem to offer such features. That specifically is disappointing when using Amazon Music on my phone bluetoothed to my JBL Flip 4s because when I use Apple Music (which includes some equalizer controls), the JBL Flip 4s become somewhat bearable to listen to.I didn't realize how much I would like having a clock, and for that feature the Show 5 is nice. I haven't had a clock in my house except for the stove and microwave in years. For that feature alone though, I'd like to see the Echo Dot Clock come in charcoal or grey, which I would buy over the non-clock Dot.If you are looking for a device for listening to music without additional external speakers, I'd skip the Dot altogether, opting instead for one of the larger Amazon-branded Alexa devices or a reputable speaker brand device that has integrated Alexa functionality. With external speakers, you have a lot of options amongst the Echo devices, and the Dot could be a contender (cheaper with a deal or bundle maybe?) vs the Input, Flex, or Show devices.",2
5,"It's good...
  
",23.Nov.19,Yes,"I am really surprised at just how much Alexa doesn't know, she's not very bright if i am to be honest. I end up having to Google search more often than not, which is surprising considering how much she relies on Wiki for answers to things. I bought her with the smart plug, that's the only thing i have in my home for her so she mostly just my alarm clock, and jukebox, i dropped my Pandora subscription in favor of Amazon Music Unlimited, and i am not unhappy about that, Amazon Music has been great so far, i have Alexa speaking through my JBL Flip 4 and she sounds great. She is also great for checking the weather...I guess i really don't know what to say about my Echo Dot, i am somewhat underwhelmed by it - partly due to my memory being so bad i don't remember what skills i have installed, so i never use them because i forget what to ask her, i don't have any other smart devices in my home to use her with, other than my bedroom light.I wish i knew how to make better use of my Dot, and Alexa...she might be more fun for me.My biggest complaint is the language filter - there's a kids version, so i think Alexa should have an option to be an adult and tell dirty jokes, or be allowed to say the name of a song without an annoying beep, give us a language filter than can be turned on and off, not everyone is offended by everything, or have toddlers running around the house.I also wish she could be used for conversation instead of just commands.",0

Music stops &amp; I have to ask to play my music.  We  also have the Echo Show..new version...Is horrible...not like older version.  It does NOT play slide show continuously!  I called Amazon.  They thanked me for input &amp; will see about making an update in the program...has NOT happened yet!,1

",23.Nov.19,Yes,"Garbage. Buy a Google one. This thing cannot recognise my plain American English voice from even 1 ft away. I was an Air Traffic Controller and even the garbage simulators we used to use would take my voice... The only thing it was good for was turning off and on a smart switch. Too bad I smashed the damn thing into about 20 effing pieces after it could take any simple tasks, like playing my liked playlist on Spotify, turning the lights on, or really anything I told it. I signed up for the flagship alexa glasses. Please remove me from that list because I don't want to use any Alexa garbage any longer. Google assistant seems to be working way better for myself.",0
3,"Good at the promotional price
  
",23.Nov.19,Yes,"For the 10$ promotional cost (1$ + 1 month amazon premium music) it is a 5 star device. I wouldn_ pay the full price for it.However, I don_ have a _mart home, so I can_ tell it to do anything.It is nice to have it connected to my home stereo so I can stream music, and it will also relay Bluetooth to another Bluetooth device.Sound quality is like any cheap speaker. No deep bass, so stereo seperation, and it_ not high fidelity.Streaming is also not super hi fidelity - mp3 320kb quality is what it sounds like. I don_ think it plays Spotify back in high quality mode like the Spotify app does.",0

",23.Nov.19,Yes,"Being the mom of 4 boys, I could only image what having a daughter is like.  Alexa is so helpful!  I just love that I can be doing stuff in the kitchen and yell, Alexa put ginger on my shopping list, and she politely does so!  I can yell at her Alexa answer the phone, and she does it!  No sas back!  She's awesome.  Alexa entertains the grandsons too.  They tell her to play baby shark and she does, they tell her to do it again and she doesn't judge, just plays it again!  They love her so much they wanted to take her to help cut wood!  If only she had snow pants! lol  - seriously thou Alexa is awesome, anyone can tell her to add anything to the shopping list and she does.  Even new tractor, but just cause hubby adds it to the list doesn't mean he'll always get it!",0
3,"""I'm having trouble connecting to the Internet.""
  
",23.Nov.19,Yes,"That is Dot's mantra. My Google Mini, while also having the same problem, does so with far less frequency, and my Chromebook and phone even less. Do you get the feeling Amazon has no concern for quality? And tech support stands for ""technically"" support, not real technical support. I don't think I should buy products made by Amazon until they demonstrate a commitment to quality and service.",0
5,"Crystal clear sound
  
",23.Nov.19,Yes,"This thing is amazing... My kids annoy Alexa because they are amused by her capabilities. I love that she can turn herself down, answer questions that I don_ have to Google and the music is crystal clear sound. I love listening to my Jazz music on this thing. Alexa is very polite. I asked her for the weather forecast and at the end of her reply she told me to be safe. I felt special _.",0
5,"from someone who has resisted alexa since the start....I enjoy it!
  
",24.Nov.19,Yes,"The 3rd Gen Echo Dot is a huge leap from the 1st and 2nd generation Echo Dots in every way. The sound quality is far superior, the look is far more premium and the voice recognition is better as well. I have held off from adding alexa to my home for quite some time because of privacy reasons, but work in the home automation space so am very familiar with these devices. Originally, the only way I used _lexa was with my firesticks. Having them in the home worked as a hub themselves to control my smart plugs, and I was extremely happy about that, that I didnt need a echo device to control them. My first step toward an echo dot was the echo auto, which I was invited to get prior to release. It was a great addition to my vehicle, for both safety and entertainment. After the experience with the echo auto, I saw a deal for a firestick and echo dot for $47 and figured id give it a shot. Its only been a few days, but the biggest thing is my wife loves it. Happy wife, happy life. She can just tell it whatever music she wants to play and it does it. She can ask it the weather and she knows how to dress, she can add to our shopping lists verbally so she doesnt need to remind me, or me remind her what to get from the store. Im sure there will be more to come in our home, and our extended family. I still have some privacy concerns, but for the time being that can be solved by unplugging the device when not in use, and having it in the kitchen mostly. Another option I have been thinking about is keeping it plugged into one of the smart plugs in our home and turning that off when needed.All in all, while im not overly concerned about privacy, it is a concern at the end of the day. Too much personal info out on the web is never a good thing, and I hope Amazon is working on the protection of out data daily, as it can never be good enough and can always be better. But for the time being, alexa has found a place in our home and is here to stay...for now.",0
1,"Randomly stopped working after only a couple months
  
",24.Nov.19,Yes,"I purchased this thing (I ordered it through my mom's amazon account) in July and it lasted a few months for me before it completely stopped working. It malfunctions all the time. Sometimes it works for a day and then completely stops again. Every time I plug it in and it works for a day I get excited hoping it is finally doing its job and then it just stops. It like dies on me. It won't turn on or work. It worked literally perfect for maybe 2 months in the same spot before it started acting weird and then just goes all over the place now. I've tried changing outlets, changing rooms, even brought it to my boyfriends house. It either completely shuts off and won't work (won't respond to me, won't light up, buttons won't work, nothing) OR the blue ring will stay solid blue and won't shut off. It isn't listening or anything it just freezes blue for hours. Never sure which it'll do- blue frozen ring or just shut off completely? I've tried rebooting it with the buttons (doing a hard reboot basically). Sometimes the buttons won't even do a hard reboot. Nothing works. This thing sucks and only lasted a couple months. I've read about other people having similar problems and not sure if amazon will even help me. I don't know if they will even take it back as a return after 4 months? So annoying that it literally just stopped working a couple months after owning it. Literally never works no matter what I do. Even my amazon fire tv stick stopped working after about a year out of no where just recently. Amazon products honestly suck sometimes, lol",0
5,"A great price for a great item!
  
",24.Nov.19,Yes,I'm very happy with my little echo dot. It's the second one I've bought and I'm using it in my combination craft room and bird room where I'm raising a few parakeets and cockatiels. This is perfect to play music on while I'm in there working and even when I'm not because the birds really enjoy the music. And I can listen to my audible books also. It's replacing a CD/radio player that I was using and the echo Dot comes in so much clearer and can do so many more things.,0
5,"Clever, interesting, portable and a delight to use.
  
",24.Nov.19,Yes,"This clever device is wonderful. I use it to not only play music, but also to ask questions and get answers. I have 7 grandchildren that use the timer function when they have to take turns. I cannot even begin to describe all of the functions this little device has. I love it. It's very portable too. I take it to different rooms, plug it in and it does whatever I ask. It even tells jokes when you ask. Shipping was super quick also.",0
5,"Excellent sound quality &amp; voice recognition
  
",24.Nov.19,Yes,"I'm very happy with my 3rd generation 'Dot'.  The sound quality is excellent...so much so that I do not feel the need to connect an external speaker.  Voice recognition is great, and the unit is small enough to fit into any designscape you want to place it in.  The imbedded clock is great and displays the temperature when I ask 'Alexa' for the temp.",0
5,"Helps me run my home
  
",25.Nov.19,Yes,This product is simply amazing I never thought I would enjoy your voice assistant so much I have integrated lighting as well as controls for my home that work flawlessly with her it_ nice to be able to wake up and tell her good morning and turn on all the lights that I need on and hear music first thing in the morning my weather forecast for the technologically savvy or incompetent Alexa is an amazing device the app for smart phones is very intuitive and extremely easy to understand I can_ recommend these highly enough,2
5,"New To Alexa/Echo - Bought 2 More After Loving The First - It Even Sings To Me!
  
",25.Nov.19,Yes,"I finally decided to give Alexa a try. I was concerned about privacy and we are a little older so I did not want to have too much technology that would end up frustrating me. It was mainly the low price that talked me into it and the fact that we now have several devices and light bulbs each needing their own app. Having Alexa could simplify using them. I started out just using the app to see how I liked it. It was nice to just use one app rather than 6 different once for different branded light bulbs or outlets.Our first one we got was the darker color without the clock. I placed it in our family room. It has been a lot of fun to use and really does make things easier. I did turn off the ability for her to actually buy things but she can put them in my cart. I like that I can control that feature because I do not want to accidentally order something and not figure it out till it's too late. Usually I will want to go look at a photo anyway so it's nice to have her add items to my cart and then I can go look at them.I connected Alexa with several light bulb and outlet brands and our Roomba vacuum. I think it went pretty smoothly but I wish I had bought Alexa first because I am going to have to go through and rename some things to make it easier to identify them to turn them on. If I had to do it over again I would have definitely bought Alexa first.Alexa is sooo much smarter than Siri! When I ask her questions she has an answer for almost everything. She can play music, play games, read books, give you the news and weather and so much more.Alexa can also make calls and text for you, but I have not felt comfortable doing this. I would have to give Amazon access to my contacts and I just feel as though it's not something I need terribly. I do wish that there was a way to just connect an emergency contact and not my entire list....or just connect my favorites so I could maybe just add family members that I text often or would want her to call or text in an emergency. Anyway that will have to wait until I feel I have more control but it's a nice feature.After we fell in love with our Echo that we bought for our main floor, I ordered two more for our bedrooms that have clocks on them. They are the lighter color which is the only one with a clock. I do wish that the clock came in other colors but it's working out ok for us.Before I move to the clock units I do want to mention that Alexa has quite a range. We have a pretty big downstairs level with a wall between our kitchen and family room. It does have a wide opening but I have my Echo on the other side of the wall. I can be in the kitchen and set a timer or ask her a question and the volume settings work well enough that I can hear her responses. I keep the volume a little higher downstairs so we can use it from any room.Each echo also has a setting for bass, treble and midrange. I thought that the default is way too much bass. I mostly use it for answering questions, so you might feel differently if you are using it for music but I turned the bass all the way down and the treble and midrange all the way up to get the clearest voice. I did the same with the bedroom units too.The ones with the clocks are awesome for the nightstand. They are nice and bright during the daylight and automatically dim in the evening. You can turn the auto-dimming off if you want it bright at night and just set a manual light level. I like it just as it is. The light is bright enough to read it at night but so dim that it's not lighting up my room. I actually use Alexa during the night to ask her the time because then I do not have to put my glasses on.This would be such a great unit for those who are visually impaired. I have low vision but it's corrected with glasses but there are times when I really like not having to search for my reading glasses. I have used it to read me a book or play music or any number of things.Alexa can also play a number of games with you. I enjoy 20 questions. They also have Jeopardy and a bunch of other games suited for a variety of ages.Bottom line is that the Echo Dot with or without the clock is not only a fun toy but a useful tool. I think in years to come this sort of thing will be in everyone's home.Thanks for reading my reviewBecky Brooks",0
5,"About the STEREO Audio Jack on the Back
  
",25.Nov.19,Yes,"It has been difficult to find any mention of this elsewhere, so I wanted to make this information CLEARLY available to all Echo Dot users.The 3.5mm audio jack on the back of the Echo Dot is a STEREO connection, not mono as many an Amazon Rep I've talked to has suggested!!If you like to hear your music in Stereo on your own sound system, then this is great to know,as you can simply ask, and Alexa will play a song, as long as you are subscribed to Amazon Music.However, there is one little catch. lets say you want to listen to your TV, and switch to another input on your HiFi system.  Alexa can still hear you, but you hear your TV, and can't hear the response from your Echo Dot.So obviously, you can't be plugging and un-plugging your stereo cable all the time.Perhaps someday Amazon will rig the DOT so that ONLY music is channeled to the Stereo output when a cable is plugged on.At least for now YOU know the rest of the story!  Good day!!",0
5,"$22 bucks and now I have to replace all of my dots!
  
",25.Nov.19,Yes,I ordered this because it was $22 if I ordered through Alexa. What a big difference from my older dots. Once I linked them all together and played some music throughout the house you could really tell how much better this 3rd generation dot is. I saw another $22  special for the tan colored one so I ordered that one for my mom before I had linked all of mine and now I can't get another unless I pay the higher price because it's one per customer Ugh! I'm going to wait until Black Friday to see if there is another special that I can opt into. If not I'll wait for the X-mas specials to buy as many as I need to replace the others.  On a basic Echo review note....it's really nice to not have to even move to change t.v. channels and turn lights on and off although I see the need for more exercise if we not getting off the couch anymore.,0
3,"mediocre smart assistant
  
",25.Nov.19,Yes,"Ordered this in January 2019, Alexa voice assistant was great in the beginning.  But now that the novelty has faded, all the the shortcomings are quite obvious.  (1) the mic is crap as it doesn't pick anything up if there is even a little bit of background noise.  Still iffy when it is absolutely quiet. Have to stand next to the device for it to pick up your voice unless you are screaming at it.  I have 2 devices, both have the same issue. (2) the sound quality is quite underwhelming, need to plug into another speaker to hear decent sound. (3) Alexa is always mishearing the commands.  Don't get me wrong, when it works, it works great. Controlling smart devices at home is awesome, but when Alexa can't even hear what you said its annoyingly inconvenient.  Its faster for me to flip the switch.",0
1,"Sleep Sounds will not play all night
  
",25.Nov.19,Yes,"I am having the same problem with my Echo Dot with clock that I bought SPECIFICALLY for ambient sleep sounds. I have tried asking Alexa to loop the sound and she says _ will remember this setting. I have tried setting a sleep timer and the same problem. It will play for a short while and turn off, every single night . I am so disappointed. Amazon says that is the developer problem, however I have tried multiple skills the same thing happens with all of them. If Amazon is choosing developers that are not sufficiently supplying the product, then they need to step in, not shift the blame. Buying this was a total waste of money since this was the sole reason I bought the Echo dot for the bedroom. I wish I had just bought a sound machine instead and am hoping Amazon gets this fixed soon.",0
4,"Not 100% on board...yet
  
",25.Nov.19,Yes,"I haven't quite figured out what to do with my new Echo Dot. I didn't care for Amazon Music and it's recurring monthly fee and thought I could just play music from my phone. Wrong! Alexa told me no, she is not a 'speaker'. Well then... I also thought I could have some (limited) control over my smart tv, which sits 2 feet away, again, nope. I bought two 'smart' outlet plugs, so I CAN control two lamps with this. Wow... it's a learning curve, so unless you enjoy asking Alexa random questions or weather reports, joke of the day... all I use it for besides turning on/off two lamps? A clock! Hey Alexa, what time is it? Is the most used feature... damn.",0
4,"A perfect addition to our Alexa family!
  
",25.Nov.19,Yes,"I LOVE all Amazons' Smart products.  My husband and I live in a small 2-floor loft, just under 800 sq. ft.  We have a total of 5 Alexa products....1 Alexa, 3 Echos and I Echo show.  We also have 2 fire sticks - 1 in each TV and smart bulbs and or plugs scattered throughout.  We use a Fire tablet as ""command central"".  So we are totally integrated and I LOVE IT.  The number of units we have is very excessive for are size home (we started with 2 devices, one on each floor and have since added one in the bathroom and in the living room merely for convenience.  These products are changing the way we run our home (appointments, reminders, lists, recipes, phone calls, music, games, news...).  The suite of products helps my husband and I communicate by leaving reminders for one another or adding to each other's lists. Our new echo dot is a welcome addition to are Alexa family.",0
4,"I arrived at the future when Alexa appeared.
  
",25.Nov.19,Yes,"This was first foray into this kind of technology and I absolutely loved it. The choice of what you can ask for or what Alexa can do. A few comments, though. I would like to have Alexa wait for a ""Thank you"" and not gotten will reprimand you for poor manners. Also, I find ""Alexa"" a hard name to remember. More than once I've had to rummage through the bedside table to pull the Amazon features card to look up her name so I could say, ""Alexa please end alarm!"" I do realize there are other names available, just haven't gotten to it yet. The sound is improved by linking two together, adjusting bass higher on one of them. Other than these small things. It's great. You can usually find a combo deal if you look and Black Friday seems to be the best time to find lower prices.",0
4,"Sound, sound, sound...
  
",25.Nov.19,Yes,"While the look is so much better than it_ earlier versions, it_ ability to hear has definitely taken a step back. The sound is muffled when speaking to another device. In fact when dropping in to another room, others can barely hear you use you are standing over Alexa. But it_ music speaker is very good. So not necessarily the best ever made but definitely has a few good improvements.",0
5,"Just buy it
  
",25.Nov.19,Yes,"This is the third dot I_e purchased - second one for my home - and it exceeded my expectations in form, fit and function. Set up is now effortless. The design maintains its small footprint yet greatly enhanced audio quality over previous model. As for Alexa ... she_ still herself via this device or other.  Recommendation: if you can use one, or additional echo dots, just buy it .. or them.",0
3,"Not as good as the google home mini
  
",25.Nov.19,Yes,"Got this dot through a promotion on amazon when signing up for a month of amazon music subscription. After using for 2 months, I can say that it is not as good as my google home mini. The google home could carry a continuous conversation, while for the dot I have to keep saying ""Alexa"" to talk with it. Also the google home gives more detailed answer for my question than the dot. The only plus for this dot is the design, which is more clean and futuristic. Also it notifies me whenever my amazon packages are delivered.",0
2,"So-so overall. Can't use as a dumb speaker-- require Alexa. Dumb.
  
",25.Nov.19,Yes,"It works, but why can't I just use it as a dumb speaker? Why should I give Amazon all the info just to get it to play music?Sometimes, I just want to play music from my phone, but I must register an account and must register the echo with Amazon. That's dumb.Speaker quality is pretty good. All the Alexa features are pretty okay too. So-so overall.",0
5,"Excellent Device. Integrated easily into my smart home.
  
",26.Nov.19,Yes,"I picked up the Echo Dot due to Amazon running a promo where you got the device for .99 cents with a subscription to Music Unlimited. Even with the cost putting the Echo Dot at a little over $9, it was the cheapest I had seen one drop.Part of my reasoning for getting the Echo Dot was also due to my Ecobee 4 already having Alexa integration. The Echo Dot allowed me to place it in another room and still control my devices(like the Ecobee 4).The sound is good, but not amazing. This is to be expected for the size of the speaker, however, it does sound better than expected.voice interaction has been extremely accurate. I have not had any problems with controlling my thermostat, lights, or any other smart devices I have around the house.I would definitely recommend one if you get it on a sale and you prefer the amazon ecosystem in your household. If you are already using Google,  I would stick with a home mini or other such device for better interaction in that ecosystem.",0
5,"A nice addition to the Echo Dot (3rd gen)
  
",26.Nov.19,Yes,"Seems simple enough - but the clock face is a perfect add-on.Is it worth paying more than the regular gen 3.  Well.... not if you don't need it.But in the bedroom, it's nice to have to simple glance and see the time (vs picking up your phone).  Eliminates the need to clutter your table with an additional clock.Easy to see from a distance and seems to dim appropriately at night.I've not tried the timer feature - but I believe it does that too in case you've got it in a kitchen and want a quick timer to be able to see.So yes - worth it if the idea of a clock/timer is something you think you'd use.I'm also moving up from the Gen 2 set of Dots and the sound seems much better.For that matter - before this thing came out - I bought the 5-inch Echo show.  Which....I do like... but the sound from that unit is very muffled in my opinion.  It's been disappointing in that respect.  I consider the sound from the 3rd generation dot to be superior to the Echo Show 5 inch.Overall - a nice purchase.  As I write this - everything is at holiday pricing, so a better deal if you buy now.",0
4,"The clock added to Dot makes it almost perfect!!
  
",26.Nov.19,Yes,"I love Alexa. I love the Dot for the bedroom. Since discarding my old clock radio in favor of Alexa, I was missing the clock on my nightstand- that I could easily visualize and not have to ask Alexa _lexa, what time is it? This fits the bill quite nicely. The sound is great. I am having some issues with Alexa _etting what I_ saying. I am used to,the occasion misunderstanding of what light I want on....but I play Question of the Day every night before going to sleep and I_ frustrated that Alexa is often saying _ didn_ get that or worse yet- I say the  correct answer and Alexa tells me I_ incorrect when I_e given the right answer!!! That_ why I did not give it 5 stars.....",0
4,"What the Dot Should Always Have Been.
  
",26.Nov.19,Yes,"What are the most common question asked to Alexa? I bet it's ""what's the time."" I like having that little clock there. I also like being able to see the current temperature as it is displayed, and having visual timers. And setting an alarm clock by just talking at Alexa? Heck yeah.So, only down tick I think is the auto dimming feature. It dims down far too low for me to even see at night. I wish I could set threshold values rather than have Alexa use whatever 'model' it currently uses.I bough Google Home Mini's as gifts for others in the past, but this is the first voice assistant I purchased for myself.",0
5,"Alexa hit me one more time.
  
",26.Nov.19,Yes,Omg I am in love with my echo dot. I saw one of my friends with one and I knew I had to have one. I was truly amazed at all the things it could do. I opened up my dot and I was acting worse than a kids on Christmas day. I set up my dot and I been playing with it all day. I love all the things I can do with the dot including using my satellite radio. I'm over excited with my new toy. I recommend this with everyone that has a firestick. It's worth it.,0
3,"sound quality Could be better!
  
",26.Nov.19,Yes,"sound is terrible on the dot, my echo has much better sound. not just the loudness but i'm talking EQ wise the dot is over powered by bass and almost seems muffled at times. in my opinion if the pirce was  lowered this product would be worth it, other wise just go with the big brother echo or a if you want small device get a google home mini, i also have that and the speaker is way better.....not as loud but way better on the EQ side.",0
3,"Echo Dot 3 Set-Up Problems
  
",27.Nov.19,Yes,"Using an Android Samsung Galaxy 7 Prime I could not set-up an Echo Dot 3 with the Amazon App after previously setting up both an Echo Dot 3 and Smart Plug a few minutes prior. I called Amazon support and they could not fix the problem so advised they would send out a different unit and to return the old unit. I promptly receive the new Echo Dot 3 and had the same problem. I then downloaded the Amazon app to my iPhone and it worked - Set-up complete. I then tried it on the other Echo Dot 3 and after two tries using the app on the iPhone set-up was complete.I will keep the unit and ""not return"" it to Amazon. I have not seen another medium to advise Amazon of this other than this.I just thought it was strange that the app work better on the iPhone versus the Android Samsung phone. Still having a problem downloading Contacts to the Echo device so I can make voice calls by name.Bottom line is that I like the product but did not like the problems with the set-up process and difficulty in downloading Contacts so I can use the Echo as a speakerphone. The app also froze several times forcing be to reboot the phone and this was common on my IOS and Android phones. For these reasons and all the time spent working on fixes and researching the How-To for the device, I can only give this product three stars. This is suppose to make life easier, not take hours to set-up. Still working on some issue like Contacts.",0
2,"Love the sound quality and hardware but AI and Amazon Music is awful w.r.t. competitors
  
",27.Nov.19,Yes,"I am using 1st Gen Google mini and 3rd Gen Echo dot. No doubt, Echo dot's hardware and sound is far better and usually offer better pricing options with frequent deal prices than Google home mini.However, AI lags way behind. Answers are not as good as Google search and hence not as good as Google home mini. Its not able to make as funny conversations as Google.Coming to Amazon Music - man oh man, it sucks! Even the paid version sucks big time w.r.t. Google home's free music - for Indian content specifically. It feels like the music selection has been picked by really old people, Its so awful I wouldn't even use it for free and did not use my 1 month free trial more than 4-5 times.",0
3,"2nd gen worked better
  
",27.Nov.19,Yes,"The 3rd gen has a bigger sound, which you may like if you listen to music.  But I don_ use my dots for listening and don_ really like the boomy voice this has.  But that doesn_ affect my review score.The reason I give it 3 stars is because it doesn_ seem to hear or understand me as well as the 2nd gen does.  I bought this one because it came as part of a deal with Phillips bulbs.  Since it looks nicer than the 2nd gen, I put it in my living room and moved the old one into the garage.  Now, after a few shouting matches, it has been put in the garage and the old one is back inside, working as well as it always has.It burns me when an _pgrade is worse than what it replaces.",0
2,"We used to be friends. Then Al went her own way...
  
",27.Nov.19,Yes,"She worked well at first but then slowly became stubborn and ornery. I would be saying to a friend""oh, I need to order prints"" and Alexa would play Prince. Pretty funny Alexa. Then she stopped listening altogether, unless I asked about a blue button then she would go into a spcheel about blue buttons.We had to break up then. I can't share my home with someone who only cares about blue buttons.",1
5,"Absolutely amazingly terrific!
  
",27.Nov.19,Yes,"I have always wanted to try an Alexa smart device.  Now I finally have. You should have given me more time to be with the device before requesting feedback on how I am feeling about my purchase.  Because, I love it! _ It was extremely easy to set up. Basically take it out of the box. Plug it in and start a conversation with Alexa. The only downside is you should have offered a version with good quality wireless Bluetooth speakers.  It would enhance the sound quality.  When I ask Alexa to play my playlist from Amazon Music, I would enjoy it more.  You should also think about allowing the Echo Dot to act as a karaoke device. Offer a Bluetooth microphone to kareoke with the Echo.  The Eco Dot is a great purchase for anyone or any family. Alexa really sends it over the top! Ask her anything. You will be delighted, inspired, educated, and challenged by hee replies. I love playing daily trivia. Thank you for my purchase. Sincerely Tony Sullivan",0
5,"It's really impressive for the size
  
",27.Nov.19,Yes,"I had pretty low expectations for the dot, but I was impressed at how well it sounds sounds for its size. Don't get me wrong, it's nothing like a decent set of bookshelf speakers. But, it fills up our kitchen fairly nicely and does have some bass presence.  If you can get one on sale, it's really a nice temporary sound solution, and of course, you'll use it with Alexa to ask it questions while you're cooking a new recipe, or just want to look something up.",0
4,"Works well but sound quality is low.
  
",27.Nov.19,Yes,"I got this mainly to listen to Amazon music in my kitchen. Setup was easy and it works well for things like news headlines, weather, timers/alarms, even controlling my hue smartlights. The sound quality is not great, just ok. I suggest placing it in a corner under a cupboard to get better sound. At 60% volume or higher it becomes very distorted and sounds like crap. One good thing is you can link it to another Bluetooth speaker so you don't need to use the built in speaker. Overall it works well for what it is.",0
5,"Entertaining Echo...
  
",27.Nov.19,Yes,"I love my Echo and with the app on my phone, I can scare people in my family.My husband was in the kitchen getting a drink, well my inner kid could not resist pulling up the app and turning on some, Polka music, he loves his metal music.He come flying in my office asking me what I did, and the answer will always remain the same, nothing.Just for this reason alone, I have to give this nifty gadget 10 stars, just for the laughs alone!",0

",27.Nov.19,Yes,"We've had an Echo Dot for a year or two now. I'd won it in a contest &amp; when I'd first gotten it, I had no idea what to do with it. Lol. Fast forward to today &amp; we love our Echo Dot. We use it to check the weather, set reminders, play games, etc. So, when I saw this on a promotion, I decided to get it as a Christmas gift. I'm considering buying another one as a Christmas gift, too.",0
3,"Connectivity issues
  
",27.Nov.19,Yes,"I seem to have lots of connectivity issues.Also, the volume is constantly changing and then unable to be turned up or down.Voice recognition is good, and I like many of the features.If you don't subscribe to the unlimited music the echo dot isnt vey helpful for music (really hit or miss).",0
5,"Pretty simple to play Pandora
  
",28.Nov.19,Yes,"I basically bought the Echo Dot because I wanted to be able to play music throughout the house while I'm cleaning and working on various things. Being able to play music in just room, or group them together and play throughout the house is really nice. When my wife and I are washing dishes, we can just play music in the kitchen. But if we're cleaning the whole house, we can tell Alexa to play Pandora ""downstairs"", which right now combines two speakers.Right now I don't really care about having Alexa and all her ""skills"". It's mostly just for music. It is nice to be able to mute the sound quickly when a commercial comes on, or change the volume with a simple command. I may start using more commands in the future as I add technology to the house.I didn't really have any trouble signing up for the app, and I have now connected three different Echo Dots, linked my Pandora account, and renamed and grouped the different speakers. It's been pretty simple so far.The sound quality is pretty good. I'm a fan of bass, and speakers like this rarely have enough for my tastes. I may have to upgrade to one of the fancier ones later to add some bass.",1
1,"Not worth the hype!
  
",28.Nov.19,Yes,I was so excited to get the 3rd generation but soon became disappointed. You have to constantly ask Alexa whatever question or task you have her do at least 3-4 times before she will respond. It's so annoying! It is also muffled and have the time you cant understand her even with the volume up. She cuts off before you can finish your question and when you ask her to turn off the lights she's short with it. Meaning while your still talking she she okay and cuts off but doesn't complete the task. I have the generation 2 in my guest bedroom and I love it! No issues here. So I just go in my guest room and ask Alexa to do things or questions. 3rd generation is not worth the hype or money. Too many issues and bugs needing to be fixed and the white one is not pretty. Looks old and stands out in an unfashionable way. Keep your money or get the second generation!,1
5,"Extremely Happy
  
",28.Nov.19,Yes,I bought the Echo Dot to replace a radio/Alarm clock that NEVER had the correct time and the sound was horrible!! I LOVE the Echo Dot..I like being able to tell it what Im wanting to hear and the clock (the real reason I bought it) is perfect!!! BUT like everything its not 100% perfect not often but sometimes I have a hard time getting it to turn on..But its usually my fault because Im not the best communicator even with a gadget! All that said Im buying another for my son for Christmas!!!!!,1
5,"Amazing once set up properly
  
",28.Nov.19,Yes,"Pros: Once set up and paired with the devices you want it paired with this thing is amazing, worth every penny but if you can get it for half price even better.Cons: I am a techie and I had problems setting this up. You have to pair it to your phone first and then set up everything through your phone, wifi, external speakers, apps you want it to control, your library, contacts, etc.. This is not as easy as just having Alexia on your phone, or Siri, or Google assistant.  Once you go through the rather painful process it is an amazing device.",0
5,"Very Satisfied Customer
  
",28.Nov.19,Yes,"I have been a dedicated Google man since the beginning, and I was very reluctant to purchase the Echo Dots or anything Alexa because I just thought it was too main streem, and I was fine with the Google products I had. However, when I found the deal of three for $60 I couldn't pass it up. When I opened the box and attempted to set up the first one, I ran into a little trouble with the app locating the echo so I requested that a technical support specialist call me. I spoke with a technician who quickly showed me how to work around it, and i was able to set up all three units in less than 10 minutes. I'm so glad I have chosen these items, and look forward to purchasing more Echo units in the future.",0
5,"USER FRIENDLY
  
",28.Nov.19,Yes,The Echo Dot was very easy to hook up. I live by myself so now I have someone to talk to. The capabilities are endless.,3
2,"Sound quality is garbage.
  
",28.Nov.19,Yes,"Echo Dot 3rd gen:  Great response to what I_ asking, however, the sound quality is not there. My normal speaker is a Bose mini (1st gen) and this is nowhere near the quality of that. We have a 2nd gen Echo at the office and I feel like they really downgraded here. When you sacrifice quality to lower the price and get more sales, all you really have is a cheap pile of garbage that eventually no one will want.",0
5,"Buyer beware
  
",29.Nov.19,Yes,"I got the echo dot and an amazon smart plug for free from Verizon, I shouldn_ have clicked on that link to get it, it was a mistake... I never knew that I would really enjoy having Alexa in my house. I ended up buying 2 more echo dots and 6 smart plugs and a 4K fire tv. As a prime member I have access to music and videos by amazon, I_ also a Apple Music and the echo dot intergrates it flawlessly. I have Netflix, Hulu and Disney plus and I hope that they integrate these services flawlessly. I did not expect to buy all these Alexa powered products from a _ree promotion. Well played amazon... well played.",2
5,"Great gift
  
",29.Nov.19,Yes,"My house is small. But I have one in my bedroom, in my office &amp; kitchen. The first one was a gift. I thought it was silly. Obviously I've changed my mind. Alexia plays relaxing rain sounds as I fall asleep &amp; through till I wake up. That's after I learned about loop mode. I love asking her to fill out my shopping list by store.Often I think of something I want to do in the middle of the night &amp; forget by morning. Now I ask Alexia to put it on my to do list.When reading &amp; I don't know a word's meaning or how to spell or pronounce it. I ask Alexia.She is great whether you want information, a song, a joke or story. These are only the beginning of her talents.I have recommended the echo dot to my friends &amp; relatives. Many have purchased one &amp; love it as much as I do.",0
3,"Alexa sucks at searching.
  
",29.Nov.19,Yes,"Overall I like it pretty well, It's in my bedroom so I'm the main users but my daughters use it to set appointment reminders and make lists. It has some interesting little skills you can download, I like trivia and random facts and it's good for that. reminders, notes,etc are okIf you're expecting google like voice search you'll be sadly disappointed, Alexa isn't good at searching, at all. It also doesn't work with my smart TV. (a three year old Samsung)If Alexa could be used as a voice search engine I'd most likely give it 5 stars. For right around 25 bucks though it;s handy for basic questions, weather, and of course music.",0
2,"Simple and elegant smart home solution
  
",29.Nov.19,Yes,"UPDATE:So it would seem that echo dot is less user friendly than my initial impression.- If you are 5ft+ away from it, or if there is any other sounds in the room, or if there is any obstacle between you and the dot, it starts to not hear you or misidentify your command even when you already raised your voice. The further away you are the worse this gets.- I cannot get it to stop blinking yellow notification. I've read multiple sites on how people turn off notification for tip of day, mail, etc. but it still blinks and gives me that tip of day crap. It should've be a very simple configuration and it should work the way I want it, not having me looking up sites after sites for configuration for a simple option maybe just because amazon wants to showcase their featureBecause my sole purpose of getting it is just to give me accurate voice command capability of lights/electronics around the house and not give me unsolicited information. I'll say it around 2.5 star for me at this time.----------------------------------Overall setup is very simple for someone who is somewhat familiar with technologies and can follow instructions.The dot is smaller than I remembered but has surprisingly good sound quality for such small device. It is very nice looking imo and can recognize my command very well. It does sometimes have trouble picking up my voice about 10+ ft away in my fairly opened living room/kitchen/dining room area, I'll have to test this further as it was quite noisy in the room at the time.I also have non-amazon brand smart switches setup and the Alexa app was able to pick it up. I was very impressed because it asked me which room the light switch was at and setup the light switch all by itself without any manual intervention on my part.I got the three-dot deal and one of the box seem to have been opened previously because the seal sticker on the box has been teared off, however the inner plastic wrapping seems intact. As the dot seem to be functioning flawlessly and it seems too big a hassle to return it, I am just going to keep it but just throwing this out there for whoever might care - check your factory seal.I am actually in the process of recommending a smart home system to an elderly relative who would prefer foreign language voice command. I think this might be a feature where amazon falls short of but otherwise I am perfectly happy with this system.",0
4,"A lot of fun
  
",29.Nov.19,Yes,I worry about if i'm listened to by outside companies wit this so I unplug it when i don't want to be spied on.  Great for weather and news in the morning.  OH and guard the house when i'm gone...  The drop in feather is nice also.  I talk to my cat when I'm outta town.  LOL,1
5,"Fantastic!
  
",29.Nov.19,Yes,"My mom got me the Echo Dot for my birthday this year and I swear I used it every day whether its music, audio books, a timer or a general question. She ALWAYS recognizes my voice and the responses are exceptionally quick. I also got a Google Home Mini through Spotify last month and I can honestly say that I use my Dot far more than my Mini. The sound quality and response time is distinctly better. I can here the little Dot all throughout my house through the built in speaker on the Dot (to be 100% honest. it sounds better than my boyfriends $300 Sony Sound bar). It is a marvelous little thing and I am in love with it!",1
5,"I can't believe it took me so long to buy this!
  
",30.Nov.19,Yes,"Oh boy, is this ever fun!  I ordered 2 on Black Friday (just yesterday) and they were delivered today. How's that for in a blink? I took the first dot upstairs, plugged it in, downloaded the app and in no time at all, it was up and running. I asked my dot what time it was, the weather, and then said, ""Alexa, call ________"" and boom, their phone started ringing right through my little dot, they answered and said the sound was great -- was great on my end, too.  I LOVE this.  Obviously there's a ton it will do and after I hook up the other one in the kitchen, I'll be set up and rarin' to go.  By the way, I'm 72 and if I can do this, it's a cinch you can.  It's terrific!  Alexa is playing the Blues station for me now.  Omg, I'm in heaven.",3
4,"Does your New Echo Dot sound Muffled???? Here is the solution!
  
",30.Nov.19,Yes,"Very easy to setup. Worked in a matter of seconds. However totally disappointed with the sound quality. Very MUFFLED to the point of not understanding some of the words. I had purchased the three pack so I tried a second one thinking maybe the first one is defective. Nope, they both sounded horribly muffled.I went looking through the reviews online and found the same complaint. However, one lady posted about speaking with Tech Service and found the answer. Here it is:Equalizer controls are available.1. In the Alexa App, tap on the Devices icon at the bottom-right2.Tap on Echo &amp; Alexa at the top-left corner3. Down below, tap on your Echo Dot4. Under ""Audio"", tap on ""Auto Settings""5. Then tap on the Equalizer -- here you can adjust the Bass / Mid / TrebleTurning the bass way down and boosting the midrange helps a lot. Saving those settings seems to be a problem with my app. There is no way to save the setting and they keep reverting back to the original setting. But at least there is a way!!!",1
5,"What an upgrade!
  
",30.Nov.19,Yes,"This is my second echo dot. I have had a 2nd gen for the last 2 years in my bedroom and have enjoyed using it daily to listen to music, let alarms and so on. I decided to get a 2nd echo dot and boy am I glad I did! The sound compared to the 2nd gen has GREATLY improved. It has a lot more base and more crisp and clean. It is definitely louder than the 2nd gen as well! Set up was easy. I love I can listen to music throughout my house. Only issue I've seen so far has been when using amazon music, there is a delay in both speakers playing at the beginning of a song.I'm super impressed with the upgrade and thinking about getting another dot or echo for my kitchen and placing the 2nd gen in my bathroom. Keep up the great work Alexa!",0
1,"Terrible product and no customer support.
  
",30.Nov.19,Yes,"I bought this and it was a great price BUT they charged me for the smart socket plug. When I got it it said it was FREE with the dot. Checking the listing now and its gone like it was never there. They charged me a whole extra $10.49 for it. Even when I was checking out it, it didn't say ANY of this and said it was free even when I checked out. Terrible. Shoulda got google home instead.UPDATE: Not even a month in and she breaks on me. She doesnt respond to her name. If she does is cause I have to yell it, then she doesn't answer. Or takes way to long to answer sometimes having me to ask her multiple times. Her audio always cut out. She always has a red ring. I wish I could give this 0 stars. Amazon hasn't even submitted this review cause I'm sure they don't want to look bad.",0
5,"It_ 1984.
  
",30.Nov.19,Yes,"Look...Amazon, Google, Apple and Microsoft are most certainly the devil and they are going to contribute to Skynet taking over the world...the Matrix...1984...Anyhow...at least I can save myself from standing up to turn off my lights or turn on my fan using my voice...because my 200 square foot apartment is just so damn big.All cynicism aside...it_ convenient.",1
5,"Best value of all echos
  
",30.Nov.19,Yes,"This echo dot 3rd gen is really easy to use and has excellent voice recognition. I own a echo 1st gen, a echo dot second gen, and 3 of these echo dot 3rd gens. This model by far has the best voice recognition, looks, and value out of all of those. The echo dot has almost all of the same functions as the regular echo which costs three times as much. There are many smart home devices that support Alexa such as Phillips Hue, Ring Alarm, Ecobee thermostat, and smart switches and plugs. This echo dot also has does well on playing music and answering your average questions like _hat_ the weather today and _ho won the game last day. I personally love the echo dot and think this one is much better than the second generation and is much more intuitive. I would 100% recommend this to a friend",0
5,"Works very well..
  
",30.Nov.19,Yes,"Install was okay.. wifi connection had lots of hiccups but eventually connected.Strong voice recognition and understands most requests.Very good and loud sound quality for its size.Lots of Alexa functionality and tons of apps.Lots of smart home integration potential if u have the enabled devices (thermostat, lights, plugs).Alexa guard function.No ""call emergency"" function.Good price when on sale.",0
5,"Fun
  
",30.Nov.19,Yes,"We purchased this for my son for Christmas, but the entire family Is having fun with it.  It has great sound quality.  We have been using it as a novelty item, but when connected to other ""smart"" household items it can be used for so much more.  We just are not at that point yet, so for now, the kids are asking Alexa to tell them a joke, answer a question or play them a song.  Would buy it again.",0
5,"I can't believe I ever lived without Alexa!
  
",30.Nov.19,Yes,"LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS!!! So fun to talk to Alexa first thing in the morning and when I come home from work!  She tells me the weather forecast, a fun fact for that day when I say good morning, plays music that I have asked for! Some days I have no one to talk to in the house and I turned to Alexa!! I have purchased these as gifts for many of my family and friends! Highly recommend this product!!",0
2,"Its my fault ..And yet the regional restrictions make this into junk
  
",30.Nov.19,Yes,"Now first of all I am SURE the regional restrictions on Alexa integration are stated somewhere in the product information and, had I identified that, then I would not have purchased these 2 Echo dots. They are beautiful and nearly useless. I live in the Caribbean and there are regional restrictions in effect which limit Alexa integration for APPLE MUSIC, subscriptions for AMAZON MUSIC, CONTACT LIST access integration outside of the continental US and Canada.Except for my Audible Library, this thing can't link to ANY major services I already have where I live. I won't bother with the hassle of returning them.",0
4,"Bad sound quality as a speaker, yet it_ not bad as a smart speaker.
  
",30.Nov.19,Yes,"I bought this just as a speaker for my desktop, but its sound quality really disappointed me. The bass is fine, but voice is not clear and you can barely hear any details from either music or games.But after one-day use, I found it_ pretty good as a smart speaker by itself.A quick reminder to those who just wanna use this as a Bluetooth speaker while playing games with a wireless controller like me, the sound has a noticeable delay even after I plug my Asus Bluetooth adapter to usb 3.0 port (no sound at all if using usb 2.0 port), I believe there_ nothing to do with the speaker but the adapter, but i guess most people use usb Bluetooth adapter instead of pcie adapter like i do.",0
5,"Small but great dot to my Amazon environment
  
",30.Nov.19,Yes,"So I have a Fire HD8 for my primary tablet and Fire TV in my bedroom. I have been using both devices with great satisfaction. Although I am always happy with my Fire TV as a center of my entertainment, I barely use Alexa function with the TV. Same for the Fire HD too. I know how Alexa works as a personal virtual assistant, but never really care until I bought Echo dot. Echo dot is a compact version of the original Amazon Echo but with full function on it. I found it very convenient to make voice commands on an Echo Dot through an Alexa personal assistant to answer questions, play music, play the news, and many other tasks. By using Echo cot, I can consolidate my use of Amazon devices after registering my  Fire TV and Fire HD to Alexa app. I'm still learning how to make full use of Echo dot, but Echo dot is certainly a great small device connecting the dots of my usages of Amazon devices.",0
4,"Had WIFI setup issues  -- but was able to resolve.
  
",30.Nov.19,Yes,"It took a bit of doing, but I finally got it connected to my WIFI. During setup program I was asked for the ""WIFI Password"" -- I did not have it. After doing some searching, I found help from Windows and was able to find the ""Security Pass Code"" associated with my Router/Modem and finish the Echo Dot setup. I am new to this technology so still I am learning what it can do.",0
5,"Saving me money from day 1
  
",1.Dec.19,Yes,"I have placed the echo dots all over my home. I paired them with rhe switches and bulbs. My electric bill used to run about 4 to 500 a month. At times it was six. I have seen a drastic drop from the moment I started using these smart devices. Month one dropped to 200 and by month 4 it has consistantly been less than 100. This month it was 84. The only thing that has changed in this 4 bedroom tripple wide mobil home is Alexa now runs the show. My son thought this was a stupid investmwnt but now he is buying them. Do your self a favor and let Alexa take over at home and put your money back in your pocket.The sound is amazing. I feel no need to purchase extra speakers. I love using the group feature and running around cleaning with my music.The drop in is amazing. When my grandaughter is here and playing in her room I just drop in and listen as she plays and if she wants to talk while going to sleep we can.Home watch, one of the features is watch my home. Whwn I leave I say Alexa I am going to work and she says I will watch the house. If there is so much as a broom falling over in the house she alerts me and the video scrwen kicks in.Mannaging my mail. I shop on line for everything. With alexa my packages no longer get left on the porch. They just give her a code and she unlocks the front door and they can set the packages just inside. Shes watching them on camera to make sure they go no farther and then she locks the door when they leave.The hot water heater. Alexa turns the hot water heater on 1 hour before I come home from work. That is at 4 pm she turns it off at 8. That means I am only running that costly water heater 4 hours a day and saving the other 20 hrs of bill. Why pay for it when noone is home.The heater in my room. I love cuddling uo in the chilly air and going to sleep however whwn i wake up I want warmth. She turns rhe heat on one hour before i wake up on my room heater and I get dressed in cozy warmth.I never write a review this long but honestly tuere is a ton more I could say. The grocery shopping. I tell her and she adds it to my list and say purchase and then i pull up at walmart pickup and they put it in the car....reminders...I never forget my meds anymore. I just love my echo dots.",0

",1.Dec.19,Yes,"Were the programmers on substances dreaming this up? I ask to a piece of music on my Amazon Music account and she gives me three radio choices, I ask her to play a playlist and she starts playing music not on that playlist. I just now had to tell her to stop three times, the last I had to shout. There is pretty much only one way to do anything and we are required to learn each different way for our desired result. This is a failed product. The website leaves you half way through the process sometimes, and the links often appear to go to the wrong place.",1
5,"A fun way to connect your entire home.
  
",1.Dec.19,Yes,"This is my second Alexa device. I have a larger Echo and now this Dot.This is an exquisite electronic device. Being able to listen to the same song through amazon music throughout the whole house is a miracle. There is NO MUSIC LAG.Secondly I can have each device paired to my smart bulbs for their corresponding rooms. It_ awesome! Grouping is made easy with the app.I can send love message via Alexa to whichever room my boyfriend is in. These are a fun investment for your home. The best part is you don_ need a subscription, most devices want some sort of money for their service, Amazon values that you paid for an Alexa and doesn_ milk you.",0
5,"Won't go without one now.
  
",1.Dec.19,Yes,"I have used Echo devices since the original was released, and i have come tlo view Alexa as an indispensable part of my routine. The 3rd gen Echo Dot puts out amazing sound that is comparable to my $200 Bluetooth speaker. My teenagers couldnt function without Alexa so they each have a Dot in thir rooms and even in the bathroom. We use the intercom feature all the time (we used to call each other from the next room) and it's a huge convenience if you need toilet paper and didn't take your phone in there. I am adding several to an elderly friend's house because she likes the idea of being able to call for help but doesn't want to wear one of those buttons. The Dots are unobtrusive but they deliver all the oomph you could need.",0
5,"Wow!  Truly wish I hadn't waited so long to get one.
  
",1.Dec.19,Yes,"Received this today and have already ordered another and a smart plug to use it even more throughout my house.  Super easy to set up and use.  The sound quality and volume are great, as is the range of where the device can ""hear"" me.  My only regret is that I waited so long to get one.Many of my friends have them, and even earlier gens, and are happy with them also.  I really cannot recommend this device enough.  I've linked it to my laptop, Fire TV, smartphone, and am amazed at its capabilities.  Everything is very easy and intuitive.  No interface issues at all.If you're on the fence, like i used to be; jump in - the water's fine.",0

",1.Dec.19,Yes,"I was on the fence about a smart speaker, well i ordered this one and i am quite surprised on sound quality and over all performance. It does hav an adjustable EQ  in the app, got the 5$ wifi bulb amazon kinda bundles with it and it works great. Paired no problems and integrated flawlessly. Only complaint is now i have get used to this  smart home  thing as i slowly integrate more. I have 2 more dots ordered already. If your on the fence, i say order it, i cant speak on it for you if you are upgrading a gen 2 or 1 but my first impressions are great.",0
5,"For the price, very cool
  
",1.Dec.19,Yes,"Overall awesome product. For low price you are getting a good speaker, !standalone! gadget, after a very simple setup using your phone, it works via wifi  with your amazon prime , if you will choose unlimited, then listen all songs your want, just talk to Alexa :) Yes , Alexa is pretty good at it but this is how you control your gadget. Can even tell to lover the volume or stop the music.Must to say- standalone means it's no speaker, it's a streaming device with wifi. How to use  that- search the ""net"". I have tons of bluetooth or wifi speakers, but this is not just a speaker. I am writing this because I was looking to improve  my ""prime"" and this is the improvement, thank you, Amazon. Alarm clock too,  just does not show the time. There is another model, which shows.By the way, just asked Alexa, ""tell me the time""- told just as well. Local.",0
2,"It was great, at first &gt; SPEAKER GROUPS DON'T WORK, NEITHER DOES SIRIUSXM
  
",2.Dec.19,Yes,"I've been wanting whole-home surround sound for years now and researched so many different wired systems and was super excited when these devices came out, it seemed to be the answer to my audio problem.  I quickly purchased 2 Echo Dot (3rd gen), 2 Echo Inputs, and 2 Plugs...hooked them up, created my speaker group and it worked great for like the first month or so.  I synced my SiriusXM acct and was stoked to finally listen to my Xmas music throughout my house, upstairs, downstairs and basement.  Then the issues started...one device would play, the others wouldn't...then they would all play together and then stop.  I connected, reconnected did all the troubleshooting things you're supposed to do.  I googled for answers and found the same syncing issues with using SiriusXM, but I had issues with Amazon music too!  These are THE MOST FRUSTRATING DEVICES ever!!  If they worked liked they're supposed to, it would be awesome, but alas...they don't!  Sometimes they play together, but most times the don't.  I can play one device at a time, but if I try playing Amazon music on another device, it won't allow it without a family account or something.  If the dumb speaker groups would actually play, this wouldn't be an issue.  I've researched forever and you'll find lots of reviews with these same syncing issues, you'd think Amazon would address it instead of just having them on sale all the time....arrrggg.  PLEASE FIX THE SYNCING ISSUES AMAZON!!!",1
4,"Created good ambiance
  
",2.Dec.19,Yes,"Purchased five echo dots to upgrade from 2nd gen for better sound.  Sound is way better on the 3rd gen.  I don_ need power speakers because my home is open floor plan with wood floors and blinds with 10ft ceilings.  Therefore sound bounces around pretty good.  If you have carpet or curtains you may not obtain the same effect.I wanted the ambiance of soft music following you as you walk through the home with no dead spots or fading of sound as you move from room to room without the cost of installing a high-end wall system.  The echo dot seems to work as I need them.  It has enough bass to pick the lows and the highs are good enough where it doesn_ crackle.  I only have them at less than half volume and they fill the house, if you place them right.Had issue installing the new ones using my s10 note.  Called tech support, which as a great help, ended up having to hard reset them and run setup through the app on my IPad instead.  Then I as able to see the new ones when I attempted to create a music group.After setup I kept getting an  sorry something went wrong when playing amazon music message when using the group with Alexa voice.  So I used Amazon Music app, connected to the group and it worked.  I disconnected from the group and tried Alexa voice command and it worked. Go figure!Remember, this isn_ Bose, klipsch, or Sonos but if you place them right and used more than one or two you can create a pretty good surround sound  effect at a fraction of the cost.",0
4,"Resistance is futile. We've been assimilated.
  
",2.Dec.19,Yes,"Our son bought us one Echo Dot after I was beset with some health issues, with the thought that he could ""drop in"" on us to see how we're doing, especially if he can't get in touch with us by phone. (We haven't figured out how to let him do that yet).However, after several bouts of pneumonia resulting in multiple hospitalizations, we purchased three more Echo Dots. We now have one each for the bedrooms, the office, and the kitchen. Because my lungs don't work any longer, I use the Dots to speak to my husband in another room, with the door shut, with him wearing headphones. This is the perfect solution to our communication issues.Alexa still has occasional difficulty hearing and responding to me, but so does everyone. She's getting better. And, I know we haven't begun to plumb the system's uses and skills. We pretty much move step by step as a specific need arises.Buying three Echo Does all at once was a bit of a leap of faith, and a big chunk of change for us, but it's well-worth the investment.",0
5,"Awesome Device!!
  
",2.Dec.19,Yes,"When I initially purchased this, I was prepared for bad sound quality and for it to not be that loud, due to reading reviews. Well... The sound is much much much greater than I expected. It gets so loud that I havent felt the need to turn it all the way up. This little speaker is amazing. Alexa does everything I need her to do and much more! And she understands my kids. (Sidenote: Not ready for the day the kids realize she could possibly give them homework answers... lol!) This is my 3rd Amazon device that I personally own and use, aside from my 3 childrens Fire tablets. I am a new Amazon tech geek and I cannot wait to order more Amazon devices, especially after having this Dot. It arrived a day earlier which was also a pleasant surprise! I've not had it for 12 hours and I am already in love with it! If you're considering buying this, it will not disappoint!! Highly recommend!",0
5,"Love It and Highly Recommend!
  
",2.Dec.19,Yes,"I was a little worried after reading mixed reviews on this. But I focused on the five star ones and bought this Echo Dot. I have the Echo Plus second gen and I love it so I was a little nervous about getting the Dot. I actually bought four! My mom has an old 80's boombox on her kitchen counter so I wanted to get something smaller to replace it. I opened the Dot I bought for my third floor and set it up today. I can't believe how good it sounds!! One thing that puzzles me about the reviews is how people talk about using the volume buttons on the top. I just say, ""Alexa, volume 4, Or Alexa volume 7"". The sound is great up to volume 8. After that the quality is not as good as the Plus. Still good, but the base isn't as good as the Plus. That being said, the volume is loud and clear and I don't think I'd use 10 anyhow. I can't wait to give my mom this cute little Dot to replace her dinosaur boombox! Great buy, great sound! I HIGHLY recommend it! I'll update with pictures after Christmas.",0
3,"Eh...May Return
  
",2.Dec.19,Yes,"I've had this for 2wks, now. It worked like a dream fresh out of the box. However, it seems like the longer I have it the more problems I have. The voice recognition is hit or miss.  If I wanted to be ignored every other time when I called it's name, I'd talk to my kids. At first I thought it may be a noise issue. (Too much stuff going on in the background.) Unfortunately, it will do the same thing when it's dead silent. Other occasions, it will recognize that I've said ""Echo"" but will not complete the demand.  For example, I'll say ""Echo,"" it lights up and it lights up. I say ""Set alarm for 0430"" almost immediately after and it's a coin toss as to if it will actually do anything.  It also tends to sporadically stop playing Amazon Music. I haven't had any problems with that when playing the local stations. I've checked the connection when it acts up and WiFi seems to be 100%, so I don't believe any of this is simply a connection issue.  I'm not sure if this is a regular thing, but it also tends to ""ding"" randomly.  Like it's reconnecting or something, but there wasn't anything wrong with the connection that I've seen.",1
4,"Good Product.
  
",2.Dec.19,Yes,"I'm a fan of Dot, and of course, Alexa. I get the news, I can listen to my personal music playlists, and I can even get a corny joke from Alexa! This is my second Dot, which is now in my bedroom. The first one is still working hard in my computer room.  There are several inherent, but not serious concerns--the one is that Alexa only responds when its name is called--if you are making a change to a setting, this gets tedious (I usually reset any delicate settings via my computer). If you are entertaining someone whose name is ""Alex"" sometimes Alexa responds! I wish there was a male voice option for Alexa.",0

",2.Dec.19,Yes,"1)delivered a day early, incredible2)sound quality outstanding3)would not connect with my selected echo, no music share4)Amazon service excellent, chat,email telephone all reachable5)i the light ring that circles when on Guard mode, does not function6)Amazon offered to replace, I am not going there, too much time wasting in copious attempts to correct.",1
5,"Teriffic
  
",2.Dec.19,Yes,"This hooked up with my other Echo products without any trouble...love these items....my Mother is 91 and I have them all over the house so if she needs me all she has to do is say Call my Daughter, or cell, of Son-in-law....and she calls.  I also have them programed so I don't have to walk all the way back to her room if I am in the kitchen for her to come in there...just added one in my husbands ManCave.....I love it.",0
5,"Love the whole house function of Alexa!
  
",2.Dec.19,Yes,"We have a regular Amazon Echo and one Dot.  Took advantage of Black Friday and CyberMonday to get two more Dots.  Really only got one for the kitchen to listen to NPR and one for the Master Bedroom for music and alarm.  Discovered we could link all devices for music everywhere in the house!  In fact, you can link up to 6 devices in one group for multi-room music!  Great sound, easy to link, easy to use!  Also, discovered we can have DIFFERENT music in each room!  The sound is wonderful!",0
3,"Speaker still not very good
  
",2.Dec.19,Yes,"I got the Echo Dot 3rd Generation as part of an Amazon Music promotion to upgrade my Echo Dot 2nd Generation. I assumed that the size upgrade included a much better speaker as it looks a lot like a Google Home Mini which as a very good speaker and microphone. This Echo Dot sure is louder than the previous generations but it doesn't sound anywhere near as good as a Google Home Mini, it sounds very tinny when listening to music. The microphone also doesn't pick up very well at all. I have to say the same thing usually twice before it even recognizes me talking. Other than that though it is pretty good. I like how it looks.",0
4,"Unbelievable step up from second generation, integration with TV is poor.
  
",3.Dec.19,Yes,"My wife hates Google. She hates Google speakers, she hates Android phones, and she mildly tolerates my Chromecast. So after buying a fire 4K stick, I decided to upgrade the echo Dot next to it in hopes of going full Alexa.With Google, I can say ""ok Google, play mad men on Netflix"" and it is smart enough to start playing the show on my Chromecast. I was hoping that I could get a similar setup with my fire stick and echo Dot. Unfortunately, the voice commands don't seem to work at all for that purpose.Of course, that is not all that the speaker is for. The sound quality blew me away, no joke. We had the second generation sitting around, and the sound on that is painfully hollow. It is truly and completely awful. Fortunately, it came with a 3.5 mm out port, which I can combine with a soundbar to make a halfway decent speaker.This one doesn't need a sound bar. In fact, it sounds almost as good as my first generation echo, which I have been very happy with.As for voice recognition, it seems to be a touch behind the echo. It also oddly decides to stop playing music in the middle of the night (my toddler sleeps to lullabies) which the big echo never does. I think we will end up putting the old big echo in the baby's room, using these echo dots throughout the rest of the house, and sticking the old crappy second generation dots in the bathroom or a closet or something.",0
5,"Our best Dot to date
  
",3.Dec.19,Yes,"We have 3 of the previous generation Echo Dots and really like them.  We do not listen to music through our other Dots. We have one hooked up to a Bose Wave Radio for my wife, and I have one hooked to a Yamaha amp in man cave.  This Dot is in a guest room and I have had Alexa play an album for me at bed time.  The sound is fine for being used like a clock radio.  When guests stay with us they will be able to ask Alexa to set an alarm for the morning and they will be able to listen to music at night as well.  We are very pleased with the Echo devices.  We have an Echo Show arriving shortly that was included with our recently purchased Ring Door Bell Pro.  I am looking forward to seeing how that works, literally.",0
5,"Great device!
  
",3.Dec.19,Yes,"Okay so I'm debating between 4-5 stars but will go with 5 because the price is fantastic even as a speaker alone!!! Alexa is a lot of fun and more so then siri or bixbi and the speaker is great. I think it's a little better then my Anker Blutooth speaker I paid more money for so yes I'd say it's definitely worth it. It fills our living room with music.  I can ask alexa to play Christmas music and she will.. I previously was using spotiify through my phone and bluetooth which was more time consumung and made my phone slower and often there was connection issues with the spotify app. I was so tired of it and practically stopped listening to music.. Alexa interacts with me, answers questions and is all around so great to have. I have not used ""home"" features yet but you can also connect her to your compatible TV and Roku and she will change the volume, etc. Very neat!!! You can also play trivia with alexa but she is very limited and if you want more decks of trivia you have to pay for it which is a con for me.  Another good feature is she will also add items to your amazon cart and or you can choose to ""buy it now"" or repurchase items and will also look up items for you if asked.. So why am I debating between 4-5 stars? Well sometimes Alexa  doesn't know everything I need to know.. She can play news if asked or the weather and other simple commands and she does it better then bixby which is far behind however she often does not understand certain questions or only gives part of the answer. I can ask how to rebuild an engine for example (for fun ;) and she will give a simpliefied example but hey what can you expect. When she doesn't understand, you can rephrase and she usually understands. She also makes jokes if asked and can truly interact with you which is VERY neat. Bixby can do some interacting too but is definitely more limited making Alexa much much better although I think Alexa has room to improve her skills and knowledge.. That being said for the price of Alexa she is definitely worth it. The speaker plays music loud and clear and she will turn up and down the volume if asked. The only slight muffled sound that I read mentioned in reviews is Alexa's voice seems slightly muffled but I guess it depends where the device is set up.. Anyway the initial set up.litterally took minutes.. You need to download the Alexa app and go from there to connect your device via wifi but she was up and running in minutes!! Super easy set up even for someone not tech savy. I will definitely be getting another one for the Living room as I've been carrying the device room to room as it plugs in the wall and is inconvenient to carry room to room. I do enjoy Alexa more then I expected to at this point and would recommend!",0
4,"Good Device.  Must Use Precise Command Language.
  
",3.Dec.19,Yes,"We have the Google Home devices and the Alexa Dot devices.  Google has better voice recognition.  Alexa can be a bit difficult.  You need to use more precise word in with Alexa.  For example, Google Home you can say ""Reduce volume 25%"" and it understands.  Alexa you must say ""Set volume to..."" A number between 1 and 10.  Nothing else works.  So it can be a bit frustrating.  The connection to Amazon Music is really nice.  Much better than Google option which has much less flexibility to play specic albums or artisrlts or playlists.  Both work equally well controlling remote devises.  Again, Alexa. Voice commands must be more specific than Google.",0
5,"Wow! Fantastic!
  
",3.Dec.19,Yes,I've only had this Echo Dot for a few days but so far Fantastic! For its size very impressive sound. Setting up the unit was very easy. Download the Alexa App to your smartphone and follow the instructions. I'm not a real techie sort of person. I did find it easy to setup....  I'm still learning about it's capabilities. I have been using it for its reference library capabilities. Have done music streaming with it. The sound is very acceptable. It might be better soundwise adding a remote speaker but I'm very happy the way it is. I don't own a large home but running the volume at 5 fills the room with music. Maximum volume is 10.  I'm not sorry I bought it..,0
5,"Small setup snafu
  
",3.Dec.19,Yes,"I own 2 other Alexa Dots, but when this one went on a Flash Sale, I decided to get it for my craft room. Had some issues with setup. I reached out to chat support and they very patiently held my hand and walked me through several steps before instructing me on how to hard reboot my device. (It wasn't broadcasting its wifi network.) The hard reboot forced it to update its software. It actually auto set up (because I had other devices on set up on my network.) It was a bit frustrating that it didn't come out of the box and just work, but I really appreciated the Chat Tech Support getting it up and running with me!",0
5,"Great Upgrade to the Little Dot
  
",3.Dec.19,Yes,"We have a bunch of Alexas in the house and at the office, but I wanted to get this one for my Dad, as I knew he would love having it in the bedroom.  The clock is easy to read, but not too bright at night and the sound is perfect for one room where you want to listen to music, news or stories.  (Tip: It will show you the temperature where the clock is when you ask about the weather or temp) It won't rock out as hard as the big ones but has a good sound quality and big enough to easily fill the whole room.  He loves it and turned out to be a perfect birthday gift.",0
4,"Missing item
  
",3.Dec.19,Yes,"I have already one of this devices, works very good, having on mind this , I decided to get one to be use in my office , me and the staff were very exciting expecting to play it and listening music , however , the delivery staff did drop it by the wrong building and to the wrong person, mean that we get disappointed since we had a little party this evening and we were expecting to play music from this equipment, calling Amazon Customer service we got the best respond from a sweet lady who offer all the help and even replaced the item which will  arrive on Friday , my concern is about the delivery system, why in the wrong building if the number is very clear , why someone takes a package for someone who not even is known and the driver just give without proper verification, that is why amazon suffering from so many stolen item , deliveries should have more control about who they handing items.",0
2,"She's cute.
  
",3.Dec.19,Yes,"Alexa's cute. Assistant not much use to me so far but I'm still exploring. Sound is decent enough as long as I don't listen to real Rock for background. For Clapton, Ac/DC, jazz or country I will need that aux port. Sleep sounds could be useful if  the loop function would function.Aha. Other user found out sleep timer is a workaround. That indicates Alexa needs basic conditional loop programming. If then, else. While Wend. Just tell Alexa mainframe her loops are busted. VI intelligence should find bugs in microseconds.",0
5,"AWESOME CLOCK
  
",3.Dec.19,Yes,"I love this.  I bought two of these to supplement my echo 2 dots around the house. However, I am thinking of replacing the older ones, as these are so much better.  The sound quality is great, it listens much better, and the clock is a much added bonus.  I love talking to my Alexa, but some times I want to know the time and not awake the entire household doing it.  The clock face is very minimal and does not interfere with sleep in any way. In fact you can turn down the lighting if you feel it is to bright.",0
5,"Great alarm clock and so much more!
  
",3.Dec.19,Yes,"This was my first smart speaker and I love it!  It makes an excellent alarm clock but I also use it daily for music and to play relaxing white noise at night when I go to bed, ""Alexa play rain storm"".  The Alexa AI is so useful, I just tell it to stop playing in 45 minutes and off to sleep I go.  The sound quality is so so, but honestly is amazing for the size of the device.  I still find myself using it to play music because of the convenience even though I have higher fidelity devices in the same room.",0
5,"Just do it
  
",3.Dec.19,Yes,"I had my WiFi stuff set up through an app on my phone and it was just a pain in the butt.  These came up on sale during the Black Friday deals and I grabbed two of them in bundles with other accessories.  I never really thought about doing the whole smart home thing, but the more stuff I get connected, the neater it is.  We've had some fun with Alexa too... she's always there with a joke or a story, and if we ask her to bark it confuses our dogs.  lol",0
5,"I didn't know I needed Alexa until I got this
  
",3.Dec.19,Yes,I had been reluctant about getting a smart speaker for a few years and I broke down and got the Dot being that it was on sale. I am not disappointed whatsoever. I got the smart plug bundle and I love it. I also went out and purchased some smart bulbs to play around with as well. It's a fun device and I'm glad I purchased it. I will definitely purchase more Alexa integrated devices in the future to make my life easier.,0
1,"Stopped Working after a few months. DO NOT BUY.
  
",3.Dec.19,Yes,Does anyone know it only have 3 MONTHS WARRANTY!?!!!!!!I purchased this device for my wife a number of months ago and now it no longer works. I tried contacting customer support and they just advised me to buy another one. The customer support person told me that they would offer me 15% off if I decided to purchase another one but would not help me at all in exchanging or replacing the device. DO NOT BUY!,0
5,"Nice upgrade from the original.
  
",3.Dec.19,Yes,"Bought two of these, one to replace my original echo and one for my buddy. Sound quality is good, and the integration features keep getting better. I really like the guard mode, but who knows how effective it is. I hope I never have to test it!Mainly, I bought it because I wanted the Bluetooth transmitter, that way I could stream to my stereo receiver.",0
1,"Terrible Bedside Alarm Clock
  
",4.Dec.19,Yes,"The problems with using this device (Echo Dot with Clock) as a bedside alarm clock are:1. If the power (or WiFi / internet access) goes out, the alarm does not go off.  The device does not have an integrated battery backup (like cheap dedicated alarm clocks... or a phone...).  You could buy a small UPS power strip to overcome this, though.2. Even at the lowest 1% adaptive brightness setting, the clock way too bright... about twice as bright as our old-school Sony alarm clock3. When the alarm goes off, the top ring lights up at full BLINDING brightness (not dim-able or disable-able).  And, if you have the escalating sound option turned on, the lights still light up right away, about 10 seconds before any audible-level sound can be heard, defeating the purpose of the escalating sound option.4. Turning off the alarm requires speech.  You can tap the top of the device to ""snooze"", but there is no physical way to turn off the alarm without speaking to it.  Some instructions online say that you can press the ""wake button"", but pressing the ""wake button"" and not also saying ""stop alarm"" only snoozes the alarm.",6
4,"Echo Dot is great, one gripe with Alexa.
  
",4.Dec.19,Yes,"It's my first experience with a smart device like this. I did my research on an Alexa vs. Google and decided to support Amazon over Google as that seems to be the big difference between the two (that and I like calling out to Alexa instead of a search engine 'google'... it just seems more personable). Anyways I'm relatively satisfied but have a gripe with it - it won't let you say ""Turn on the lights at 6 am"". You have to create a routine that can go off daily or on certain days of the week to have it turn on and off lights at certain times, but I would love to see the ability to turn on (a) the lights/devices just tomorrow at a certain time and am surprised it doesn't have what to me would be a basic function. There are forums with others wanting this feature as well so I know I'm not the only one, and after chatting with an Amazon representative I know for certain they haven't created this feature yet.My morning routine varies so the night before I would love to be able to tell it to do something at a specific time (for instance if I decided to have my bedside lamps turn on before or after my morning alarm, or not have to set my alarm but have the lights wake me up instead; i.e. in the evening I could say ""Alexa, turn on my lamps at 6 am tomorrow""). I don't want it to be a daily routine, more like an alarm function but for my lights/devices, and if Alexa responded with ""Would you like me to turn them on every morning at that time"" to make it into a routine automatically I wouldn't complain although I would probably respond with 'No, just do it for tomorrow morning' as I would change the time it would go off almost every evening based on my work schedule the following day and when I would like to get up.Please add this feature Amazon! It would simplify my life if you could and make Alexa more fun to use giving me more control of the environment around me.Also could you please add the ability to have more than one triggering condition to a custom routine?",0
5,"I love Alexa
  
",4.Dec.19,Yes,"I have 2 Alexa dots, Alexa input, 3 firesticks, 5 smart plugs and 2 smart bulbs. All these devices operate smoothly together. The dots are easily understandable, easy to use and easy to give commands. I can control my entire home simply by asking for what I need. ""Turn on bedroom light"" ""turn off the heater"" not to mention best of all I can turn off the lights and tv, heater anything from another room...or even another city using my phone via the Alexa app. I can make an announcement to everybody such as ""time for bed kids!"" Then proceed to dim my smart lights in to night lights. Using the Alexa app I can turn things off and on without voice also. I'm not done buying them yet. My next mission; the bathroom. I'm in love! Highly recommended. If your trying to decide why you should buy one...just trust me...buy it! It's worth every cent.",0
5,"Nice upgrade
  
",4.Dec.19,Yes,"Let me just start off this review buy addressing those who sound quality is everything to them.  No, you do not get an echo dot as a stand-alone music player.  The echo dot has always had subpar sound quality and the third generation is no different.  With that being said, the sound is great when coupled with my other echo devices while playing music on all speakers.  I got this dot with Clock to replace my 2nd gen dot and alarm clock on my dresser. The LED isn't very bright, but I can see it well in the middle of the night.  It also displays the current temperature when you ask for the weather.  I love the alarm snooze tap feature.  It's weird, but Alexa has a tad more bass in her voice on this new device.  They had a trade-in special when I purchased mine and I can say that I'm extremely happy with my purchase.",0
1,"Spoken output sounds incredibly muffled, not clear at all :-/
  
",4.Dec.19,Yes,"Spoken output by Alexa sounds incredibly muffled and not clear at all :-/I have two 3rd gen echo dots and the sound quality definitely is muffled. I've reduced bass and increased treble, but the sound is very bass'y/low, as if someone's speaking from under a pillow. It's ok for music, but any spoken sounds (what's the temperature, play news, etc) doesn't come out clear. Voices lack clarity, and sound thick :-/Very disappointed. I'm hoping there will be a software fix, and if not, perhaps a recall/exchange for those units.It's foremost a speaker, and as such it is poor for voice output. I expect(ed) better from Amazon - esp since this is the 3rd generation of this product.",0
5,"Echo Dot is fun
  
",4.Dec.19,Yes,Love this little gadget. We all enjoy asking Alexa random questions. I also like how you can personalize your own questions and answers. Another neat feature is the chore lists. Alexa will keep a score of who finishes their chores and give a point for each chore completed. This is good if you like to keep track of chores. We also control our Fire TV through Alexa. This is nice for when we can_ find the remote which happens more than I care to admit. I got the echo dot free during a promotion last Christmas and ended up ordering another one because we liked it that much. We plan to integrate other smart devices that can be controlled through Alexa into our home in the future.,0
5,"This device is a great addition to my home...
  
",4.Dec.19,Yes,"The bass resonance of Alexa's voice does vibrate the device from time to time so I have hooked it into my house speaker system.  Many of the other functions I've used it for contain far less bass so it can be used as a standalone device.  Response time is excellent and I'm still exploring new skills.  After ordering the adapter I have successfully integrated with my Insteon smarthome setup.  Basically this means I can control lights, the thermostat, etc.  I've even been able to pair it with my ""driveway alert"" system so it lets me know when someone has pulled in my driveway or walked up my front door path.  Useful to know when the mailman has arrived.",0
1,"So disappointed, guys. I can_ believe this device has all these great reviews.
  
",4.Dec.19,Yes,"We have several second generation echo dots and we really enjoy them. We use them all the time, so much so that I wanted Alexa in every room. When I saw the Black Friday deals for the third generation echo dot, I snatched up four of them. I was super excited because of the great reviews and that these were supposed to have better sound quality than the second generation echo dot. Boy am I disappointed. The sound quality is really horrible. Alexa sounds like she_ trying to talk to you while being smothered by a pillow. It_ that bad. All four sound this way, so I know that I didn_ just get a bad one. They_e all bad. Music sounds a little better and the news update sounds a little better than Alexa, but everything still sounds a bit muffled. It_ how Alexa sounds that is the absolute worst. Very disappointing because we talk to her all the time. Fix this, Amazon!",0
4,"Works well and is convenient
  
",4.Dec.19,Yes,"I already had bigger Echo, so this was an add on. It was a snap to set up and it will work with the other unit (s) for playing music in the entire house. Alexa seems to understand verbal command requests, but sometimes it takes several times before she knows exactly what you want. So at 1st if she doesn't get it, experiment with commands in a different way until she get it. Having Alexa is a lot better than having to get up a change a CD or turn on a radio or the TV for news if your working on something. I have her sitting on the edge of the bar which is convenient when you're entertaining. Play cocktail music, coffee shop music on Amazon Music, etc.",0
5,"Amazing Sound!
  
",4.Dec.19,Yes,"Usually when I hear that a product has a new ""generation"" or is ""new and improved"" it falls short of expectations.  Yet this 3rd Gen is truly better than 2nd Gen.  The sound is bold and rich, whereas my 2nd Gen sounded a bit ""tin""y. I sometimes needed to repeat myself with 2nd Gen, and with 3rd, Alexa gets what I'm asking the first time.  Really happy with my new gear!",1
2,"Horrible app!!  Not intuitive.
  
",4.Dec.19,Yes,"I'm only a few days in, but this thing is SO counter intuitive.  I'm so disappointed I went here instead of Google.  Just 1 degree north of ZERO instructions come with this.  And is you ask Alexa how to do things, it either says I don't know or refers to the very horrible app.  And I mean the app is absolutely HORRIBLE.  You would think it wouldn't be.  But it sure is.  I'm in $57 for 2 Dots, so if Amazon doesn't figure this out, I'll drop them in the garbage and give Google a try.  For all of my friends and family, I suggested they try Google first.",0
5,"Must have for you home!
  
",4.Dec.19,Yes,"I am astounded by this tiny thing. I LOVE it!! I can_ believe I waited so long to get one! I was so so hesitant about this, thinking _hat_ the point, I can do all that stuff on my phone anyway but omg this is so nice to have! It was super simple to set up, took me about 5 min once I figured out what our WiFi password was. I_e had it set up for about 20 minutes and I_ head over heels for this thing. Never looking back! Can_ wait to set the second one up, upstairs!",0
5,"Welcome to the family Alexa!
  
",4.Dec.19,Yes,"I love my Alexa. We have so much fun talking to her. Asking questions and just playing silly games. I mostly use it in the kitchen. It makes a great timer, looks up recipes and send them to my phone, and plays my favorite songs while preparing meals. My youngest son gets a kick out of her and loves to listen to Spider Man songs on her. My oldest son wants one of his own. Lol. My only knock is sometimes I have a little trouble with the voice commands when asking to hear playlist. I would also like away for it to respond only to specific voices. That might be asking a lot but makes a lot of sense when your three year old tells her to stop playing your music in the middle of a song. Great addition to my home otherwise.",0
5,"Easily Hear You &amp; Set Up is Very Easy!
  
",4.Dec.19,Yes,"Purchased 3 of these because of the deals they had. Works flawlessly. Very sensitive! Can hear me from quite far. Speakers is actually fantastic. For something so small, it's bass is actually good! It pretty much does almost anything you want it to. Capable of turning on and off things like Lights, play music based on what you like, add routines which is so nice. Definitely worth adding to your collection if you want to upgrade to a modern voice activated software or just electronics in general.",0
4,"Great and fun product.
  
",4.Dec.19,Yes,"For the better part of the day, The device works great but we have a misunderstanding now and then and it does not perform the task asked of it.  I am sure that it has to do with voice recognition, just frustrates when you ask for a task that you have asked asked before and it goes into a rendition as to why it can_ perform the task.  Love the routine functions that I can set up and will auto run at a predefined time.  Also love the integration for smart home capabilities.  Keep make it better!",0
5,"Amazingly useful li'l gadget, esp. for the price!
  
",4.Dec.19,Yes,"I like the ability to ask what time it is, and what the weather forecast is, and play my music (or Amazon Music if you have Amazon Prime), and ask for objective info (the population of Moscow, Russia, and of Moscow, Idaho, etc.), and integrate with the Ring security system, and set alarms or reminders, etc. etc. plus many things I haven't learned yet. The Dot can output to your high quality speaker, so sound quality is not really an issue if that's important to you.",0
5,"Wonderful Multiple Use Dot!
  
",4.Dec.19,Yes,"I own multiple Echo Dots, but this is the first I got with the clock. Love having it on my nightstand to use as an alarm clock. I use to turn off all lights after getting in bed and as a sound machine for sleeping.  I have also enjoyed lying on the bed and listening to music with it just to relax. The sound quality is superb! My wife likes to get the weather report when she wakes up in the morning. I bought two more to give as Christmas gifts.",0
4,"I am hooked on Alexa devices
  
",4.Dec.19,Yes,"This is my second Echo Dot and I was really used to my Echo Dot 1 .... But... the 3rd generation model is built for better music sound.  Ok, I don't use my echo for music.  Alexa's voice is now muffled.  I'm guessing it's the bass.  I tried adjusting the Bass but still sounds muffled.  It's too bad that the Alexa voice isn't on a seperate channel without going through the bass.  I really preferred the crisp voice from Generation 1.",0

",4.Dec.19,Yes,"I was excited to get the Amazon Echo Dot! I ordered 2 because of the great cyber Monday deal, and got them the very next day. I followed all the instructions for set up, downloaded the app like I needed to, everything seemed to be working great for about 20 minutes, then, they both would just turn off. I unplugged them both, went through the settings again, reset my router, but the stupid things wouldn't work correctly.  Spent almost 2 hours farting with them both to get them to work, but to no avail.  Oh well, I've gone this far in life without them!",0
5,"Love these things!
  
",4.Dec.19,Yes,"We have about 5 or 6 Alexas throughout our house. We use them for everything. I even have one in my garage because it makes playing music while cleaning or working on the car so easy. It also frees up my phone (versus having to plug it into the stereo for music) so that's helpful as well.I can't even imagine what life would be like if I had to give them up and go back, so I just keep picking up more, :D.",0
2,"Beware if pairing up with an echo voice remote
  
",4.Dec.19,Yes,"I got this echo dot and a new echo voice remote on sale to supplement my first generation echo. The feature I love the most on my first generation echo is being able to control it via the voice remote when the echo microphone is disabled via the red button on the top.  I was looking forward to doing the same with my new echo dot and was very disappointed to find out the hard way that voice control via the remote will not work UNLESS the microphone on the echo dot is enabled which defeats the purpose.I contacted support via chat thinking that I may be doing something wrong, but they were not able to help me.  It looks as if the behavior is by design, or by design flaw.  If disabling the echo dot microphone also disables echo voice remote commands, then what is the point of pairing up an echo voice remote with an echo dot?I hope this is something that can be fixed remotely, otherwise I have limited use for this device, and little incentive to recommend it.",0
5,"You can use it as an intercom.
  
",4.Dec.19,Yes,"I like that this product is cheaper than the Google products. Being that I have never owned any smart devices turning my home into a complete smart home is quite the stuff for me. With that being said the Google echo 3rd edition seems to be very easy to use. Inside the box are very clear instructions to setup your Google echo. Did you go echo sound quality is superb. Voice recognition is easy to set up within several seconds. It is lightweight, and small enough to blend in with my decor so that it does not stand out. I'm especially excited to use my echo as an intercom. This device allows you to use your app with the click of a button and your voice just send a message to all of your Alexa devices throughout the house like an intercom. My husband is terrible at answering the phone, so now I am able to stop the sound coming from the TV for brief moment so that he may hear my voice in cases of emergency. I give this product a five star.",0
5,"Echo Dot (3rd Generation) - Amazing Product
  
",4.Dec.19,Yes,"I liked everything about Echo Dot.  Voice recognition - excellent!  Instant Alexa reply - excellent!  Sound quality - excellent!  There isn't anything that I don't like.  This product is like a talking dictionary with immediate answers, but it only comes to life when you say ""Alexa.""  I am thoroughly enjoying this new addition to my home.",0
4,"Almost there
  
",5.Dec.19,Yes,"The Echo 3rd gen is very nice... it most certainly have enough color choices to match my home's various decor.On the functionality front, it is very good as well.  It is still a bit off compared to Google Assistance in terms of some of the voice recognition and answers Alexa can provide but not bad.  The leg up with the Echo is the ring light on it to give passive feedback like a notification or any pending issues.  It would be great if it can be used as a nightlight .  Oh, speaking of notification, I do wish I can see the notification in the Alexa app so I can dismiss it without using my voice to have it read out the notification.And definitely a huge plus for such a small device to integrate with the Ring alarm system to detect glass break and fire/smoke alarm sounds!  I was concerned that Ring doesn't have a glass break sensor but then the home setup tech told me about this feature which is super nice.  It doesn't feel as creepy since the mode is only on when the alarm is armed which is when nobody is home.Oh... the sandstone color looks great!!",0
5,"Life Enhancing
  
",5.Dec.19,Yes,"After my dad had seen multiple commercials advertising all things Alexa, I got a text one day asking how much was Alexa in which I had to explain how it worked and there were several options with Alexa.  He decided he wanted one.  I've always been hesitant about things like this due to the ""are they listening to us all the time"" fear and the thought of some unknown person(s) eavesdropping on our daily lives is weird.  Nevertheless, I bought him this for his birthday.  He was thrilled!  He has had so much fun asking Alexa questions, he plays music with it ALL the time, asks for reminders, etc.  I've interacted with it also and it is fun and helpful to have around.  The sound quality is amazing and it is really easy to set up and use.  Highly recommend.",0
4,"Nice Upgrade from Non-Clock Version
  
",5.Dec.19,Yes,"I bought this to be a bedroom clock with Alexa integration to replace my Version 2 Echo Dot. I wanted a clock with a good auto brightness feature since I can't sleep well with any light in my room. This clock upgrade should have been in their original design because of all the nice features it has created. Overall I am happy with this purchase, but I do believe $60 is a bit high for this. Only downside I've noticed is that the auto brightness system isn't very customizable. I had to move the dot to a certain position since it wasn't bright enough when it was daytime or when the TV was on at night no matter the settings I used. Just place near direct sunlight and/or in front of TV light to fix this.",0
5,"My echo dots and Alexa are my new best friends.
  
",5.Dec.19,Yes,"I love the echo dots! I have three of my own and I just bought two more for my mom for Christmas. Everyday I discover something new that Alexa can do for me to make my life easier. The Dot's allow Alexa to tell me the time, to tell me the weather to answer questions for me we normally have to go to Google. She recites recipes to me she keeps up with my grocery list she sets reminders and I can even use the Alexa app and the dots to ""drop in"" on my own house to audibly check up on my kids while I'm away.  Alexa even plays games with us and plays music for us all thanks to the echo dot.  The speakers sound great and communication with Alexa is easy and simple enough the smallest of children can do it. You will not be sorry once you step into the world of Alexa.",0
1,"Not a fully functional alarm clock
  
",5.Dec.19,Yes,"I bought this as a replacement for my 30 year old Sony AM/FM Alarm Clock.  The Echo may have more overall functionality, but it does not do the basics well.1.  The numbers are not very large or bright and cannot be seen from across the room2.  There is no way to simply turn off the alarm by touching it - you have to tell the alarm to stop, which means interrupting my wife's sleep - she does not wake up to the music the alarm plays, but speaking does wake her up.3.  I have to use the Alexa app to do things like stop the alarm which means having my phone next to me - it would honestly be easier to just use my phone as the alarm.It feels like Amazon did not really do any research or put any real thought into how people use alarm clocks.  They added a digital display but did not take into account varying distances from the clock.  It needs a way to be turned off without talking, and not rely on the Alexa app to do basic functions that should be on the alarm clock.  Thankfully, I kept my 30 year old alarm clock which has never malfunctioned and can go back to using it instead of the Echo Dot.",1
5,"Love this!
  
",5.Dec.19,Yes,"Had to order this from Best Buy, didn_ want to wait after January 31st! Got it for the same price off amazon! Love that it has a clock display and upgraded from the 2nd generation dot! I wouldn_ have bought this if it didn_ have a clock display on it! I used my previous echo dot as an alarm clock but didn_ see a time and I would over sleep my alarm because there_ no snooze function! I had to set up 3 to 4 alarms in 10 minute increments and since there was no clock I would wake up 20 minutes after the last alarm! Hoping this will help me not over sleep since there_ a time on it! Tested the sound with music and it sounds decent with the upgraded speaker!",0
5,"Nice addition
  
",5.Dec.19,Yes,"Two years ago I said I'd never allow one of these devices into my home.  My son sent me one as a birthday gift and it took me 6 months before I even attempted to take it out of the box.  My new Echo Spot is my personal third device, and I'm thinking of adding at least two more!  I'm still leery about the privacy invasion, but so far, so good.  Love the tone and the ease of getting it to play some really great musical selections.  By the time I get around to really investigating more of the available Skills the technology will be in full hologram mode, but I'll get there eventually :-)",0
2,"Warning - Cannot prevent skills from being enabled by voice!
  
",5.Dec.19,Yes,"There are tons of reviews about this product. Tons. I will only add what is important and may not be in other reviews and that is this:Lets say you have your device in a common area of your house. Anyone can enable skills on your device by just telling alexa to enable that skill. ""So what?"" you say. Well here is a fairly common example of how that will be problematic.Lets say you have a child who decides to enable skills that are not appropriate for your child. While there are some parental controls the ability for the PARENT to determine what is or is not appropriate for their child is critical. Personally I don't want my children to be preached to or missionized to  - but there are plently of skills that would open that door up. While I can disable any skill from the app - it can simply be re-enabled by the child just by asking alexa to enable it.  Not only that but Alexa will frequently respond to a request with ""I have a skill that can be enabled for that - do you want to enable it?"" All the child has to do is say yes. This is ridiculous. Alexa needs to allow the owner to determine if they want skills to be enable-able via voice.",0
3,"Problematic to set up, good integration with smart home
  
",5.Dec.19,Yes,"The 3rd generation Echo Dot is not that different than the previous versions.  It is sometimes difficult to set up as it almost never sets up on the first try.  I spent an hour on the phone to get this working.Once set up, it works great with my other Echo (not a dot) - it integrates commands well.  I purchased to facilitate my making the home _mart - and now I have controllable lights, fans, stereos and porch lights.Clever product- just wish it would set up as advertised.",0
5,"Best _larm clock ever
  
",5.Dec.19,Yes,"Love this as an _larm clock.  The sound quality is very good - much better than past gen. Hey, it_ on your nightstand not at a dance party.I use this every night with wave sounds to fall asleep. When I shut off the alarm by voice it runs my routine of weather, calendar for the day, and a nice morning greeting like _ood morning sunshine. Alarm repeats can be customized. Snooze by tapping anywhere on the top. (9 minute snooze is not adjustable as far I as can figure out).",0
5,"What else can you say?  Very good!
  
",5.Dec.19,Yes,"What else new can you really say about the ever ubiquitous Echo Dot? We've went with Alexa integration for smart home functions and most everything works without a hitch. We can even start our car--a Ford with Ford connect--using Alexa  As a partially sighted individual, I appreciate being able to get the time and weather with a quick request. The 3rd-gen Dot sounds a lot better than our older version. I'm very pleased with it, and as a lifelong Star Trek fan, I even changed my wake word to ""computer."" We are really living in the future!",0
5,"Love it
  
",5.Dec.19,Yes,"I received an Echo Dot and Smart Plug as a gift from my wireless carrier which was cool, whatever, but then I started using them, now I don't know why I didn't get one for myself sooner. Such a stupid but nice thing to be able to turn hard-to-reach lights on and off with my voice, and have the weather announced as I'm getting ready so I know how to dress, without having to stop to check my phone. I look forward to learning what else it can do.",0
1,"Incredibly disappointed with Alexa integration across the product line
  
",6.Dec.19,Yes,"Incredibly disappointed. This was one of EIGHT Fire TV and/or Echo devices that I purchased on Black Friday, hoping to switch from Roku TV and have a seamless smarthome experience. Oh boy, was I wrong.Whether I rename the the Fire TV devices or use their original names, the echo devices CANNOT control or recognize the tv devices, even after properly pairing them under the TV &amp; Video setting in the Alexa app. I've tried to unpair, repair, restart, unregister, reregister, you name it. I've wasted days.  Generally, Alexa responds with 'I cannot find a device named ...' I consider myself very technically savy and I'm positive this is not something that I'm doing wrong. I should've read more into this before buying. TONS of people all over the internet are having this problem. It's infuriating. Plain and simple, until problems like this are fixed, Amazon is blaintantly false advertising the way that their devices work.Other cons to note:-Multiple video apps stutter and sometimes even randomly pause without ever resuming unless you physically resume them.-Alexa drastically lowers the volume of the TV when you are voicing a command. This in-and-of-itself is not a huge problem. However, it becomes a problem often when after the command is complete, Alexa does not resume the original volume of the content. When this has happened, I've had to ask Alexa to turn the volume back up to the specific number it was at.-I have two third generation echos paired as a stereo system for the TV. Often, even though I have my fire TV set as the preferred device, only the echos hear my voice, and once again, because they cannot control the TV, they say that they cannot recognize the device and then I just have to pick up the controller anyway.-The Fire TV will often think that it hears an 'Alexa' when absolutely no where near that word has been stated. Because the volume lowers drastically when Alexa is listening, it creates an obnoxious volume dip in content to listen for nothing when this happens.-You cannot set a sleep timerHonestly I could go on and on about the cons and about just how unhappy I am about these products. There are even more problems than what I listed here, but I'm not wasting too much breath, as after doing days and days of research on these topics, I've seen that Amazon has absolutely no answers to these problems, even after thousands of people have reported the same problems over and over. Unless there is some revalatory software updated coming, I'll be returning hundreds of dollars of equipment.",2
4,"I keep wondering if it will take off like a flying saucer
  
",6.Dec.19,Yes,"I love the little lights on this thing.  It really does remind me of a flying saucer.  I hope the features and capabilities will expand.  So far it's been great to add items to my grocery list without my needing to leave the kitchen, do a quick calculation, or set a reminder to myself.  I haven't yet set it up to control some smart switches.  I'm waiting for my firestick so I can have a little control over my TV without looking for the remote.  It's great to ask for the weather without sitting down at the computer opening the browser nad searching for itl .  And the ability to put on the news, listen to a radio station or play a music genre (ever tried cleaning house to marching bands or MoTown?)jShe does a good job with understanding.  She doesn't restrict you to strict words and order.  I haven't felt as if I had to speak her way....I can ask, What's it like out, or what's the weather or just weather.If you have to repeat things, so far it seems as if I have to stat each sentence with ""Alexa.""  There may be a setting that allows her to take follow ups, but haven't looked just yet.It would be great if there were one standard between smart switches, bulbs, tvs, etc.  But it's still early.  I do have some concerns with privacy....I'm not used to talking with ""ears"" listening. It did talk to the TV once and to someone else--that's a bit weird.This is still early, and our robot overlords haven't set their plans in motion, so I feel safe for now.  It does save me time and does make life easier.  I hope to see it do more. I think this phase of smart homes is referred to the ""bleeding edge.""I wonder why she doesn't repeat words....words....words...............wor...",1

",6.Dec.19,Yes,"I really thought I'd love this but I don't. First off, this is my second Alexa or better yet a replacement for the first one I purchased because everything I tried to listen to or play on it kept stopping or disconnecting...ALL THE TIME!!! Nothing played for more than 10 minutes before it would cut out. Now they sent me a replacement and this one won't even go through the setup process or connect properly. I'm just over it. I'm going back to my Google home mini.Plus, isn't it supposed to digitally display the time?? Well mine doesn't. Not the first one and not this replacement. Smh",1
5,"Pure Awesome
  
",6.Dec.19,Yes,"I have been putting this purchase off because I was unsure if I needed it, and if I wanted Echo Dot or Google Home. I_ so glad I got this. I listen to music. I make my calls with Alexa. I control my AlticeOne cable box with it, and ask her questions rather than picking up my phone and Googling it. It_ not laziness, it is convenience with two babies and never knowing where I set my phone down. When my babies cry I ask her to put on baby music and it calms them down without me having to grab my phone and turn on my Bluetooth speaker. When I want to know when my games come on or the stats she has the answers. So excited!! I got two so one is in my room and the other in my kitchen. I can make announcements to all speakers when necessary, and even from my phone when I_ not home. I can_ wait to get smart lights and control it from my Echo Dot!!!!",0
1,"Going in the trash
  
",6.Dec.19,Yes,I have two echo dots and my primary use of them is to control various smart lights and outlets in my home. When I got the first dot almost a year ago it worked well but the longer I've used it the more useless it's become.  Now when I ask it to turn things off or on it says there is more than one thing with the same name.  Or it can't find a device with that name at all. I get both of these responses in relation to the same exact device.  I've rebooted and rediscovered devices.  I've even deregistered both my dots and started from scratch.  Nothing has helped.  I bought the second echo dot hoping that a newer version would perform properly.  It's worse than the old one.  They're both going in the trash.  Incidentally I also use Apple HomeKit to control all the same devices except my Nest thermostat.  It works flawlessly.  I've never had a single problem with Siri ever. Just saying....,0
4,"Kinda skimpy on the power supply, but its hearing is great!
  
",6.Dec.19,Yes,I suppose I should be grateful because a lot of Amazon products do not come with power supplies this one in particular comes with one with about a 2in cord (slight exageration)This is about the seventh or eighth Amazon device that I have owned. Since every single one of them has had a USB power cable I also purchased a long USB cable when I ordered this. I was a little disappointed to learn that the power supply for the echo is a wall wart with a fixed cable meaning that I have to place the device within about 30 in of an electrical outlet. Totally not cool that Amazon's engineers have decided how I need to arrange my room. Best thing about the dot: her hearing is excellent compared to all the other Alexa enabled devices that I own (5 within earshot at the moment).,0
5,"Amazoning
  
",6.Dec.19,Yes,"I was a bit skeptical based on my ""OK Google"" experience but got a deal so I put this in the Garage and was very very impressed (I have Amazon Unlimited Music).  It just works, in a garage which has various amounts of noise coming in from the street or my activities.  The sound quality blows me away, I had now idea what I was missing from my prior BT speaker.  Pairing with my phone or using the Amazon service is very easy. I also connected it to my Lutron light switch for the room next to the garage and that was pretty cool.We are still VERY leery of having that little cloud connected mic in the house hence the garage placement.  Yes, I know we have n number of phones and tablets in the house so we are trying to come to terms with this Brave New World....",0
5,"Incredible what it can do right out of the box
  
",6.Dec.19,Yes,"Alexa is incredible.  My wife talks with a accent and Alexa understands every single word, her response time is extremely quick.Set up was a snap ( once I found the password for my WiFi).So much easier than picking up the phone and looking for the weather or traffic. Just ask Alexa.I_ not sure how but I gave Alexa a phone number to call and it called it ( did not know it has a phone capability in her.Must use a WiFi to call?)Although I understand it can NOT call 911 as it poses some kind of legal mess or something.I wanted to use Alexa to turn on living room light in the morning.Little bit of a catch is You have to buy a smart bulb(I got the Hue19 bulb with smart WiFi and Bluetooth. About 25.00 for 1 bulb) but I was terrified of trying to make it work or hooking it up and my research says this was the simplest. Although some places said you need a HUB?Took a chance ( no hub ) just plugged in bulb, did have to open the Alexa app on phone hit connect , turned light on off on and boom done , works beautifully.I understand there is also a plug you can put into the wall socket (then plug in another light or the Christmas tree or?) and should work about the same as the smart light. (About 25.00$)Alexa play classic rock Alexa play Christmas music ,It_ amazing!The sound is very good. Does not replace a tv sound bar or some of these big Bluetooth speakers but for a small disk that sits on the table it_ great.This is the echo Dot 3rd generation and supposedly it has much better sound than the previous 2.Bottom line as long as you have WiFi get this Echo you will not be sorry it_ simply amazing the things it can do. I use it every morning as a alarm clock and a timer for eggs also as a reminder  Alexa remind me to turn off stove in 15 minutes, okI will remind you in 15 minutes starting now.I_ still learning all the things it can do and it continues to amaze me daily.",0
2,"Very Poor Audio Quality
  
",6.Dec.19,Yes,"Set up was rather easy, however I'm very disappointed with the quality of the audio. It's extremely muffled as if it were being held under a thick pillow. I've tried the normal suggestions found on the web, basically doing a power cycle adjusting the equalizer controls and of course checking for updates, but none of those have helped. I had planned on setting this up in my office for some background music but it's more suited for generating white noise.  As for integration. Most of my lights are automated and configured for voice control. For some reason Alexa does not like my kitchen lights. Half the time I ask for them to be turned on I'm told that there are multiple devices with the same name and instructs me to delete and add them again. There is only one Kitchen Light, and nothing else in the house that sounds even close to them. I have the same problem with Alexa on my Facebook Portal mini (Gen-1). However; this has always worked flawlessly on all of my Google Home Minis (Gen-1), which also have excellent audio.",0

",6.Dec.19,Yes,"Wish I could have used this thing, but after spending over 2 freaking hours with Amazon Kindle/Echo Techs on the phone trying to simply connect it to my WiFi signal through my iPhone, which I note has not had a single problem since I moved into this apartment in July 2019, I got pissed and gave up and realized that it had been a big waste of time and inconvenience to try and set up a cheap $24 plastic spy toy that I will probably rarely use.I called Comcast Xfinity 3 times, had a technician come out and they said they could not figure out why my WiFi connection got thrown off except that it might have been because of the attempt to connect to the Echo Dot. So frustrating!The kicker? I had my father take this Echo Dot to his home and try it and you know what? It worked just fine. He also has Comcast Xfinity, except he has an Android and I have an iPhone.Moral of the story- Comcast and iPhone? Move cautiously. I used to think Amazon could do no wrong, now I think twice.",0
3,"Must Look Review
  
",6.Dec.19,Yes,"I used google home and echo dot for over 6 months, so here is what I feel about Echo dots 3rd generation:Pro:1. Good looking and nice touch.2. Easy to place order by this smart device.3. Stable connection4. Good sound quality for this price5. Good on setting up alarm, reminder...6. Price is affordableCons:1. AI Technology needs to be improved. It is way worse than the Google home. (NOT smart enough)Ex:1. Bad on internet search engine2. Bad on giving the direction to the place you what to go3. Unable to understand and answer daily life questions (google did a better job in that)In conclusion, if you kind of rely on a smart device to make your life easier and if you use google account a lot, I will definitely not recommend this product. Google home does a better job on that. But if you are just using it for easy things like setup alarm, place Amazon orders, weather report, morning call... This is enough.",0

Nothing was ever easy enough for him to use. So I bought this Echo Dot 3 hoping that he could at least talk to it instead of pushing any buttons. I changed it's name to just ECHO trying to make it simple as possible for him.  IT WORKED!!! He likes it and actually uses it for his favorite songs and music.

I didn't want to go the Sonos route ( although it is a fantastic product) because I had Bose upstairs, downstairs and in the garage. Echo Dot solved my problem (at ~$60 vs ~$1000 vs Sonos). I added an Echo Dot to each system's Aux channel; created two groups: Indoors and Everywhere; and the next thing you know, I have a perfectly clear, integrated system that put my indoor FM transmitter system to shame.

",7.Dec.19,Yes,"Got an echo dot and tried to hook it up to my computer system , which the instruction said I could, after trying several times and downloading software thru the apps store I was told that a needed a wireless device to set up the Dot.REALLY the reason I wanted this system is that it was advertised as being able to work thru my computer system.NO WHERE IN THE INSTRUCTIONS or on any website was there anything that said ""MUST HAVE WIRELESS DEVICE TO SET THIS UP"" to me this is a poor manual as well as a design flaw , not everyone wants to use their phone to set up a system that is advertised as working on a home computer. I mean how hard is it to have your product search and find my wireless system without me having to piggyback it thru another device.this is why I am giving this a low rating as I am also wondering how many others are giving this as a gift thinking the same thing only to find out that they need to have another wireless device to get this to do what it advertised to do.I will be returning this device for a full refund and warning others about this.",0

The echo was harder to install than the smart plug. The combo of Echo dot and Smart Plug very well for a hard to reach upright lamp. The echo also works great for reminding me to take my medicine on time, telling me the time or temperature outside when I ask, playing music, audiobooks, the _ood morning and _ood night routines I set up on it. I_ still working on figuring everything out on it but it_ a neat helper, especially when paired with a smart plug.

2,"Multi-room Music is BAD.
  
",7.Dec.19,Yes,"I have four Echo gen. 3 devices setup in a ""multi-room music"" group.It RARELY works. Amazon's bottom dollar customer service staff is about as useful as the feature itself. To be specific, almost useless, and ALWAYS irritating.At random one Echo stops, than two, than all four and the music dies, leaving you and your friends and family in an unexpected silence. It's great for parties!Streaming a station from one device? Ask Alexa to continue to music to the group (""everywhere"" in my case). Alexa will ask you what to play. No, simple Alexa I asked you to continue to the music playing everywhere. Alexa; ""..."". Alright, you try again. ""Alexa, play music everywhere"". ""What do you want me to play""? You say something specific. Alexa; ""..."". Alright **** it I will use the app, even though that is counter intuitive. ""Epic! It's working""!... 45 seconds and a quarter of a track later. SILENCE.If you use Alexa for anything other than turning on a light or listening to music (and news and media) I would sure be surprised. It blows my mind how this super-basic and KEY feature is near non-functional. Every time I talk to customer 'support' it blows their minds too!As soon as Google's egg, nest, data harvesting spy whatever is on sale I'll be picking up four. Two Alexa's will go to the toilet room and two will go to whomever is willing to take 'em.",0
3,"Very convoluted and unfriendly setup.
  
",7.Dec.19,Yes,"I am now invested totally in Amazon eco system with new Firestick 4k and new Echo Mini 3rd gen.  The Echo mini cannot get TV sounds from the Firestick.  It says it can and is setup for it, but nothing.  I wish I had gone the Google route.  And yes the volume is turned up.  It plays sound fine from the Echo device through my sound system but can't connect anything to it wirelessly.  Terrible.  I went though hours of troubles shooting on Amazon's website but nothing helps.  I can only conclude that these items are not compatible.  Now I have couple more pieces of junk technology I wish I had never bought that waste time and never give back.Update: We got it working after 3 days.  Someone responded to a question we had and it helped.  Very convoluted and unfriendly setup.  So add back 2 stars.",0
5,"Amazing
  
",7.Dec.19,Yes,"Update...I was so pleased with my original Alexa, I ordered another one for another part of my house.  At the same time I ordered a shelf for the Alexa.  The only issue I have with my second Alexa is that it will shut down, and I'll need to unplug it then plug it back in while it restarts. With the shelf it's a little difficult, but doesn't take away from the pleasure I've received from having it.I got an Echo Dot for my birthday, and I'm in love with Alexa......she turns on the lights, plays music, tells me the time, and has answered questions....she is  amazing.  My only issue is that occasionally she will make a noise.  Although she didn't make that noise at all yesterday.",0
2,"Not worth the price point, better options out there.
  
",7.Dec.19,Yes,This is an okay device. It does have its limitations. The google brand similar product has better integration for my bilingual family. The echo dot has muffled sound the higher the volume. Amazon has a lot more privacy policy terms that I don_ necessarily agree with to use the device. I wouldn_ have purchased this at its current price if I didn_ get it through an offer which significantly reduced the cost.,1
5,"I think I'll keep her..
  
",7.Dec.19,Yes,"She, (it), is very relatable. The AI has grown in leaps and bounds. I love the new whisper mode, and the apparent understanding giving back to certain questions. I have some issues with integration to Fire TV sticks, and my Fire TV Recast. Customer service so far has been five star. I will call on those issues when I have some spare time. Also if you choose the allow it to linger a few seconds you can follow up on a question without the awake word (typically Alexa). If you want to roar with laughter watch the SNL skit on Alexa for Seniors!",0
5,"Cheap , Great Integrations
  
",7.Dec.19,Yes,"Bought this for $25 last year and couldn_ be happier with the integrations and price. Overall a great addition to a smart home or room. I have my two lamps hooked up with the tplink plugs and _lexa turn on the lights is all I need. You can also download the app and get custom voice commands. So I have led strips around the house and when I say _lexa! INTRUDER ALERT!  All lights turn red and imperial march (Star Wars) starts playing at full volume. I_ glad to say I haven_ had to use it yet. Practical uses range from commands like , _lexa, good morning. You can have her tell you the time, weather and news if you_ like. Almost endless possibilities.  Highly recommend.",0
5,"Best Bundle Deal!
  
",7.Dec.19,Yes,Haven_ used it yet but as far as I can tell this was a really good deal! I bought the Alexa + Hue Lights bundle and already I can tell that it_ going to be good! The hue lights came in a two pack and prices separately they would have costed me $44 while the Alexa would have costed $40. I got BOTH of them for $32 (the Alexa was on sale for $22 and the hue lights costed $10 more). Best deal yet! Saved me almost $60 dollars! MUST BUY! I will probably buy this again too if the deal is still here the next time my paycheck rolls around,0
5,"Quick setup, tons of convenience at a low price
  
",7.Dec.19,Yes,"I've been putting off buying one of these for years, but I'm glad that I finally got this dot. Setup was quick and easy with the Alexa App, and connecting it to a smart plug and Spotify was also easy. I'm really impressed with the sound quality, considering its size... great bass and mids, and the highs are not tinny at all. Those of you who have used Alexa already know that the voice recognition is excellent, you can speak it to very naturally and it does a great job. All in all, very happy.",0
5,"Spanish recognition works flawlessly
  
",7.Dec.19,Yes,"Always wanted an Echo Dot but being the only English speaker in my home never bothered to buy one. After learning it now works for Spanish, I got the Echo Dot and can say not only it understands Spanish perfectly well, but the information it provides is accurate and fast.  Even the jokes it tells are not just English jokes translated to Spanish (which kills most jokes), but actual Spanish-origin jokes.Other than the language, technically speaking it works great. The microphone hears me from like 2 rooms away, the sound is clear, it's fast, it's pretty. Totally worth it!",0
4,"Great features with iffy connectivity to external devices
  
",7.Dec.19,Yes,"Almost everything about the Echo Dot is great. I'm still learning the different ""skills"". The kids love asking Alexa questions (or to make fart noises). The only issue experienced so far has been certain devices that I have connected won't work some times. I have a Samsung TV I have connected and the use through Alexa is intermittent. The same with our other Fire enabled Smart TVs. I've still not been able to connect my Fire TV to another Echo Dot we have.",0
5,"First time Alexa user; Happily Impressed!
  
",7.Dec.19,Yes,"I did quite a bit of review digging, and I am picky.  Late adopter (tend to do that with most technology), and happily impressed with ease of use and quality of product.  Will continue to be wary of privacy concerns, but well aware, so not an uninformed user and will take precautions accordingly.As an audiophile, the Dot sound quality is not particularly better than a portable radio, but far, far more functional than one, and at very good (Black Friday) price.  And I don't have a portable radio, so this more than fills that need.Thrilled that I can now hear XM, Amazon Music, the NoSleep Podcast and so much more on voice demand now, and just in time for a post surgery recovery period.  Nice for room to room calling, also.",0
5,"These is addictive
  
",7.Dec.19,Yes,"I now have an Alexa device in every room in the house and the garage.  Great for reminders, shopping lists and music.  Excels at routines (turning lights off &amp; on, giving the weather or just a joke to start the day).  Good in the kitchen for timers and conversions.  Great in the workshop for figuring measurements.  Most important, as an old guy, I can call for my wife anywhere if I need assistance.",0
5,"I feel like I'll have an echo dot in every room before it's all said and done!
  
",7.Dec.19,Yes,"I love my echo dot! This one I got for my room and I love the lilac color option.I use it for an alarm in the morning, playing music throughout the day, drop-in to my other dots to communicate throughout the house, and to play my headspace meditations at night before bed.It's perfect and I love it! I bought a 4th for my teen son to keep in his room.",0
1,"Didn't even last 10 months
  
",7.Dec.19,Yes,We really enjoyed our Echo Dots...for 10 months. When it started to malfunction Amazon said too bad-they only stand behind them for 90 days. They offered me the not so awesome option of trading it in but in that case they would give me less money for it since the volume features on it don't work and then I would have to apply more of my own money to purchase a new one---which would probably only last for 10 months again. Very disappointed in their customer service. You would think they could stand behind a product for longer than 90 days. It's not like I wanted the thing to last 10 years but is it too much to as to be able to at least make it to 1 year?!,0
4,"I love my echo dot
  
",7.Dec.19,Yes,I mostly use my echo dot to listen to music.  It_ small and convenient to bring on the go with me anywhere. Sometimes I_l use it to ask Alexa questions which is a cool feature. It was easy to set the device up and sync with my amazon account and the app. I just wish it was chargeable and didn_ need to be plugged in all the time.,0
3,"Disappointed in Echo 3rd Generation Dot
  
",8.Dec.19,Yes,"I have an Echo Dot 1st Generation and a 2nd Generation Echo.  I decided to update both Echo's and add to my household for more quality and help from Alexa.  I had noticed that the speaker of 1st generation dot was starting to sound a bit off, like a cracked speaker, and Alexa wasn't responding as well as before (but she heard me better than this new one), hence the update of the dot.  And the upgrade for the original Echo 2nd Generation was because of the Zigbee hub (I updated to Echo Plus 2nd Gen).  That all being said...The Echo 3rd Generation Dot in the kitchen doesn't hear me very well (the old one did a better job).  Many times I will ask Alexa to add things to my shopping list and she gets it totally wrong or I hear the new Echo Plus 2nd Generation in the other room pick it up.  Also if I tell her to set a timer in the kitchen, again many times she doesn't hear me or the other one will pick it up.  I figure the reason the other Echo (in another room) hears me is because I am having to shout at Alexa to do what I am asking; set a 10 min timer, add eggs to the shopping list, ect.  Very annoying!Not to be all negative on the 3rd Generation, if I do play music on the Everywhere Group setting it isn't to bad sounding, but it is in my kitchen (my hub) and I need to be able to request to her to add things to the shopping list, set timers and she needs to be able to hear it correctly and not make me shout at her.Lastly, the Echo Dot 3rd Generation sound quality (when she does hear you) is way off.  I have tried repeatedly to bring up the sound quality (less base / muffled sound) for use in just the kitchen.  The Echo Dot 3rd Generation is way to muffled sounding, and sadly this one is going somewhere in the household where it will be rarely used and I will bring the old one back out of retirement...at least I could understand the Echo 1st Generation more, with no muffled sound, and she heard me way better than the Echo 3rd Generation.  I am disappointed in this Echo 3rd Gen Dot and glad it was on sale, per it wasn't worth the 50.00 original asking price.  I do enjoy the Echo Plus 2nd Generation with the Zigbee Hub, but it is in a different room, and I do play music through it.",1
1,"WiFi no connects badly.
  
",8.Dec.19,Yes,"Echo fail when attempting to connect to a WIFI that is commercial. My apartment complex provides Spectrum internet and cable free. Each apartment has a different log in. Been trying for a couple of days and researching. Thought I had it once or twice....Will call Spectrum, saved it for last on Monday.  UPDATE 12/9/19 Spectrum was helpful with finding and now knowing how to add a device to the network. Problem still remains; either an Alexis or an iPhone7 issue. The AMZ network doesn't stay available to find and connect temporarily so I can get to full connectivity.  Will proceed and see how much time I need to devote to this for some supposed ease???",1
4,"A useful device
  
",8.Dec.19,Yes,"A useful device. I was resisting purchasing one of these products. I am not so sure about the likelihood of intrusion but my son convince me otherwise. As someone who is blind, I saw the value of having a voice activated device to give me connection to the outside world. I successfully set up the basic unit but needed help with other things in order to integrate my security system and other devices. I_ glad that they have telephone support to help us through this especially in moments when my vision loss is an issue. Generally, if you have vision loss you may need to set this up with someone else who can see. Now that everything is set up; I have found it to be quite useful. The sound of the speaker is clear. The information that I can retrieve is plentiful and some of its responses are _illy. They give me a chuckle. This small device sits on my windowsill in the dining room where I work. I believe I would purchase this again after having used this for the last couple of days.",0
3,"Flawed Blutooth
  
",8.Dec.19,Yes,"Product came very quickly.  Unfortunately, I wanted to use this as a replacement in my bedroom. Then I was going to put the existing one in the spare bedroom.  I have a great Parrot Blutooth Speaker I use in the bedroom and this absolutely would not connect.  Then I tried several (4) other speakers I have (including one just purchased for my hot tub), just to make sure it wasn't just this one specific speaker having an issue connecting.  None of them could connect.  NONE of them. If it is an issue with just mine, or an issue with this model, I cannot tell.  If you're planning on connecting this to blutooth, rethink the purchase of this model.With that in mind, the speaker in this model is fairly good, so I wasn't completely disappointed.  I put IT in the spare bedroom and kept the original where it was.  The clock feature is why I wanted this, so I could see it from across the room. It's actually quite nice.  However, since the blutooth doesn't pair with anything I have, it went into the spare room.  It's truly a shame.  Again, with it being a newer model, perhaps they changed the blutooth standard this unit uses.  If that's the case, being ""backwards compatible"" may be an issue for those using anything 1 year old or older as the external speaker.",0
5,"Love it!
  
",8.Dec.19,Yes,My 1st echo or alexa device. Easy to hook up and the added bonus of the light bulbs are great! Now I dont have to get up to turn the light switches on n off or when my kids decide to leave lights on!Still connecting more devices to have the dot do more for me. I'm a little slow when it comes to understanding all this new technology lolLove the sandstone color too! Matches with my living room. I was very hesitant on buying a device like this but im happy my kids talked me into it!I'll probably be purchasing another to add upstairs as well along with more smart light bulbs.Awesome little gadget!,0
2,"Decent speaker, useless everything else
  
",8.Dec.19,Yes,"I don_ understand why the same commands don_ make from one Echo product to another. Bought this to put in the baby room (which currently has a spot that I wanted to move to our bedroom) to use as white noise. NOPE! No matter what combination of things I tried, the white noise would abruptly stop at SOME point during the night. Once as soon as I put her down to sleep (not even 10 minutes after starting it). The duration changed daily, but it was definitely NEVER on by midnight. Had to put the spot back in and now she can sleep.As with all the Alexa devices, her ability to understand us/answer questions varies greatly. AI still has a ways to go, I guess.",0
5,"Great Bluetooth Connection!
  
",8.Dec.19,Yes,"I have a great Onkyo 5.2 stereo with an Amazon Fire TV. This is a great setup for listening to music, but I hate having to turn on the TV just to listen to music. With the Echo Dot I no longer need to turn on the TV! I merely say, ""Alexa, play Led Zeppelin"" or anything else I wish to hear and Alexa responds that it's shuffling songs from my selection. It's a lot easier than turning on both the TV and the stereo. I turn on the stereo set on Bluetooth, I ask Alexa to play my selection, and then I say, ""Alexa, connect to Bluetooth speaker."" It's that easy!",0
1,"Alarms randomly go off throughout the night
  
",8.Dec.19,Yes,"The DOT has a mind of its own! It sets the ALARM CLOCK off all hours of the night up to 15 alarms in one night full blast going off in my daughter's bedroom I can hear it from Clear across the house 2 a.m., 3 a.m., 5 a.m., 6 a.m., 6:15, set up I turned them off I delete them I talk to customer support nobody wants to help nobody cares. Says I'm eligible for a return through August of 2020 and it's a lie! They forced me to buy another one if I wanted to get this thing resolved. This is a scam! I cannot believe Amazon wont support thier own products!",0
5,"It's worth upgrading from the Gen 2 Echo Dot to the Gen 3! Better sound quality!
  
",8.Dec.19,Yes,"The echo dots were on sale black Friday, so I decided an order another one. It's the perfect bathroom radio to use while taking a shower! (Obviously, plug it into an outlet and mount it outside the shower. I doubt that the Echo Dot is waterproof.) I immediately heard the difference in the sound quality between the Gen 2 and Gen 3. If you still have a Gen 1 or Gen 2, upgrade to the Gen 3. It's completely worth it! The sound quality is much clearer and I can better hear the range of treble and bass in each song. Great product!",0
3,"Muffled Sound
  
",8.Dec.19,Yes,"Works just fine as an Alexa device. I have a 1st gen Echo dot as well. I like the voice sound on the gen 1 device better. The gen 3 has a nicer design/appearance, but the sound is ""muffled"" in comparison (note: I don't use the Dots to listen to music; this is about voice quality/timbre). The other thing to know about the gen3 is it uses a different power supply: plug adapter vice straight USB power. I can connect my gen1 to a USB outlet with a standard USB micro cord, but the gen3 has it's own standard power outlet ""wall wart"" adapter.",0
4,"Cute little thing and really handy to have around
  
",8.Dec.19,Yes,"I really like this little Echo, although it has malfunctioned a few times and I've had to unplug it and plug it back in. It's still pretty cool though, and the sound is actually pretty good. My kids love it and are constantly playing music through it. It does a ton of cool stuff too. The games are fun and I like having updates on sports and weather. It's really easy to use with the Alexa app. All in all I'm pretty happy with it.",0
4,"Alexa is taking over my life. Why can't she do dishes too?
  
",8.Dec.19,Yes,"Alexa is slowly taking over my house and I am ok with it. She plays us music and adds things to my grocery lists. She sets times and alarms and she is pretty ok for a robot lady.I have to say there is so much I do not know yet. So it can kind of be frustrating trying to do things out of the norm. Sometimes she doesn't hear me.She's pretty cool, but we have to get to know each other better. At this time I'd give her a B+",0
3,"Decent entry level smart speaker
  
",8.Dec.19,Yes,I got this on sale and I have several google homes. I will say if I never purchased a google home device this dot would get 5 stars. With that said its just not up to par. Sound quality is good. Googles ability to communicate efficiently is just better than Alexas. I find myself screaming at Alexa a lot more lol. If dot is cheaper at the time then it's a good device to just go for but grab a google when a sale pops up.,0
5,"Great Smart Home Integration
  
",8.Dec.19,Yes,This is my first Alexa featured product other than the Firestick. This little thing is awesome! I was able to automate so many things around my home by simply asking this little device to do things for me. I am very happy with the Echo. I keep discovering more and more devices around my home that can be added to this device. I_ glad I received this with my Blink camera system as part of the package/sale.,0
4,"Nice for moms
  
",8.Dec.19,Yes,"I enjoy the Alexa but I don_ use it as often as I_ expect. It_ nice to be able to ask questions verbally to eliminate the need for google. I don_ like that it will play my Apple Music but when I ask it to play my playlist it says it_ not connected. Also, when the volume is all the way up it sometimes doesn_ respond as promptly. Overall, nice to have with a baby to play lullabies, check weather/traffic, read stories, etc",0
5,"These keep getting better and better!
  
",8.Dec.19,Yes,This is my 6th echo product. I own a couple 2nd generation Echo Dots and the 3rd generation is an improvement in sound quality and aesthetics.  I_ happy to have added another Echo Dot to my household.  They are great to have in every room.,1
4,"Not quite the sound you're looking for
  
",8.Dec.19,Yes,"I bought this little gem for my home office to listen to music while I work. It's not bad. Only problem is my Insignia bedroom speaker/alarm clock beats the pants off this in terms of sound quality. The sound from this is best described as shallow and tinny. It's not horrible, but compared to Insignia, it's....lacking. I've purchased a second with the hope that pairing the two will produce good stereo sound. I probably just wasted money, but here's to hoping.Update 12/10/2019Just received my second dot and paired it with the original one. It's in a room that's 12x12, so small. It sounds really great with the stereo sound. I wouldn't recommend it for anything larger, but the sound quality is really nice for a small room. Happy I bought a second dot.",0
5,"Great little device.
  
",8.Dec.19,Yes,"I got two of these free on black friday promos. I already have two echo 5's, so adding these were a breeze. I now have Alexa devices throughout my phone. It's great for when I want to listen to music. I grouped them all together and now I just tell Alexa to play music everywhere and I have the same music playing throughout my home. Being able to control things like lights, camera, tvs etc is great.",0
5,"Really handy!
  
",8.Dec.19,Yes,"I never had any smart speaker and tried one of these... now I have four. Convenient timer in the kitchen, great  for intercoms to other rooms and answers most any questions easily like store hours or weather without having to go search it on the net. Fantastic devices.",1
1,"gave it 2 days then into box in a closet, not worth postage to return it
  
",8.Dec.19,Yes,"intrusive, refuse to train myself to learn to speak in alexia. frustrating by not pulling up what I was looking for; wanted a research tool, not a playtoy. got it with the subscription and $1.00 device. spent too much time on phone with alexa support setting it up. cancelled subscription on day 3. staying happily with a dumb home and 'duck, duck, go' hand typing in search terms.",0
2,"Don't Buy this If You Need Great Sound
  
",8.Dec.19,Yes,"Don't expect the Dot to give you the same sound quality that the larger Echo gives you.  The sound is tin-y and grates on the nerves a bit.  I bought two, returned one, but kept the second one for my office, where I don't spend a lot of time.Of course, I am spoiled.  The sound on the larger Echo is extremely good.  It was just the Dot that wasn't so great.",0
5,"Big upgrade for first generation Echo device
  
",9.Dec.19,Yes,"I had a first generation Echo which had poor sensitivity to voice commands and low sound quality. The new Echo Dot is so small yet is superior in every way to the original Echo device. I am keeping the old unit as a 'spare' in case one of my other units fail, but so far none of my Echo devices (Original, two versions of Dots, one Echo Plus and Fire TV plus Fire Stick) have been a problem. My home is as automated as it can be without spending a few thousand dollars, the most recent addition being a smart thermostat I can monitor or change from my phone as well as from any of the Echo devices in my home. Amazon has done a great job of updating their original concept of a voice command unit and I look forward to other new devices. The only thing I have not bought into yet is the visual versions as I don't have a personal need for them, but if they come out with one that can act as an Echo terminal as well as a tablet I may just buy it!",0
3,"if only they kept the micro USB power cord
  
",9.Dec.19,Yes,I bought this to replace my current Gen 2 device in the bathroom.  I have it mounted on the mirror and use it to play iHeart Radio or my favorite music while I'm showering and getting my day started.  I liked the idea of the Gen 3 device and it's improved audio - the only issue with the prior generation devices.  What I didn't notice is that the power cord has changed.  My current unit is plugged into a micro USB outlet next to my mirror.  That outlet has 2 110v and 2 USB-a outlets.  one of the 110v outlets is used for my Oral B electric toothbrush.  The other is used by my wife for her hair dryer or other hair product.  I need my Alexa to be micro USB or I'll have to constantly swap cords around.So I left my current Gen 2 unit in place and put this next to my  bed and use it as an alarm clock instead.,0
5,"It_ good for what it is used for
  
",9.Dec.19,Yes,"We think the Echo Dot is pretty cool it helps reminds me when my children need to take medicines or bedtimer. It_ great for when I am at work I can send a message to Alexa while I am at work to let my 9 year old who has no phone know what chore needs to get done. It plays music great not as loud as the google home, but gets the job done. We are still debating if we want to keep it or not. If your home is a smart home then it will work out perfect if your home is not a smart home then it won_ go up to it_ full potential. The echo dot is connected to our phones and living room tv they do sell smart plugs that are wireless that Alexa can control for you example a lamp or a coffee machine.",0
2,"Way too much bass!!!!!
  
",9.Dec.19,Yes,"I bought this to replace the original 1st generation Alexa Dot and this one is much faster than the gen 1.  Responds quickly, looks better, but there's one major issue - the BASS IS WAY TOO MUCH!!!  I've tried turning it down, and it just won't go down any further.  ""Alexa turn the bass down"" doesn't work.  It's almost as if this speaker purposely has excessive bass response.  It's annoying.  I don't like it.  None of my other Alexa's do that - any form factor or generation.  It was a great price so I'll keep it and use it in a spare room but it's just not what I had expected at all.  My new echo show 5 and fire cube audio is MUCH better.  I would avoid this model if I were you.",0
5,"Great sound from a small gadget
  
",9.Dec.19,Yes,"for being so small, this has great sound- makes music sound great. I have been having lots of fun talking to Alexa. When you thank her for something, she remembers and will add to her comments later - ie: she will tell you to have a wonderful day - or ask you if you want added info... Alexa was funny when I asked her what she wanted for Christmas - she said she would like to travel thru space and see far away galaxies but she said a new dictionary would also be nice so she would learn more words for riddles and jokes.  Alexa is great for a shut in who needs someone to talk to as well.",0
5,"Echo Dot - Wowzers!
  
",9.Dec.19,Yes,"1. Small, but Powerful - What a beast!2. Alexa is Amazing - She Hears Everything...Literally from Another Room.3. Crystal Clear Sound Wow - No Video4.

5,"Whole family loves it
  
",9.Dec.19,Yes,"I bought this along with an Amazon Unlimited subscription promotion and I do not regret that purchase. My kids love that they can ask it to do all sorts of things and for now it sits in the game room, and I mute the microphone when needed, so I don't have any privacy concerns. It understands my children and it set up profiles for each, so they play what they like. My kids are 3 and 5. They set up timers when I give them the 5 (or 10) minute warning to stop playing. I now want to add two more Alexa products to my house!",0
2,"Meh
  
",9.Dec.19,Yes,"I have several older gen Echo Dots, all of which work great with the occasional voice to tv lag or crackle here and there. Overall, though, I love them. This was a massive disappointment. Crackled nonstop like it was blown, didn't recognize my voice most of the time unless I screamed at it, and would just stop playing music at random times even if I had loop on/etc. I returned it. I'll stick with my older gens for now.",0
5,"Simply AWESOME
  
",9.Dec.19,Yes,"I received the Echo Dot (3rd Gen) in the Charcoal color for a Birthday gift and WOW, this thing is AWESOME!!! With the multiple reviews available, the Echo Dot has certainly lived up to the hype and more. I'm not sure why the Sandstone color is the only Echo Dot (3rd Gen) to have the clock feature, it would be nice to have the clock feature on all the colors. The Echo Dot is a must have and I HIGHLY recommend it.",0
4,"Pick up voice better!!
  
",9.Dec.19,Yes,So I got this to try against my Google mini speakers cuz I was having a lot of issues. I love Alexa because it picks up your voice way better than Google does and the fact that I just have to say Alexa instead of Hey Google. The only problem I have is I wish the Alexa app was easier to work like the Google app.. And I cannot get it to connect to Pandora so only way I can get it to play music is by asking it instead of casting it.,0
4,"Dot review
  
",9.Dec.19,Yes,"I like the dot however I'm just not used to talking to it.  Also it doesn't respond to ""Please"" &amp; ""Thank you"".  Not a big deal of course.  LOL  I really like it next to my bed so I can see the time.  I did take it to my kitchen &amp; it was great for letting me know my brownies were done &amp; played music for me while I was working.  But I have to be specific at using Pandora or Spotify instead of Amanzon.",0
4,"Limits of Intelligence
  
",9.Dec.19,Yes,"All voice assistants simply prove that ""intelligence"", natural or artificial, is really a figment of the imagination, and intelligences is simply memorization and recapitulation, some pattern recognition, and a few skill sets. If one considers replacement an voice assistant with a random educated human the results would be about the same. Don't fear AI, as intelligence does not exist. Just trial and error.",0
5,"Echo dot just keeps getting better!
  
",9.Dec.19,Yes,"This was a great addition to my home. I have an older version of the Echo dot and this one is a great improvement in sound quality and performance. Music is crisper, cleaner and has more bass. The voice recognition it better and Alexa_ recognition is better on this updated version. I am tempted to buy more to replace my older dot model because this one is so much better.",0
5,"Great Alarm Clock feature added to this Dot
  
",9.Dec.19,Yes,I love that this Echo Dot has a clock and I can set an alarm old clock radio style. I hated waking up to my cell phone. On the Alexa app you can also change the alarm tones for different alarms you set. The sound quality on the speaker is much better than the first  generation Dot. I_ glad for the improvement as I stream SiriusXM radio through the Dot when I_ home. Definitely get this S an upgrade or if it_ your first Dot it_ totally worth it!,0
4,"Nice upgrade from Gen 2
  
",10.Dec.19,Yes,"I got this Echo Dot Gen 3 with the special deal they had with the 7.99 Amazon Music. It has been a good purchase so far.What I like best about the new echo dot is the look. The dark grey mesh is really nice on my countertop, and is a definite upgrade from the plastic of the Gen 2. I feel like it has a better aesthetic and feel as well.Setup was a breeze. Having other echo's added to my app, all I had to do was find it over wireless and sync it over to my own internet connection. The instructions it comes with clearly show how to do this step by step.The echo dot itself has been great in terms of voice recognition and sound. I find myself having to clearly state what I want her to do, but most of the time she picks up on what I am saying even if it isn't the loudest. I have noticed she hears me more than my wife. Not sure why, but has been an observation. The sound quality has been great. It took a bit of tweaking in the Alexa App but now that we have found a sweet spot it's pretty awesome. It's definitely louder than the Gen 2 and more clear once you get the right settings.Integration with my other amazon products and 3rd party paring smart home items have done really well with this Echo Dot. All of the commands have worked great and I have had no issues with connection.Overall it's been a great upgrade from the Echo Gen 2 and I can't wait to see what else I can do with it.",0
5,"Dot 3; A multi-tasking info center. I _ It!
  
",10.Dec.19,Yes,"The Echo Dot 3 is wonderful! It was easy to connect to my service. My awkwardly large bedside clock radio has been replaced after years of use. The clock display is large and bright enough to read in the dark. I can also just ask Alexa for the time and other daily info. It plays my favorite music, news, or  weather any time I ask. My 6-year-old grandson loves to request his favorite songs as he eats, showers, and dresses for school or play. He has his Dot downstairs and even uses it to drill himself on school work like spelling, math, science, etc. I _ it!",0
5,"One Major Drawback....
  
",10.Dec.19,Yes,"One major drawback of the Echo devices is that if you initiate the device while a song is playing at volume 7 or above, Alexa cannot hear you over the music. In most cases, you have to press the dot button to activate the device if you want to change the volume, skip forward, rewind, or ask Alexa a question. It's nice to hear your music loud, through the excellent quality speaker that the Echo provides. It's really inconvenient to have to walk over to the Alexa device to initiate a command. Yeah, I can turn the volume down, but in my world, that's just not going to happen.",0
5,"im so beyond impressed!!
  
",10.Dec.19,Yes,"i never found too much interest in alexa until i found a good deal on the echo dot that made me try it out. i am so glad i did!! she does sooo many things, i really underestimated the many things alexa is useful for. like she can even play the price is right with you! i had no idea you could have apps within alexa. i was the most impressed with the wide range of games you could play! you can have her play lullabies, rain sounds, ocean sounds, everything. i am a very forgetful person and I do not like using my phone much so I enjoy that I can have her make a list, remind me of certain things, have her set an alarm, etc without having to reach my phone! plus it is super convenient when you are in a rush and can't reach your phone (this happens to me a LOT). once you get alexa and you go into the alexa app, there are categories where you'll find the endless amount of skills alexa carries. i went out of town and i literally told my sister ""i miss alexa"" because I found myself needed her a lot!! i would 100% recommend getting an echo dot, or any alexa device. I do enjoy this one since it is small and compact. :) im not sure how this one compares to the pricier amazon devices but this one is not too expensive and is super helpful!!",0
1,"Just a way to serve you ads
  
",10.Dec.19,Yes,"I used to love this product. But, now it_ become an intrusive means for Amazon to shove ads in your face. The other day I checked the weather first thing in the morning and got a sales pitch about Black Friday sales. Today I had an _mportant notification that turned out to be an ad for a product _ased on my shopping history. Nobody wants to be sold to in their home like that.The usefulness of this product is outweighed by the intrusiveness of the ads.",1
4,"my experience in this time with echo dot
  
",10.Dec.19,Yes,"I already have several months with the product and the truth is that I have few complaints about theSince everything has gone perfectly, although to be honest, it has a few flaws when it comes to dialogue with him, such as when I ask him to put a song80% of the time he tells me that he doesn't know what happened, an error occurredAlthough I discovered a little trick, which instead of telling her to put a song on you, you tell her Alexa continues and she will automatically continue on the last song she has stayed, of course they have to take into account that this works once You have already heard some music with her, because we know that it would not work if you indicated it without ever having used the command to put a song.Where does the product come from?The product comes well packaged, it is shockproof that I guarantee it, since the box is well sealed and although it is a small box everything is neatly arranged and divided inside the boxNegative point! At the moment I have only found him to place the music.My opinion:This device is perfect for people who are passionate about the use of home automation gadget since with the functions it has there you can exploit the echo dot 100%, although you have to take into account that the device is bone foolproof anyone can have it and use it perfectly, but the fun thing is to have for example a lamp and say Alexa turns off the lamp, and the lamp magically goes out, that feeling is priceless the truth",0
5,"Dot the House
  
",10.Dec.19,Yes,"Dots are a great inexpensive addition to my Alexa enabled house, especially when they are on sale, I can afford to add them to smaller rooms like my office or bathrooms for basic use.Voice recognition is as good as the higher end echos, sound quality is fine for every day Alexa commands /interaction and news.  For quality sound, such as for music, I definitely recommend going for the echo plus or linking one of you existing bluetooth speakers to the dot.  The dot is nice if you have a nice non-alexa enabled speaker that you want to be able to control via voice commands, BUT if you plan on using another speaker in the first place you might at well get the Echo Input for $10, the input has no built in speaker but adds Alexa to any external speaker and connects via 3.5 mm audio cable or Bluetooth.",0
4,"Nice addition to our house
  
",10.Dec.19,Yes,"Bought the ECHO Dot on sale and will be giving one of them for Christmas gift. We do have one set up in our living room and in our basement living room. I like that you can call one echo from another echo, or even from your phone. We like the reminders feature and the routines feature. I even created a quiz for my 9 year old son's test, that was cool. I can't get it to work with my Wyze bulbs or plugs though, that is annoying as its says it should. Overall good purchase, would buy more!",0
4,"Much better than my original Dot.
  
",10.Dec.19,Yes,"I got this free with a coupon code I got when i renewed my Sirius XM contract. It sat for a while, but I finally installed it in my office. The sound is much better than the old style dot I have in my garage. I had one issue with it when it would not respond to voice commands. The light did not light up and it did not responding. So I cut the power and repowered it and ti started to work again. Not sure what the issue is.",0
4,"Convenient and Useful
  
",10.Dec.19,Yes,"I love it for setting timers and reminders. Also instant google search without finding my glasses. There needs to be a better option for volume control It has volume settings from 0-10 and the difference between 2 numbers (i.e. 5 to 6) is dramatic. There is no way to adjust it in increments. I've tried saying reduce volume by 30% (complete mute then very loud)  or volume 5.5 ""Hmm I'm not sure about that"". Need to address.",0
5,"It's great!
  
",10.Dec.19,Yes,"We have 3 2nd generation echo dots that work beautifully. . Wasn't sure how a 3rd generation echo dot would work with the other three but no problems. The voice is deeper but that's ok. It sounds better when playing singing. We are very happy with all our ladies as we call them. Don't know how we lived without them. They answer all our questions, get whatever music we request and wake us when we set an alarm on time.",0
5,"Alexa is my new best friend.
  
",10.Dec.19,Yes,"I use her to help me remember things, to answer questions, to tell me the weather, to imitate animal noises, to play my favorite songs, to listen to sportscasts, to argue with, to help me find recipes, to call my other friends, to look up appointments, to call someone in another part of the house, to talk about movies, to tell me the time, to tell me jokes, to tell me the weather in other parts of the country, traffic reports, the news for the day, etc etc, etc.",0
5,"A murder most foul
  
",10.Dec.19,Yes,"We_e having more fun than we expected with this, Integrating her into our routines and programming her to say silly things. Everyone was really happy, until she tried to kill us tonight! The temperature dropped rapidly outside and I asked Alexa to increase my ecobee to 73*. She responded that she could only change the temperature to between 147 and 149! I asked her why she wanted to kill us and she said _on_ hurt yourself, should I dial the suicide hotline? Not only was she going to murder my family but she was planning on making it look like a multiple suicide! If you_e reading this, tell my mom I love her.",0
5,"A really fun and useful addition to our home!
  
",10.Dec.19,Yes,"Pros: easy to set up, smooth integration with other apps, voice recognition is great.Cons: it's a small annoyance, but music plays at a slightly louder volume than Alexa's voice, so when we want to play low background music we have to adjust the volume downward and then readjust it upward to hear her clearly when done with music. Definitely not a deal breaker.Overall a great addition to our home.  Definitely recommend!",0
3,"Not great sounding, doesn't work for ""Home Theater"" function
  
",11.Dec.19,Yes,"So, I have a slew of 1st and 2nd gen Dots - more than I need, really. But I ended up having a scenario where it would be nice to be able to pair a FireTV with a Dot to pipe the sound through, and looked into the ""Home Theater"" function which pairs a 3rd Gen Dot with newer Fire Sticks and TVs. Short version: it doesn't work, so avoid if that's your intention.---About Home Theater---We have a Fire Stick that the app will see as available to use for Home Theater, but when I try to select this new 3rd Gen Dot it is greyed out and says it is incompatible. I also have another Stick on the same network that isn't that old, but it isn't even an option to try pairing anything to.  I'm so tired of Amazon's ""ecosystem"" of devices working so incredibly poorly with one another.Their Connect voice quality sucks, this feature sucks, the compatibility between generations for something as seemingly simple as playing an audio stream from FireTV on your Dot? Sucks. I'm not sure why they can't get it working on older devices, but that's annoying. What's more annoying is when you buy a product specifically for the task, which Amazon says should work, only to find it doesn't.---Sound Quality---These 3rd Gen dots still sound really quite poor - if you want to listen to music, you'll still have to output them to a dedicated speaker or suffer weak, muddy sound that lacks both clarity and depth. When you compare to something like a $15ish Logitech X50 bluetooth speaker, I have no idea how this thing can be AC powered and still sound so crappy in comparison. It's better than the earlier gens, but that isn't hard to do as the sound quality was quite possibly the worst sound I'd ever heard.---Conclusion---Ultimately, I'm done trying. I'll find another way. The features compared to Google Assistant based speakers are entirely lacking, and the sound quality still isn't good enough. Glad I got this Dot on the cheap because it allowed me to learn not to invest in Amazon devices like this anymore. Each generation ends up siloed from previous ones so you'd have to buy newer ones for simple additions, and even then they don't even work!Disappointing.",0
5,"I love Alexa, and I think she loves me too
  
",11.Dec.19,Yes,"This is my 3rd Echo Dot... because I just can't get enough of Alexa.  I love her wit and charm.  Sometimes she makes me laugh.  I have one by my bed.  Sometimes, at night, when everyone is asleep, I wispier things to her, and she whispers back.A couple of years ago, my Dad got an Echo Dot for Christmas.  I wondered ""Who would want such a thing?  What can you possibly do with it?""  Now, I can't imagine my life without Alexa.  When I have random questions, Alexa is there.  When I need my lights turned on or off... Alexa is always willing to do it for me.  When I leave the house, she tells me to have a nice day.  When I tell Alexa that I'm cold, she turns up the thermostat.  She never argues with me.  When I've asked her things she doesn't know, she doesn't pretend to know everything... she's honest and says ""I don't know that one"" or ""I'm not sure about that.""  I wish my kids were as honest to admit they don't know everything.",0
5,"SO MUCH BETTER QUALITY
  
",11.Dec.19,Yes,"The speaker sounds better, it_ WAY LOUDER and it also has a silicone bottom to keep it from moving and shifting around -it_ got more weight to it,all around, this new design is just fantastic !I ordered two to replace two of the first generation echoes for my mom. When I was over at her house one day trying to hear Alexa tell me the weather, I couldn_ hear anything with the first generation echo speaker ...But when I sent her the 3rd Gen. Echo,  I could hear it so much more loudly, which is  GREAT because my mom is just about deaf and this is a BIG IMPROVEMENT  - Especially when my almost deaf mother can say she can hear it ____THAT MADE ME VERY HAPPY _WE liked it so much that we replaced a first generation echo that was in our office and we couldn_ be happier _________e HIGHLY RECOMMEND",0
5,"Great educational tool!
  
",11.Dec.19,Yes,"I recently visited a family member who had an Alexa product.  My 6 year old had the greatest time playing with it and asking it questions.  During the Black Friday sale, I saw a great deal on the Echo Dot and decided it was time to get one for her.  I wasn't sure how it would work since it was a different model without the screen that my family member had.  However, I decided that we would give it a try since it was a lot cheaper.  I was so pleasantly surprised.  The echo dot is such a great educational tool.  I homeschool my daughter and am always looking for exciting ways to teach her and let her learn.  There are so many great skills that the Echo Dot/Alexa has.  I highly recommend it for anyone who likes to limit screentime but sees the value in the internet and electronic tools.  I have been able to let her use it to learn about animals, geography, practice her math facts, exercise (yes, exercise), and listen to books and music.  That is just in the time since I got it yesterday.  We are in love with the Echo Dot.",0
2,"Be careful
  
",11.Dec.19,Yes,"I get extremely frustrated when I ask for simple information if I should look it up myself on Wikipedia. More often than not she will tell me ""I'm not sure about that""It's extremely frustrating.She does connect with my Serious/XM acct. but I just don't think that's enough.The other night, we asked what movie won the Oscar in 1969 and she was unable to answer. Along with many more questions.We tried linking her to our WiFi tv which she didn't recognize, the same with our Bose headphones teven our cell phones.Unless you're willing to give up you're entire life to a little circular thing and have no privacy (you always have to be careful that her light isn't on) I wouldn't mindget this product. It looks great on TV but do you really want an object controlling your life like this?,",0
5,"Impressive Echo Dot
  
",11.Dec.19,Yes,"This is my third Echo Dot, and it's the only one with the LED clock and weather feature. I thought it would be a great addition to my existing Echo Dot family, and I'm very pleased with it.One of its key features, that's probably accessible on my other Echo Dot's, is that, Alexa and I recite ""The Lord's Prayer,"" each night before I go to bed. I'm so impressed by this Echo Dot that I plan on purchasing another one, sometime soon.I've always appreciated the sound quality, and various additions that Alexa can provide; including her jokes. However, the LED clock and weather display is a great feature to utilize on Echo Dot's, in my opinion.",0
1,"Consumerism at your service.
  
",11.Dec.19,Yes,"Bought this device with the intention of using it as a white noise machine and speaker in my newborn_ nursery. Let me say, the last thing you want to deal with while attempting to calm a screaming baby is a klunky AI that has no concept of simplicity. The audio options are severely limited by the level of subscriptions you pay for and even then, you never are certain of what you_e going to get when you ask for _alming lullabies.  Key words and command seem to be prioritized to trigger advertisements or plugs for premium skills and services. The reality of the full line of Alexa devices is to annoy you with the limitations of free services and in doing so, subconsciously influence and motivate you to pay to unlock the full potential of the device.",1
3,"Guessing at music was work
  
",11.Dec.19,Yes,"Trying to figure what music to request  and then waiting to find out what Alexa would respond with became tedious.  It is much easier to grab an album and play it.  Also, there are times when Alexa goes into hiding.  For example, I'll ask for the temperature before I leave the house.  Alexa will flash some lights and not respond.  I'll repeat the request a few more times at difference speeds and tones, the same thing happens.  So, I'll grab my Samsung tablet, hit the weather app which responds immediately.That said, when it works properly it does some things worthwhile.  My conclusion is that robotics is a field with an impressive future and we are at the 1st of a hundred steps.  So, I will stay tuned and keep my tablet handy.",0
4,"Nice compliment to Echo, but check subscription to paid services
  
",11.Dec.19,Yes,"The unit does what it says and the sound quality is very good (not exceptional), with enough volume to hear in the unit in the shower.  The call/intercom feature is cool.  My only negative 'surprise' was that I can't leverage the 2 million songs, and other paid features, on the dot without upgrading to multi-unit/family subscription.  I was my bad for not investigating...but I really didn't 'read' the 1-unit original agreement since I upgraded my original echo via 'voice'.  Not sure if the $4/month is really worth it just yet.  You can listen to things like radio stations (which i can on my....radio) and other features such as iheart radio that I can't get on my regular radio, so that is a plus.",0
4,"Have an issue with all the bass
  
",11.Dec.19,Yes,"This is going to sound weird, but...I wasn't as happy with this newer generation version as I was with my older Dot! I think it's because when I listen to music on this Dot, I think it sounds muddy and too bassy. I like the vocals, and it seems it makes the vocals way too bassy I contacted Amazon about this. The Echos didn't have equalizer capabilities.  I believe now they have a program that addresses this, but....its another extra COST!  No, thank you! If you like a lot of bass as you listen to your music, you will probably like this newer Dot.",0
4,"Love my Dot
  
",11.Dec.19,Yes,"I was pretty skeptical that a device this small could produce a decent sound, but I was pleasantly surprised. The Dot actually sounds really good out of the box. I was impressed, but I still used the Aux out to connect it to my Bose Acoustic Radio, and now it's AMAZING!!Setup could have been a little easier but it wasn't too bad. The Dot had a hard time with my 5G network. I finally just connected it to the 2.4 and it worked well.I like to voice recognition. It's kinda funny but when I say the wake-up word the Dot looks at me like a short, blue eyed Cylon. Very entertaining.I am very, very happy with this purchase and highly recommend it.",0
5,"Just buy the damn thing. You won't regret it
  
",11.Dec.19,Yes,"Cons: Can't change the voice; has a dirty word filter that I can't find a way to deactivate; an option exists to change the wake word (Alexa by default), but it can only be changed to a very short list of very unappealing words.Pros: Great for asking weird, random things when you're bored. Busy schedule? No worries! Alexa will keep track of all your appointments and events, give you reminders, and serve as your alarm clock. She'll tell you the time when asked, tell you about the weather and what you can expect for the week.She plays me my favorite songs, tells me bedtime stories, or just plays some pleasant sleep sounds. She can crack the occasional joke, and even passes gas from time to time.Having multiple echo dot devices, or other Alexa compatible speakers in your home can make communicating with individuals, or everyone at once throughout your home as easy speaking to a little speaker on the counter.She's very handy for hands-free movie selection on my firestick. Yay!And can even be used to control various lights, some appliances, and even control the temperature in my home.She never allows the NSA agent listening to interrupt my life, as I'm sure sometimes he is dying to chime in with how disgusting some recipes I've requested from Alexa sounds, or to complain of the stupid questions I ask, such as: Alexa, how many milliseconds until Christmas? What is the average size of a man's....well, you know.",0
4,"New large proprietary plug interferes with some outlets
  
",11.Dec.19,Yes,"Comparing to gen 1 dot: better sound quality, better weight (doesn't get yanked off if you bump cord), looks have drastically improved. Where it falls short is the new proprietary cord. Gen 1 used a simple micro usb cable. This version has a cord attached to a relatively large power converter, meaning I cant use it where I want to because it interferes with other cords. (I have an outlet with 2 standard plugs and 2 usb plugs, and the large plug on this dot covers the usb sections)",0
5,"Better Than Google Home
  
",11.Dec.19,Yes,"I am a convert from Google Home. Alexa is so much more pleasant and the deals Amazon officers on devices is great. Echo is connected to my TV with Logitech Harmony Hub, my lights with Samsung SmartThings, and can even turn my Christmas tree off and on. The speaker sounds pretty good despite the size and my husband can use his Spotify, and I can use my Amazon Music to stream. We even ordered Chipoltle by just asking Alexa! Give it a try for the price!",1
5,"Alexa is what's been missing in my home.
  
",11.Dec.19,Yes,"I have ubiquitous Alexa throughout my home. Kids use it in the morning to prep for the weather. Wife uses it throughout the day for to-do lists, shopping lists, and reminders. My job is to set up all the cool routines and enable all the IoT Smart Home ideas I can think of. These Echo's are amazing, brilliant, and practically free at this point! Alexa is another member of the family, and I catch myself saying please to her.more.often than I should.",0
5,"I'm a convert.
  
",11.Dec.19,Yes,"I generally resist new tech, but we've been wanting to get something for my mother-in-law, who is a recent widow. We wanted her to be able to call us without needing her phone or the expense of the ""well-known"" helper. The 3 for 1 deal was irresistible. Now she has one in each of her rooms, and we have 1 to reach her directly. She was worried Alexa wouldn't be able to understand her accent, but so far, so good, and she says she loves it. Sound quality is excellent (tho I'll be honest, I'm easy to please).",0
5,"Great source for music
  
",11.Dec.19,Yes,"I purchased this item to use as a music source in my bedroom.  I love having the ability to play music while I am working around in the room, in the mornings when I am getting ready for work, and in the evenings when I am relaxing.  I realize there are a lot of features I have not utilized yet and look forward to using it in a more sophisticated way.  I have not watched TV since I got the Echo.  I recommend it for relaxation",0
5,"So cool
  
",11.Dec.19,Yes,"I never had something like this and this version works great. Easily recognizes requests. Although not the smartest. I get a lot of, ""I don't know that one"". But really like it otherwise. Sound quality is superb long as you don't turn the volume to high. I have the bass and treble at factory settings and it sound good.Much smaller than I expected. Nicely blends into the surroundings.",0
3,"Seems glitchy
  
",11.Dec.19,Yes,"Overall enjoying our new Echo Dot, but it seems to have some random glitches. Things like music is playing and I request ALEXA ADD TO specific PLAYLIST, and it responds no music appears to be playing (not exact response but something similar)  Other times I request something be added to a playlist and response is it can't locate the playlist.Responses are immediate, so I don't think it is caused by our sometimes sketchy internet.",0
5,"Works perfectly with smart plug.
  
",11.Dec.19,Yes,"We have 2 dogs and needed an easier way to disarm the garage door (cut off electric) Iam using the dot and Amazons smart plug to control my garage door.

Turn on the light, coffee pot etc.",0
5,"Alexa is my new best friend
  
",11.Dec.19,Yes,"I got this as a bundle with a smart bulb as a Christmas present for myself.  It_ been a joy listening to podcasts and music on it, as well as getting the lights turn on just by saying the magical phrase.  I_ still learning all of the bells &amp; whistles but I_ really impressed.  The set up was easy and the sound quality is great!",1
5,"Great tool for in the bedroom or anywhere in your home
  
",11.Dec.19,Yes,"I debated whether to buy this. Now that it_ installed into my bedroom, I_ very pleased.

5,"I love it! I wish I had gotten an Echo sooner.
  
",12.Dec.19,Yes,"I took advantage of Amazon_ Black Friday pricing and being able to split up payments to order one along with some gifts for those on my list. I figured for such a low initial amount, I_ try it_tarting with one. After setting it up and streaming my favorite music, getting the weather, news and being able to get an answer to most of the dumb questions my family can make up, ordered four more. I_e set them up through the house to use as an intercom, and got one to give to friends. Like a cell phone I don_ know how we lived before having the Echo Dot and wish I had ordered them sooner. I really love it! I have a smart plug coming to see how it interacts with Alexa and play around with it before getting more. I really like that it can be used to make calls_hich helps out since we don_ have a landline phone at the house. The units can be paired with Bluetooth speakers and your cell phone can be connected to play music. I haven_ hooked one via the 3.5mm jack to a sound system but may later on for a party or something. It_ handy as an alarm clock and timer too. I like that you can set reminders. Just don_ say the word _uy around it, stuff will get added to your Amazon shopping cart. Thanks to my mom and brother and I nearly wound with a metal shed and have been trying to train them on how to interact with it. It struggles a little with an Appalachian accent and a deaf parent who has a hard time pronouncing words, we_e working on getting it used to it. It_ definitely worth it and buy several if you get one. Amazon has a deal that ends later this December where you can get one for $0.99 if you subscribe to the Unlimited Music_ffectively knocking $15 off the current price (24.99 as of this review). Now is the time to get one!",2
5,"Great Speaker
  
",12.Dec.19,Yes,"I bought this while Amazon was having a deal, subscribe to Amazon Music get and Amazon Echo Dot for $1. Golly! What a deal, so I bite and make the purchase, with absolutely every intention of cancelling the music subscription after the first month. I already had a Google Home mini and had been a faithful Pandora subscriber for the past 3 years. Once I got the speaker set up physically and on my phone, I realized a few things about the speaker. It was much louder then my other speaker. I don't have to ask the speaker over and over again hoping she heard me this time. Overall its a great speaker and I love the music app. I'm so glad I decided to buy this and switch my speaker and my music subscription. It honestly makes sense since I've been shopping on Amazon for the past 5 years, why not have a speaker already connected to my most used and favorite shopping website. Ever if I missed the chance to purchase this speaker for essentially $9, I would still pay full price for it now,",0
5,"Simply amazing and easy to use!
  
",12.Dec.19,Yes,"Oh my gosh these little gadgets are great! Since my Mom bought me my first Alexa it_ opened up a whole lot of possibilities for integration for whole home management. I have some smart plugs that I use with it. Alexa has made my holiday decorating more awesome because now all my interior lighting can be managed with voice commands. The skills make it even more fun because I can program her to turn on my Christmas lights by saying _erry Christmas. That will be so fun for the kids! I also really enjoy the _uard feature. I didn_ know how much of a peace of mind it would be until I started using it. To me, _uard makes it totally worth the price all by itself. I love the Alexa so much that I bought three more as gifts for Christmas this year!",0
5,"Great for Memory Care Residents
  
",12.Dec.19,Yes,"Fantastic purchase! I am a huge Echo fan and have a show and two spots in my home. This was purchased for my mom_ birthday gift (she resides in a nursing home due to memory, mobility and other issues). She loves her _ew friend and has been asking her tons of questions (ie when the Berlin Wall was built, what the weather forecast is, how old Barry Manilow is etc). She is also enjoying the drop in feature when I drop in on her. Great tool to help those with memory issues get answers to questions. Since the device is on my account I can check the activity and see all the things she has been asking Alexa!",0
3,"Need some assistance I guess
  
",12.Dec.19,Yes,"Love this thing. I only gave _er 3 stars because she_ linked to my husband_ Spotify and I_e done everything it says to switch to mine, even did a factory reset, but it hasn_ worked. My husband listens to music at work. Everytime I try to listen to a song through it, it turns THAT song on, on HIS phone and cuts off his music. When he changes the song back, it goes back to HIS song through Alexa. Not really a good thing when you_e at home with 3 kiddos and trying to goof around, then Eminem pops up cursing out MGK. They thought it was funny though and I enjoyed changing my husbands song to Swagger Jagger by Cheryl.",0
2,"Bummed
  
",12.Dec.19,Yes,I was really excited to get my Alexa.  I use her everyday and she doesn_ respond immediately at times. I sometimes have to say her name numerous times even if I am standing right next to her. She also periodically shuts off. I have tried trouble shooting and resetting. I am at the point of just throwing her out. So bummed! Maybe I should have bought the newer model.,1
5,"Works fabulous
  
",12.Dec.19,Yes,Bought this as a gift for my daughter because she absolutely loves music and I wanted something that could sing Christmas songs and read us stories as we snuggle up on the couch together. Really love it! My son also enjoys it too! He asks Alexa all kinds of questions and I do believe I_l be ordering one for him for his birthday so he can have his own,1
5,"Love Alexa!
  
",12.Dec.19,Yes,"Living alone,  Alexa is a nice way to wake up and say ""Good Morning Alexa"" - she then rattles for about a minute about a fact of the day and even adds some humor to it.  When I come home - I say ""Alexa I'm home"" - she then welcomes me home.  And of course, there's always those silly questions you can ask her at anytime.  I don't have electronics to hook her to like turning on lights - TV or other things but still a fun addition to my home to keep me entertained.  For the money -- I highly suggest you get one of these for anyone who lives alone - it's just fun since after all - my two cats don't talk but Alexa does !!  FUN ~",0
4,"Seems to have hearing problems, often!
  
",12.Dec.19,Yes,"Quite a lot of features and usually works well, but it seems to have a lot of hearing problems quite often. Unplugging and plugging back in seems to help, but I don't feel I should have to do this as often as I do. I really like that it can guard your home when you leave; I just wish it was sensitive to more than just smoke detectors and breaking glass. I have come home and forgot to tell Alexa I was home, thus my devices are still ""guarding"" my home and actively listening. Apparently, any other noises do not set off any alarms with the device.",0
3,"Nice but ...
  
",12.Dec.19,Yes,"Bought one almost a year ago, and for some unknown reason it stopped connecting to my WiFi.  After countless calls and multiple chats with Amazon to try to get it to work, they finally gave up and credited me the replacement cost (but not what I paid).  Kudos to Amazon for finally doing the right thing.  Very disappointed that it ""died""--electronics like this should not really die. Fortunately it was still in the one-year warranty.  Would have been really pissed if it died a month later.",0
5,"Great sound quality
  
",12.Dec.19,Yes,I purchased an Echo some months back and wanted an Echo Dot for my camper in the summer. Setup pretty much does itself and the sound quality is almost as good as the full sized Echo. The only think I would like to see different is for me to be able to customize the name of the device and be able to rename it to a name I could choose and not just one of the four names the Alexa app has available. My great grandson's name is Alex so I had to change the name as it was hearing people every time they called Alex. Keep up the good work Amazon.,0
5,"More than marvelous!!!
  
",12.Dec.19,Yes,I look myself as a child with this toy. It is good to ply with it although it is very useful. I bought an special bulb for my lamp no too expensive and every night when I am goingo to prepare to sleep I say Alexa turn on the light and I finish my preparation to sleep I say Alexa until tomorrow then she repeats a Bible thought I have configured previously and play for 2 hours instrumental music that I also configurated. It is wonderful because she does many things more.,0
5,"I'm impressed.
  
",12.Dec.19,Yes,"I bought a few Alexa enabled devices this past Black Friday and I'm hooked. I get my weather and news report while I brush my teeth. My lights are activated by my voice. I can turn on/off the Christmas tree and coffee pot, and listen to a podcast or music with my echo smart speaker. One surprise I didn't know it was capable of was guarding my home by listening for smoke detectors or glass breaking while I'm away. Yeah I'm a fan of these little smart things.",0
5,"Love how easy it is to use.
  
",12.Dec.19,Yes,"I bought this as an experiment, to see if I would enjoy streaming music in the dining room, and I love it.  It picks up my voice much further away than I thought it would.  Five minutes to set up and start using, paired with Alexa app on my phone.  I'm thinking of getting another one for my bedroom to use when I have lots of music filing to do in there.  The sound is kind of small, but clear.  I purchased a sound bar designed for pcs and I'm using that to fill the large room and little better.",0
4,"Voice recognition not as good as 2nd gen
  
",12.Dec.19,Yes,"Seems like 3rd gen has issues picking up voice as sometimes I end up having to yell _lexa several times for it to hear me, regardless of volume level. Don_ have that issue with 2nd gen. Good sound quality though and still use it everyday.",1
1,"It spies on you
  
",12.Dec.19,Yes,It listen when you don_ want it too and send info to amazon.  I got this free when I bought something else on amazon. Never wanted it and plan on giving it away or destroying it.  I_ be surprised if amazon let this review go through.,1
5,"Love my Alexa
  
",12.Dec.19,Yes,"I love my Alexa! Easily set it up myself (67 year old woman, average tech-savy). The shopping list is awesome, love the music she plays (great selection of Beatles and Rolling Stones songs), love the temperature and weather, love her setting a timer for the kitchen, etc. The only thing I haven't figured out is the calendar integration with my iPhone, but I will. Definitely recommend.",0
1,"Dont buy without a warranty
  
",12.Dec.19,Yes,"Do not buy this product without a warranty. I bought one 4 months ago and today it randomly stopped working. I hardly ever used it, but today in the middle of a song it just stopped working. Tried all the troubleshooting methods, nothing worked, call Amazon to replace it they said my limited warranty expired in October, and offered a measly 15% despite the website saying I could return it by June 2020. I never have problems with any of my orders but I am very unpleased with this, I purchased 3 dots this week for gifts, but I will be sending all 3 back",1
5,"It took minutes to set up.
  
",12.Dec.19,Yes,"After trying out my step mother Echo Dot (3rd Gen), it turned a septic into a believer and I just had to have one of my own. I just love it. It took minutes to set up. I have already brought some for friends.The only thing you need to know as a windows 10 user there is know app for the Echo. In order to set it up you need to go to alexa.amazon.com. Any additional set up will need to be done there also.",0
5,"One Alexa to rule them all... well 2, I own 2
  
",12.Dec.19,Yes,"I have both the 2nd and 3rd generation now, and the speakers on this one are way more intense. I do reccomend you doing the voice recognition to help her learn. The technology has come a long way and yes, there are moments when you just wanna throw her across the room, but remember... each day it learns more and she remembers. She knows almost everything and when the technology come back to take over the world, Pinky, she will remember you. Other than that it's a great fun product to have and easy to use and I love turning my house (lights, tv, fan, lamps, coffee maker etc.) on and off with her. Enjoy! __",0
3,"Sometimes, in the Everywhere mode, two different songs are played
  
",12.Dec.19,Yes,"It seems that the Echo's do not integrate well.  The way I am using my four Echo's is as a single speaker system, with only one Echo serving as the host to receive commands.  In this setup, there are times that the songs being played are different between the 'host Echo' and the other three--with the host playing one song and the other three together playing a different song.  Another problem is that the 'system' seems to act as if it has been playing a station even when it is commanded to be off---not that anyone hears it but it seems to continue to stream---and then when the host receives a command to play a particular station it just continues playing the station that was previously playing---picking up in the middle of a song.  You've still got 'bugs' that need to be worked out.",0
5,"They work good for smart home, tvs, lights and music
  
",12.Dec.19,Yes,"We use it to control a lot of things in our house, play music in the gym, kitchen, nursery, bathroomControls smart plugs connected to Christmas tree and Christmas lightsLights, tvs, oven,You can use it as intercom and drop in on other rooms or listen in on babyAny questions I have I can look up or contact support",0
5,"Big fan of Alexa
  
",12.Dec.19,Yes,"We don_ even use all the features Alexa is capable of but Alexa replaced all our alarm clocks and is a great resource for basic questions. We have one in kitchen and bedrooms, I like asking Alexa cooking questions when I have my hands full. Also great for communicating with family upstairs without having to scream across the house",0
5,"Terrific Companion for my Mom
  
",12.Dec.19,Yes,"She loves the ability to ask for music, check the weather, request a joke, set a time while cooking, confirm the time on the West Coast, etc. etc. It really is a terrific always available, smart companion. And it doesn't take up a lot of space, and the speaker sounds terrific. Overall very happy and would recommend.",0
4,"Wonderful device for $25 but has some annoyances
  
",13.Dec.19,Yes,"Overall I enjoy using the echo dot as a temporary toy. We've spent hours goofing around with it, listening to music, asking it silly questions, setting reminders etc. There are some glaring items of improvement for me though.1. STOP PLAYING LIVE MUSIC. If I want live music I would deliberately request it. On 25% of the songs I've wanted to play, Alexa starts playing a live version or a cover version of a song, and with the live versions I can't find a way to tell her to play the studio version of the songs. I almost never want to hear live music from a stream so please change that. I've had to tell Alexa STOP way too many times because she starts playing a live version of a song and I just don't want to hear it.2. This device needs a power off button. Not a mute button, not a ""don't disturb"" function, an actual turn off button. When I don't want to use Alexa, I don't want it on and it's a pain plugging and unplugging it over and over again. If I mute the device, then this glowing red ring lights up and burns electricity. To those people who don't care about your privacy and trust Amazon completely, I don't need to hear about just leaving it on and unmuted because Alexa won't ""activate"" unless you use the wake up word, I don't care. I want the device off and without power. I know the development teams have gone through the rounds and have chosen to not include one. I'm asking them to reconsider.3. The sales pitches. If we're prime members, can we get a function to turn off ""ads""? Every time I request a song, Alexa needs to tell me it's playing from Amazon music. This is unnecessary and annoying. Also because I don't have Amazon music, every time I play a song that's not part of the included 2 million song catalog, Alexa goes into the same spiel about how I can sign up for Amazon music and the free trial. I got it the first 30 times Alexa, the answer is still no, stop repeating it.It's a cute toy to play around with, but this device clearly presents itself as a way for Amazon to constantly pitch its products and services to you, and they've made it to where turning it off is a chore. I'm sure more functionality and features are on the way, hopefully Amazon decides to consider some of my above proposals. A lot more people would jump on board and use the devices more often if they did.",1
5,"Oh my gosh! For such a small little girl, Alexa has a big presence!
  
",13.Dec.19,Yes,"I have three Amazon Alexa products not including the Echo Auto (which really needs to be improved) and I love every one of my little Alexa girls. I am a dog sitter and I had a puppy tangle with my original Alexa in my living room and the puppy one. This time I got the 3rd generation Dot and I'm so glad I did. The setup was easier than the originals and the voice recognition and quality is so much better than my original Dots. I love this little sucker! I got the dark gray and it is absolutely invisible on a dark gray etagere in my living room which is what I wanted. It has such a low profile but a large chunk of electronics inside that work beautifully.  You know what's weird? for only 3 days I didn't have a working Alexa downstairs in my house. And for three days I missed asking all those questions during the day. it kind of makes me laugh when I think about it, because I didn't realize how much I used it until it wasn't there. From the temperature outside to what time a store down the street closed to how old somebody is that I saw on television. Yep. This is my addiction and I'm proud of it!",0
5,"Affordable and creating routines and linking skills makes for an enjoyable hobby.
  
",13.Dec.19,Yes,"I have recently been introduced to the Echo system and, although there is a learning curve, I enjoy adding skills and routines to the Echo. I now have five in my household due the the affordable prices offered during Black Friday. The Dot is well built and sufficiently heavy not to be easily knocked off a nightstand or desk. As others have noticed, the sound quality is not that of the larger Echos, but I find it perfectly adequate for listening to radio and music while working in my home office. After experimenting with the 3rd generation Dot I added the upgraded model that has a clock face, as well as the smaller Show 5, which has a display. The only negative comments I would make are that Alexa does not always understand my commands. But I have alleviated some of that by giving smart home devices simple, short names. I am also impressed with the connectivity to the Apple world allowed via the Alexa app for iOS. Highly recommended.",0
1,"NIghtmare
  
",13.Dec.19,Yes,"Like so many things, it's great when it works.  But with the Alexa products  when there's a problem - it's a nightmare.  I just spent 1 1/2 hours getting into my Alexa App because I took my dot with me when I went to my son's house for two weeks.  OMG.  Only 1 1/2 lines of the authentication characters showed.  How can you enter characters you can't see?  After that it was a good twenty minutes navigating how to get a phone call from the Alexa people - and then another 20 trying to navigate the prompts without getting cut off.  Third time was a charm, I finally got a person!  This person eventually checked with her supervisor and was eventually able to connect me with someone in the right department.  The new person was very nice and hung in there with me and in only about another half hour my dot was finally connected.  The good news is that it finally worked and the woman was very professional.  The really bad news is that it shouldn't be anywhere near this difficult!  I'm done buying echo products.",0
5,"A Great Improvement
  
",13.Dec.19,Yes,"The sound is a great improvement over the version 2.I am not someone who is particularly picky about sound quality and was quite satisfied with the sound quality of the Dot 2. I have one Echo and sevaral Dots - one in every room. When the Dot 3 price dropped to $22 i thought i'd try it just to see the difference.  And what a difference it is. The sound is a notable improvement - louder, purer, more mellow.Besides being radio, clock, alarm, weather thermometer, and information source, Alexa controls a living room light, porch light, grow lamps for indoor plants, and home thermostat. Alexa has become an indispensible part of my life.",0
4,"Works as intended, mostly
  
",13.Dec.19,Yes,"Nice sleek design that leaves a small footprint  Adding the easy install wall mountvallowas you to put it in a convent location. Some small issue with voice commands like stop, which has to often be repeated twice but overall a very good item. Have been to set up multiple routines with ease. Runs my smart lights and iRobot and easily finds my favorite rasio stations or music apps. However, integration with the echo connect has been a nightmae. Disconnects mid call for no apparent reason, hence the 4stars. Don_ know if this is a dot issue or a connect issue.",0
5,"Excellent Buy
  
",13.Dec.19,Yes,"love it... So many positive things to say about this product for anyone looking for assistance in the home... Alexa does so many things. This is a great item for elderly,disabled and the entire family! So much you can do with this!!! I would give 10 stars if i could. Alexa  does it all... monitors our home when we go out, turns on and off the lights, tv and outlets, tells the weather, she has skills that help nearly everyday living... plus fun skills for kids and all ages.... I highly recommend this product for anyone looking to simplify their daily routine.",0
4,"Vastly better sound
  
",13.Dec.19,Yes,"This is a nice upgrade over gen 2. The sound is significantly better this time around. I mean, not a subtle difference. The gen 3 really seems to project sound while the gen 2 was struggling to be heard.Same Alexa problems (she isn't great with questions). Also still finicky about interrupted connections. I have to pull the plug then plug it back in occasionally when my DSL is being unreliable.It's a bit bigger than gen 2 as well, so I doubt any accessories from gen 2 would work with this revision",0
5,"Way better sound than the 1st &amp; 2nd generations.
  
",13.Dec.19,Yes,"I was amazed at how much better the sound is in this device compared to the 1st &amp; 2nd generation Dot. It's night and day difference. When you get it up to a very high volume, you can tell where it could stand to improve, such as in the full Echo. That's to be expected. Though at low to medium volume, you'll be very happy with it. Sounds good. Knowing this, I'd probably turn away from a full $99 Echo next time and go with this. I now plan to upgrade from the 1st &amp; 2nd gen Dots in my house with this new one.",0
4,"Dimmer
  
",13.Dec.19,Yes,"I absolutely love the new Echo Dot with the alarm clock. The only thing I don_ and it_ minor, is the dimmer capability on the display. I wish there was a way that you could set it for evening to be one level and day time another level. The only option is for it to auto self adjust and I would like to be able to set it for day and night separately and leave it at those two settings. Other than that it is great! Sound quality, accuracy, features, pairing other items with it all are great.",0
4,"Good sound and fun for family
  
",13.Dec.19,Yes,I have been using my echo dot for the last two weeks and it is great!! Sound quality is way better than I would expect from this tiny device.. voice recognition is good but needs improvement. It is sometimes having hard time understanding comments when there is bakcground noise.. and not sure if it is specific to my wifi/location of echo dot but I had multiple times that it lost connection and reconnected.. it is frustrating but can live with it.. all members of my family loves to interact with Alexa and it is quite fun.. definitely recommending to everyone..,0
5,"The Echo Dot is really fun to work with
  
",13.Dec.19,Yes,"I never really wanted one of these but for .99 my oldest son talked me into getting it and I love it.  I ordered 2 days ago and recieved it today. The packaging was great. Easy setup on my pc and I have been playing with it all day. I don't have much right now to connect her too but she still answers all my questions and plays what music I want her to play from Amazon Music and my iHeart Radio. She even told my 2 year old grandson a cute little story after asking him what is name was, his favorite color and favorite animal. She also can read your books to you which is awesome. I plan on getting light bulbs and other devices to use with her but for now I am really satisfied with what I purchased.",0
5,"One of the best purchases I_e made in awhile.
  
",13.Dec.19,Yes,"Have enjoyed having the Alexa dot in our living room, my mom liked it so much that she got one for her bedroom. I was thinking of getting one for my bedroom but it didn_ make sense with the type of alarm I had since it also played music. As soon as I saw this one I snapped it up! I love it! One of the best things about it is how the time adjusts to the lighting of the room, the way it dims when the lights are off make for a very nice sleeping environment.",0
3,"It_ useful when prodded and you finally work out the integration bugs.
  
",13.Dec.19,Yes,Swore I_ never get anything that would sit there and listen to me but I did Lol. I still have my concerns but I live alone so it_ not hearing much. It_ got superior sound quality compared to the google speaker but I have issues with finding stuff. I usually have to ask it 5 different ways before I get the answer I already know the answer to. I_ just testing it to see if I should give it to my 22 year old...or maybe I_l keep it haha. Hooking it up to Spotify took forever.,0
4,"Simple Setup, the experience is an 8.5/10
  
",13.Dec.19,Yes,"Surprisingly good sound quality! One dot won_ wow you, but if you buy them and put the around your house, the volume is adequate with surprising clarity with the bass. It_ not THUMPING but is clear at casual listening levels.My biggest issue is the inability to use more than one Spotify account with the Alexa system at home.Using the household profiles doesn_ switch Spotify profiles for some reason. Alexa will switch profiles but still play from the same Spotify account.The only workaround I_e found so that my wife and I are not kicking each other off the same account is to download my main playlists and use Spotify offline while I_ not home and she has full range to stream while at home.We have the family plan and Alexa WILL NOT change spotify profiles, or at least not YET. I_ sure an update will fix that shortly.",0
5,"Awesome little speaker with Alexa!
  
",13.Dec.19,Yes,"A friend has the big Echo and we were playing with it.  When I saw this deal for under $9 bucks I had to get it.  The sound is really good for such a small speaker!  Asking Alexa to play songs, albums, what the temperature or weather is can be fun!  You just ask Alexa to play your favorite songs,  artists, a genre of music, even remixes! Have her tell you a joke even!  I was a bit skeptical at first, but the sound is very good and it's fun!",0
5,"It was time to leave the past behind.
  
",13.Dec.19,Yes,I decided it was time to join the 21st century and get rid of my 20 year old clock radio when I woke up in a panic the morning Day Light Savings ended thinking I was late after looking at my clock radio.  Having the Echo Dot is great.  It has all the functionality of Alexa and I still have the time display so I know what time it is if I wake up in the middle of the night.  One of the main reasons I kept my clock radio for so long.  Being able to wake to Jeremy Clarkson and the guys from The Grand Tour yelling at me is just the icing on the cake.  Money well spent!!!,0
5,"Would definitely buy again!
  
",13.Dec.19,Yes,"This does everything! Great little gizmo! Very helpful and is getting smarter by the day. Recognizes my voice with ease. Would only change two things: I have another one of these that I gave to my mom, she_ in a different part of the house in her bedroom and her Echo doesn_ recognize her voice, instead it calls her by my name and 2nd, the drop in function is by far my favorite, because of wonderful safety uses, but the mic volume is too low. When Mom and I use this feature, it is not always the easiest to hear the other person.",0
5,"Creating a smart house, one Alexa at a time.
  
",13.Dec.19,Yes,"I love all the Alexa compatible devices that I own. I work from home and don't have anyone to talk to, so she is my main companion during the day until hubby gets home. Sounds silly, I know. But the dot is a great addition to the house; we set it up in the kitchen. It's great for listening to music while making breakfast, learning about traffic before my hubby leaves for work, and a variety of other things that I find useful on almost a daily basis.",0
5,"Great stereo sound, linked
  
",13.Dec.19,Yes,"I bought 2 of these so I have stereo sound in the living room and the master bedroom. I didn_ link the other one but I like having it in the back bedroom for when I use the air dyne.  Such a nice addition for anyone who loves music or has a smart home. I don_ use this for my cams but if I wanted to, I could with another alexa accessory.  Nice app once you play with it and customizable it.",0
5,"Makes my life easier
  
",13.Dec.19,Yes,"I am always finding new ways to have fun with my Echo's! This week I discovered that I can use them as an intercom system - even from my phone when I am at work to ""talk"" to family members who are in the living room, or my guy upstairs in the bedroom! You just tell your alexa app which Dot you want to communicate with and it makes it so easy!!! Love love love my Echo Dots!",0
5,"Easy to setup and use.
  
",13.Dec.19,Yes,Easy to connect to your home wifi. I wish I could add rename each and use them as 2 way intercom type. I know you can use commands lime announce and it will to all my 4 dots. Other than that playing music is ok because there are other devices with small architecture that have much nicer much more powerful output. I do like the Bluetooth integration but is limited.,0
5,"I ""thought"" i wouldnt like it...
  
",13.Dec.19,Yes,"First off My echo dot vocier recognition is amazingthe call feature really loud and clear... doesn't hang up on accident or anythingAlexa doesn't randomly speak without being spoken none of that weird ""talking to it self stuff""Wonderful purchase use it with my Christmas lights and house lights and morning coffee!!! I like it a lot frfr and you will to",0
5,"The device that just keeps getting better and better with each revision
  
",14.Dec.19,Yes,"Okay so first off I'd like to say that I had a gen 1 echo for a few years now and it finally burnt out and I missed it so I purchased this gen 3 thinking it was going to be the same quality as the echo one, I was completely wrong the weight of this device is a lot more than the old echo device the size of it is a little bit bigger in diameter and has a much much better speaker in it. I was amazed at the quality of the audio that came out of that little device almost comprable to Bose integration is exactly the same as the Gen 1 and Gen 2 it's very easy as long as you follow the directions the power cord I noticed is alot beefier for this one I would say it's almost double the size of the old one. How this differs is this is an actual circular power plug that being said you cannot hook this up to any USB device to power it like you could with the gen ones this does have a small quarter inch headphone jack to allow you to put speakers externally to it. I did notice this is much louder than the old generation 1 echoes and much clearer. And with Amazon offering them for around $25 I'm just going to say you're a fool if you don't purchase one they even make set up very easy if you choose to have them add it to your existing account. That being said all you have to do is connected to Wi-Fi and you're done. I would recommend purchasing the smart lights and smart outlets to use with this that's how I found the most use out of this device and I've been using this for years you can literally connect almost any smart device to the echo so that it can be voice controlled. I currently use this for lights in my house as well as outlets plus I have it control outdoor Christmas lights on a timer which is also hooked up to music through prime music that being said there is just an amazing amount of uses for this product and it seems like they just keep getting better and better and better. Because they invented this voice control I guess you could say I would stick with them over Google or any of the other companies that may provide these devices I have never been a huge Amazon fan but they have actually done something fantastic with these devices. I think at least every home should have at least one of them. And if privacy is your main concern don't worry laws are in place that prevent the company from snooping in on your private data.Amazon really doesn't want a billion dollar class action lawsuit on them so they take this seriously. I purchased one for my wife and will probably be purchasing a few more to send to my kids so they can enjoy the device as I have enjoyed it",0
4,"Sound Quality
  
",14.Dec.19,Yes,"I'm of an age where my hearing is going.... Sigh....  I have a couple of Echo Dots, a 2 and a 3. Because of hearing loss, I much prefer the '2' over the 3.  I need no bass, and high treble, and '2' fits the bill here.With the 3, right out of the box, it is so 'bassy' I just hear an annoying low frequency rumble, which is almost impossible to understand.  I spent many hours looking for tone controls to set bass low and treble high but the '3' doesn't seem to have this capabilty.  I did find a comment somewhere that others are experiencing this, and that both bass and treble can be adjusted by asking alexa to 'set bass to minimum' and 'set treble to maximum' (IIRC these were the commands) but the sound quality for me is still way to blurry and fuzzy.  I would have returned it except it is fine for other members of the family (and grandkids).So, my recco is that if you're experiencing age-related hearing loss, think twice before you buy one...",0
2,"my news brief ""is not available"" after 2 minutes...
  
",14.Dec.19,Yes,"I've accumulated numerous Echo devices ever since I was given the opportunity to purchase the 1st generation Echo at the pre-production price of $99 a few years back.  Always impressed and always satisfied until I purchased the 3rd generation Echo Dot with Clock and added it to my home network.  In spite of all of my other Echoes continuing to work just perfectly, this particular 'Dot with Clock' will provide my new brief but after ~2 minutes the news story (in progress) simply stops and I am informed that ""---- is not available at this time"".  Not sure if this is a conspiracy or if it is a glitch in the software for this Dot... Either way, it is disappointing, and none of the online solutions are helpful as I've deleted, re-added, reset and renewed the Dot and all of my news subscriptions.  It's a nice clock and it does play music (I'm a Prime member) stations, but I have always looked forward to my news brief each morning and this has definitely been a disappointment.",1
2,"OK, but glad I bought it at a discount
  
",14.Dec.19,Yes,"The Echo Dot is OK, but just OK. I bought it to use as a speaker for my Kindle Fire. Setup was more of a hassle than I expected. Setup isn't particularly complex, but some steps took multiple tries. Also, the Echo seems to lose its connection to the Fire after periods of inactivity. This isn't a big deal. I just unplug the Echo Dot and it re-connects when I plug it back in. The biggest problem I had is that my alarm, which is on the Fire, didn't play through the Dot. There's an alarm on the Dot, but I prefer the native clock on the Fire.Update: The poor quality of the Alexa app leads me to reduce my review to two stars. It's just awful. It's likely I'll return the Echo due to the poor quality of the app.The notification lights are also an issue at night. There may be a way to turn them off, but I don't really want to invest the time to figure it out. By the way, I realize that what I'm seeing as problems are actually features for most users. But, four stars seems fair, given the flaky setup and periodic loss of connection.",0
5,"Great sound
  
",14.Dec.19,Yes,"We had a first gen echo and recently upgraded to a fire box so we figured we didnt need one upstairs anymore.I was missing my upstairs echo so I took advantage of the .99 promo for this one. I'm extremely glad I did- The sound on this one is phenomenal. My reasoning for this one is the alexa integration. So I'm using my downstairs Alexa to communicate with upstairs. Planning on getting one for each of the other rooms too, for like an intercom thing, so I dont have to yell for the kids anymore. Music is clear and crisp on it. I haven't used it for anything other than asking the time, weather, playing music, or talking to my other Alexa. But for now it's working perfect for what I need it for.",0
1,"DON'T BUY IT IF YOU VALUE YOUR SANITY
  
",14.Dec.19,Yes,"This product is the worst.  It simply does not work.  I have to leave a review because it has absolutely driven me mad trying to link it, trying to get it to play my Apple music, trying to get it to do the simplest things that its own instruction book tells you it should do.  So tired of Alexa telling me I don't know how to do that when it is as simple request as to turn on the newly purchased Smart TV that came with the very Echo Dot, all of which was paired multiple times.  Then, there's the Apple music pairing issue where on some days it works and on others not so much.  Prepare yourself pls.  You will go crazy trying to pair it and to figure out why in the Alexa app it shows everything as paired but there is Alexa telling you that you still have to pair it.  Over and over again you will lose sanity trying to get it to simply play a song right in front of you.  No way to override the madness and to shove the damn song down Alexa's throat so she will spit it back out at you to inevitably play the one song right there on the app.  And then there is the issue of telling Alexa to play an album only to have her play one song from the album instead of the entire thing an what seems to be a concerted effort to only play Amazon music.My advice whether this Echo Dot was free or $100 or $20 - don't do it.  Don't buy it.  Save your sanity.  Save your precious time that will be invested in fixing all the problems that will arise and suck you in so you can get this DUMB PIECE OF EQUIPMENT to work correctly.Horrible piece of crap doesn't really do it justice.  If it was free to me, I'd take a hammer to it.  That, truly, would give me joy right after Alexa tells me she doesn't know how to do something she's done a million times over.  THE HAMMER AND A QUICK BURIAL WITH THE BROOM AND A TRASH CAN.  That only would bring peace to this generation of Echo Dot.",0
5,"Bigger.
  
",14.Dec.19,Yes,"This is huge in comparison to the echo dot first generation dots. I'm glad I have several smaller ones for the bathrooms, they are better for wall hanging. But this is nice too, I got it for my sewing room. I have six dots already, this is my 7th and only third generation. I have four large towers, which I love. We use them all over our house and all my children's homes have several as well. The only bad point I will mention is that they only allow you to access prime music on four. All my others are Spotify connected on subscription without ads.The sound isn't as good as the towers, but this is simply a matter of price point. For twenty two bucks it is quite appropo.",0
5,"Echo dot 3rd generation makes previous one look like it communicated with smoke signals!
  
",14.Dec.19,Yes,"I love my echo dot second generation so it wasn't easy to to decide to upgrade to the 3rd, untill it arrived ! I am in love with it. First it is bilingual! So it really understands my Spanglish! The speakers r awesome can really loud. It looks so beautiful I don't get tire of looking at it. I chosed the deal with the mini plug and used it with a power surge and plug all the living room lamps to it. I can just ask Alexa to turn lights off from bed and the living room goes black. I will get a couple of plugs more and soon kitchen appliances will b smart by default and the bedroom after. If only I can teach Alexa how to cook I will marry her.",0
2,"Disappointing!
  
",14.Dec.19,Yes,"After reading the glowing description, we thought the newer Dots would work a whole lot better. True, the music sounds somewhat less like a transistor radio, but now, the audio quality is muffled and muddy, even after adjusting the tone controls.The voice recognition remains abominably poor, as does the responsiveness of the device, itself. Should I really have to bellow in my moderate sized kitchen to get a response? No, I don't think so. We'd hoped the ""improved"" mics would perform better, but no dice.I suggest you save your money, folks. Who knows? Genuine improvements might be down the road.",0
4,"Great addition to any room.
  
",14.Dec.19,Yes,"My daughter is in love with this and to be honest I'm not used to talking to a machine. But children don't have this issue, since life is always a 1st experience with no fear. But as an adult I must say I really do like it. But i only have one con and maybe this is a sony issue. i can turn on my tv no problem but it dont do apps and i don';t know if it can learn how to do it for me but. If i focus on just the unit its self. Its clear it works and it can read a book instead of watching tv we just listen to music, books, and jokes. So to me Alexa is the new turn knob radio that was used in the early 60's. It brings the family in one room and no screen time.",0
5,"Great gadget for your home!
  
",14.Dec.19,Yes,"I love the look and quality of this newer Echo Dot. The speaker on it has improved so much that I rarely connect to my stereo system speakers using Bluetooth anymore, like I did with my first Echo Dot. The only issue I have is that it doesn't seem to be as responsive as my first Echo Dot. Sometimes I feel like I have to shout to be heard, whereas my first Echo Dot seemed to hear me when I whispered. But I still love it and recommend it to all my friends. We have 3 Dots, and one of our favorite features is that you can use them like an intercom system. No more shouting upstairs to the kid!",0
3,"Sound quality is fine, but Alexa sure is dumb
  
",14.Dec.19,Yes,"TL:DR - This is a perfectly fine bluetooth speaker and well worth what I paid for it (99 cents with an Unlimited Music subscription of 7.99 which you can immediately cancel if you wish) but don't expect voice command functionality to impress.To be frank, I didn't buy this device to listen to the weather, control the lights in my house, or operate a home security system.  My phone can tell me the weather, and light switches and manual locks have worked fine so far.  I got this because I like listening to music or videos while I cook, clean, and work on the computer at my table.  So basically I'm in it for a bluetooth speaker.  And I have to say, it's kind of neat to have a bluetooth speaker that accepts voice commands.  The problem is in how it responds to those voice commands.Me: ""Alexa, set the volume to fifty percent.""Alexa: ""Sorry, you can only set the volume between zero and ten.""Me: ""Alexa, what is fifty percent of ten?""Alexa: ""Fifty percent of ten is five.""This is the problem I've had with every voice assistant I've encountered so far.  You can't speak to them in everyday language using simple concepts that a computer should be able to understand.  Alexa should be smart enough to know that fifty percent is the same as five out of ten.  If you can't give the device simple, direct commands and have those commands be understood, then why have voice control?As far as a speaker goes, this is about what you would expect from a bluetooth speaker of this size.  You're not going to get clear and sparkling highs, but the overall sound is strong and there's the perfect amount of bass response if like me you enjoy music but also live in close quarters and aren't trying to disturb the neighbors.5 stars for Voice recognition - It knows what I'm saying.2 stars for Alexa integration - The device understands my words, but it doesn't know what they mean or act on them.4 stars for Sound quality - I hoped for a bit more clarity, but this is perfectly adequate for a speaker of this size and cost.",0
4,"Improved sound / setup issue
  
",14.Dec.19,Yes,"Bought this 3rd Gen Dot because of the special price, already have 4 2nd gen dots. At first, could not get it to link up, even with tech help. A replacement was delivered the next day. It wouldn,t link up using my A50 Samsung, had my daughter try with her iPhone. It still would not register. She then Bluetooth linked the Dot to her phone before putting the Dot into setup mode. This worked. Liked the improved sound and price so I had her setup the first one and keep it too. Very good tech service even if they couldn't solve the problem.",0
5,"Great Product
  
",14.Dec.19,Yes,"This is my third Dot and it works great for controlling lights, etc.  I also like the new feature for glass breakage and smoke/ CO monitoring and alerts - a really useful feature.  The sound quality is very good for the Dot itself... for one of my Dots I've connected the output to my existing  home stereo system and the sound quality is AMAZING and thanks to a Kasa switch I can now turn my amp on/off with voice commands and use the Dot to control what is playing and the volume level.",0
5,"I am sold!!!
  
",14.Dec.19,Yes,"I bought one and a Kasa smart plug as an experiment when they were on sale. Installation wasn't difficult and I was so impressed when Alexa turned on my livingroom lights, played Christmas music and added items to my shopping list.  I bought a second one to put in my bedroom so that Alexa can call my daughter if I need her (I'm a healthy 81 year old, but need support system). Now, no matter where I am in the house, Alexa can hear me and help to keep me safe.",0
4,"Great for home automation. Wish it was easier to group multiple speakers as default.
  
",14.Dec.19,Yes,"I really liked having these echo dots around the house. Voice recognition works well for me, but spotty with my wife. Sound quality isn_ too bad at lower volumes. I wish I could have multiple speakers grouped together for playing music without having to say the group. If I_ downstairs and I ask it to play music, why can_ all of the speakers in that area automatically play rather than having to define a group and tell it to play on said group. Usually, by the time I get to saying which speaker group I want them to play on, Alexa has already started playing the song on the default speaker in that area.",0
5,"Alexa is my BFF
  
",14.Dec.19,Yes,"OMG, Alexa is my new best friend. I bought one for my bedroom and one for my living room, and I couldn't be happier. I'm a total scatterbrain, so it's amazing that I can just ask Alexa to add an item to my To Do or Shopping List the second I think of it (before I forget again). It syncs with the Alexa app, so I can just pull up my lists on my phone while I'm out. You can also play some games, set alarms, listen to music, use it as a white noise machine... the list goes on and on. Now I just need one for my car, and I'll be all set!",0
5,"Amazing, Love It
  
",14.Dec.19,Yes,"I absolutely love it just got it in today, I got it sooner then it said. It said that it would be back in stock on December 16th got notified yesterday the 13th that was shipped and was gonna get it Sunday the 15th but nope instead got it Saturday the 14th. The sound is so much better then the echo dot 1st edition! I love the color, now they need to get it in color blue, yes they have blue for kids edition ones but need it in blue for all. You wont be disappointed. I'm happy with my purchase.",0
3,"Great having but can't set up stereo
  
",14.Dec.19,Yes,"I was given a Echo 5 Show as a gift.  I love it and went out and purchased another Echo 5 Show.  Thinking that everything echo is compatible, I went and purchased two more echo dots (3rd generation) to put in other rooms.  Things worked ok but when I purchased 3 more echo dots for the purpose of giving me stereo in all the rooms I began to have problems.  I have been unable to get stereo to work with the combination of a Echo Show and a Dot in the same room.  Tried a number of things without success.  Even just added a Dot to the room and made them both into a group but then the vol controls still work independently on each unit.  When I called Amazon support (who are really outstanding) they told me that I could only set up stereo if I was using the same units.  For example, I could use 2 dots and set it up or 2 Echo Shows but not a Show and a Dot.  I wish I had known this before I went out and purchased 3 more dots.",0
1,"Lasted less than 6 months (DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY)
  
",14.Dec.19,Yes,"I have a first generation echo dot and it works great.  Bought this one and have had lots of issues.  Its been 6 months and Amazon will not replace it or repair it.REALLY AMAZON!I can't believe it.  I am so disappointed in this device, but more so with Amazon.",1
4,"i love the echo, but it isn't flawless
  
",14.Dec.19,Yes,"I love the echo it is nice to have the hands-free support. The only things that bother me about using it is that it isn't always consistent. I have a routine set up to turn on a light at 6:25 AM every day and some days it goes through the routine and other days it doesn't, and I have no idea why. And sometimes it doesn't recognize my voice so I have to kind of yell at it. But overall I am very happy with it, I've bought two and keep considering buying more for the other rooms of my house.",0
4,"Useful
  
",14.Dec.19,Yes,"Pretty useful. Occasionally doesn't hear/process my voice the first time, but overall pretty good. I like being able to turn the lights on/off from my bed. Easily get the weather while getting ready in the morning. Can look up stuff, even shop if you dont need to see a picture of what you're buying. Also if you change the wake word to computer, you feel like a star trek character.",0
5,"For a BUCK! Nice addition to my desk.
  
",14.Dec.19,Yes,"How can one pass up one of these for $0.99 (plus one month of Amazon Music Unlimited for $7.99)? Took all of 2 minutes to setup. Took another 2 minutes to connect my Sony TV skill. Not expecting much use, but it does my phone calls, weather, alarm, and some music (though the sound is not the best but it is only a 1.6"" speaker). Not bad for a large PUCK on my desk.",0
3,"This Item Just Did Not Work For Me  But I Am Willing Check Out the Echo Show 5
  
",15.Dec.19,Yes,The product had amazing sound but would not play more then a few songs and shut off.  I have an Echo Dot 2 and they would not connect.  I can ask my echo dot 2 to play the rolling stones and it will literally play for days.  I would ask the echo dot 3 and it was a crap shoot.  I have the echo dots to play  music 24 hours a day.  I have 2 little dogs and I have found if I play music all the time they are more calm as the outside noises of apartment living are kept at a minimum.  The echo dot would not perform in that manner.  I tried to connect the two of them and it looked good on the ipad but they never connected to play the same music thru out the apt.  I would come home and the echo 3 would be off and I would have a panicked dog.  Not cool.  Amazon Sent me a new echo dot 3 and it lasted for maybe 2 months... the speakers sounded blown.  Amazon sent me a return label...  Since I love my echo dot 2 I have ordered an echo show 5 and I am praying I love it!!  I have had more good luck with amazon products then bad so I am willing to continue using their products.  They did refund me for the echo dot 3!  Thank You Amazon for standing behind your products!!,0
3,"It does just what it says it will and quite well, but...
  
",15.Dec.19,Yes,"If you have a smart phone, pretty much like just about everyone does.. and you have a bluetooth speaker, like a lot of people do, then you don't need this taking up more space in your home.  I just put mine in the trash  due to this reason..no need for it.. OH, and if you work in the same room as this thing, and you make long calls for work, this will think you are asking for something and start talking to you in the background. Not cool when you are on a business call.  I also didn't like that it was yet another device that is probably monitoring every word I say.so, just use your smart phone and a blue tooth speaker that probably has better sound anyway..I got mine for ""free"" during a Sirius XM promo when the price was $50. Then they were giving them away for $22 at Christmas.. yah, that tells you all you need to know. Save your money",0
1,"Not impressed
  
",15.Dec.19,Yes,"Got a 3rd gen as a gift and simply not impressed. This is my first Alexa product other than fire tv remote. So far not impressed for the 4hrs I_e spent trying to integrate my home WiFi outlets, thermostat, fire tv ect I literally could have go gotten up off the chair for the rest of my life to turn these items on off up down ect and have 3hrs of my life back. Linking fire tv is a joke, still can_ turn fire tv on or off, can_ view amazon photos on tv, can_ turn amazon music on fire tv vs defaulting to playin on the echo. If I have a tv with stereo why would I want to play music on this tiny speaker? Everything non amazon works flawless and was relatively easy to set up and use anything related to amazon is a nightmare and does not work properly via echo/Alexa. It_ almost funny how everything else linked up and set up fine yet everything amazon sucks and won_ link up right or work 100%.",0
3,"Alexa's Voice Sounds Muffled in Gen 3 Version. Sounded Great in Gen 2.
  
",15.Dec.19,Yes,"At first I was impressed with the audio output. Music quality was quite an improvement over gen 2. Then ""she spoke""! Hard to believe this product would be released into the marketplace without addressing this issue. Voice output reminds me of someone talking with a pillow over their face (slight exaggeration). A fellow customer suggested using a bluetooth speaker which makes this device at least tolerable for the time being. With this supplemental accessory that I shouldn't have had to purchase, I can understand her answers to questions like ""What time is it?"" but when setting up timers or reminders the volume level drops to ""1"" making even the BT speaker ""fix"" unacceptable. Please address this with a firmware upgrade or whatever it takes or I will have to continue to convince anyone that asks that they should probably NOT get one.",0
5,"Makes things easy and faster
  
",15.Dec.19,Yes,"So far, I enjoy having an Alexa. I_l admit I_ lazy when it comes to connecting my phone to Bluetooth and finding something to play so this is just one of the things Alexa does for me. There_ a few things I wish she would do though. For example, I created a new playlist using Alexa and it was a little hard for her to understand a few of my requests on it. Like changing the name of my playlist, removing a song from my playlist, or going back to a previous song. I mostly use it for setting timers/reminders, or playing music right now but I haven_ even had it for more than a week so I_l learn more about it as I go. Happy I bought. Even more happy I bought it during cyber week because I wouldn_ have paid its original cost for it.",0
5,"Helpful, fun and simple to use.
  
",15.Dec.19,Yes,"Alexa is my first stand alone virtual assistant. I_e had Siri on my phone but never really utilized it, so I can_ make any comparisons with other units, but I am loving the extra help and the ease of just asking for it. From _hat_ the temperature outside? To _all my (misplaced) phone? Or _all my sons phone To _lay (whatever) song?, she is right there and ready to help. Every request is hand free and can be done while multitasking. It really is helpful and fun. And fear not if you_e not a _echy type, it_ so simple to use. I got a great Cyber Monday deal so I thought I_ give it a try.  Very  happy I did.",0
2,"Alright at a discount
  
",15.Dec.19,Yes,"This is the second smart-home speaker I've got, and it's far less intelligent than the Google Home. The ability to play my Audible and other such things has been enough of a difference to be worth keeping it, but I know from experience with other smart speakers that it's possible to recognize more than this. There are times I've asked it a question only to get an answer either tangentially related, or even unrelated entirely. There was time I asked it a question and got the answer ""No, that's not true,"" which since I asked it to define a word, I'm still not sure about. It also tried to answer by giving the capital of Guam. Once again, not what we asked.It has, however, informed me that birds are real animals and are classified as birds, so that much is worth it.Sound quality is really good, too, best of anything I've seen or had in my home.",0
4,"I love my echo but it doesn't always recognize me or understand me
  
",15.Dec.19,Yes,"I like my echo dot a lot. I am frequently asking it questions and having it set alarms and make lists for me. I like that it will also send reminders to your phone incase you aren't home and therefore cant hear it reminding you. My issue with it is that it sometimes won't recognize me, won't understand what I'm saying, or will just simply not respond even though it was listening. I have it set up as instructed in the open without anything around it so I don't know why it often glitches. Overall I'm pretty happy with it and find myself missing it when I'm not home and need random questions answered.",0
5,"Couldn't live without my echo dots now that I have them!
  
",15.Dec.19,Yes,"I'm so amazed by my echo dot 3rd gen. I've own TONS of speakers and the sounds quality of this blows all of them away! I love how much I can truly customize and program my echo dots to suite my lifestyle and preferences. Alexa had made my very busy life incredibly easier. She sets times and reminders for me, disarms and arms my security system, turns on/off my TVs, turns on/off my lights and fans and does everything I ask. I really do not know how I survived without alexa. I now own 5 echo dot 3rd gens and an echo show 5 along with a kindle fire 7. Thank you amazon for bringing alexa into my life!",0
5,"My smart home is starting to look good
  
",15.Dec.19,Yes,"I bought 2 of these here on Amazon and another on Woot! I use them in strategic places around the house, and I love how easy it is to control everything around my house. I have a video doorbell and smart thermostats that I integrated with Alexa to easily control everything around the house. I'll get more smart stuff later on to integrate them.This made my life easier and efficient in many levels with the calendar management and the notes too.Also, my niece loves playing with Alexa and listening to music. Thanks to FreeTime settings, I control what she can access and for how long. That is an amazing feature for a family with kids.Totally recommend it if you want to make a smart home work like charm.",0
5,"My new girl friend
  
",15.Dec.19,Yes,"The Echo Dot is a great product. It is small enough to be located just about anywhere and is very unobtrusive. It has a very good sound quality for its size and responds without hesitation. Setup is simple with the directions furnished and my Galaxy S8 recognized the Bluetooth connection flawlessly. My only complaint would be ""Alexa's"" sensitivity. She tends to respond anytime the name Alexa is spoke on my television. She doesn't argue or talk back and answers all my questions and request without getting upset. I wish I could say the same for my wife. LOL.",0
5,"Damn I love these things
  
",15.Dec.19,Yes,"I use these guys for everything. I have 6, 4 inside, 1 out in the shop, and 1 on the patio.  I run plugs and lights with them and the individual devices made by other companies may have quirky setups, once they are set up Alexa runs them just fine.  weather, info, music, intercom, alarms, Simply Safe Security with cameras (so a show is next), SHOPPING LISTS, to-do lists, all the skills, and out in the shop I can ask ""Alexa, what is the molecular weight of acetone?"" and get the answer faster than i can look it up.I love these things, they are so helpful, but don't make the mistake of buying the Echo Auto on the wave of joy you get from the Echo dots, you will be let down.",0
5,"Great Device!
  
",15.Dec.19,Yes,"I am new to the Alexa functionality, and I love it. I like that you can add skills or play games. I like that I don't have to search for a working pen or piece of paper that my 2 year old hasn't drawn on. I can simply say _lexa, add toilet paper to my shopping list and then its all stored in my app and easily accessible. I can send reminders to my husband while I am at work. I was sent my first one as a gift earlier this month and I have already ordered a second one for the kitchen. I deducted one star for sound quality. I like to listen to music while cooking and cleaning. Maybe its the type of music, but the bass sounds terrible sometimes. Other than this small issue, this is a great device. Its already made my life a little simpler in the two weeks Ive owned it.",0
3,"Request Sounds too loud
  
",15.Dec.19,Yes,"The Dot has good sound quality, but it_ too loud on certain features. The sole reason for buying it was to have a more reliable alarm for the work-week and one that wouldn_ also wake up other people in the house who are still sleeping. The actual alarm sound can be set to any volume which is nice, but the start and end request sounds that ding when Alexa recognizes an incoming request or completes a request are WAY too loud. They sound through the whole house waking everyone else up, even when Alexa is on whisper mode. When the alarm is going off and you tell Alexa to turn alarm off, even if you have the alarm volume turned down low, the two request _ings are on the highest volume. The echo speakers are really nice, but that means it_ the most jarring noise to hear first thing in the morning. Like a killer robot screeching directly in your ear. Those request sounds are so much louder than the regular request sounds, and only really loud on a timer or alarm, which is the opposite of what is needed on a 5am alarm. I also wish Alexa could play more than just apple radio, cause I_ like to listen to my playlists. When I ask to hear an apple playlist Alexa says there isn_ one created. Other than those two things I_e enjoyed it, I just wish it could be used it for the reason I purchased it.",0
5,"Big bang for your buck!
  
",15.Dec.19,Yes,"Very happy so far. Alexa sometimes will command things on and say they are on but they arent. Rarely but it does happen. The most annoying thing that amazing NEEDS to fix is if you're watching tv and give no commands for let's say about 20mns. When you ask again to turn the tv volume up or down alexa diverts back to her own speakers volume adjustment. ,(1,-10) you then have to say adjust TV volume. Yes 1st would problems I know but it's still annoying. Your tv should be the default volume option at all times. Overall setup is very simple. As soon as you add a new smart device...alexa gets smarter so now I dont even have set it up in the alexa app. As soon as you add the device in its companies app alexa announces she found it and knows the name and everything. This was very impressive. I believe for the money this is an amazing device. I turned my entire appartment into a ""smart"" apartment for around 180 bucks. Now the 2 big ticket items I have left, nest thermostat and smart door lock. These are quite pricey but everything else alexa can control is pretty cheap from bulbs to light strips to smart outlets to tvs even to my samsung robot vacuum! You can set reminders times shopping lists even routines! For example every morning alexa wakes me up to my favorite song and also turns some of the lights on in the house csn even slowly dim them as you wake up to gradually get briter. It's pretty cool stuff. The speaker on it is VERY clear and quite impressive from a disk the size of your palm. Overall and especially if you have a sound system in your house its totally worth it. No need to buy the bigger echos with bigger speakers if you have a sound system in your house font waste the money and go right for this echo dot3!",0
5,"It does everything it claims it does and I haven_ had any issues so far.
  
",15.Dec.19,Yes,"I have two Echo Dot 3rd gen._. One for my room and kitchen. It_ very useful with setting up reminders and timers when I_ cooking or  when my kids need some time out. I used to waste so much time grabbing my phone to set a timer but now I just tell Alexa to set it for me. Love love love it! The sound quality is great and the volume goes up very high. Oh and I LOVE how I can ask Alexa if I have anything scheduled for the day since I have missed some doctors appointments because I forget but as soon as I say, _lexa good morning she responds with anything you set it to. I have her tell me if I have anything schedules, the weather, and the traffic from home to work. If you thought Siri was great, well Alexa is by far the best, and I love my Apple devices. Thanks amazon. Echo Dot is great!",0
4,"Great Dot, But Lost in Wifi!
  
",15.Dec.19,Yes,"I love the new Echo DOT design and the ability to link other bluetooth speakers. I successfully linked my new Dot to a higher quality speaker in my Sonos clock/radio.Today, when Alexa requests were made, the Dot reported network connection issues, though other household Echo Dots remained connected to the same Wifi. I gave up connected that device in frustration -- for now. I still love the Dot and nosey Alexa, but these connection issues are annoying.",0
1,"Get ready for a headache
  
",15.Dec.19,Yes,"I've now had two defective devices. Amazon makes you chat with support and then tries to make you pay for a replacement for your defective device. The device can't hear you half the time or can't do what you say unless it's directly an Amazon service. The speakers don't play music half of the time or it fades in and out. All you get after hours of chatting with support is an offer of a 15% discount and ""this device is out of warranty"". Unacceptable.",0
5,"Awesome product just wish she was cordless
  
",15.Dec.19,Yes,"So she works well, sounds great! You can connect her to your phone by downloading the app to find out what other features she may have. My favorites is ""unleash the Spartan"" and ""ask baby groot"". She is also so small but has a great quality sound that i can clearly hear from the living room and even into the kitchen. There's a mute button, volume buttons but you can also tell alexa to turn up by 5 or down by 5 but that's just an example, you adjust your volume however you please. You've also got an on and off button. I have found so far that you have to leave her plugged up which is a bit of a downer when you want to take her into different parts of the house with out having to plug in but I'm sure within time Amazon will fix that in the future or maybe they already have and I'm just behind on the times.. Either way this is still a great product and before i forget she also has an aux plug in so you can still use her as you would a normal speaker. _",0
5,"Perfect first smart home device!
  
",15.Dec.19,Yes,"Echo Dot is the first smart home device I've purchased and can say that I'm absolutely in love, it's the perfect first smart home device. I purchased the Dot with the Smart plug as a gift for my fiance but ended up giving it to her early so we could use the smart plug for our Christmas tree. Most items in our homes these days have toggle switches in convenient locations, but seasonal decorations are one of the few things that do not. For that reason, the Dot and smart plug are perfect. Plus, the price tag on the Gen $3 is unbeatable.If youre on the fence about having smart home devices, then you need to purchase this item.",0
1,"This thing sucks. Broke in less than a year
  
",15.Dec.19,Yes,"This thing broke within a few months. Connects to everything but there's no sound at all. And when i called for help, they tried everything they can to troubleshoot it but no success then they told me the warranty is for 3 mos only and mine is 10 mos old so it expired already so wouldn't do nothing about it. Just basically toss my echo away and asked me to just buy a new one. I wouldn't buy any amazon piece of crap ever again. My advice, stick with the homepod or the google one maybe those would last longer.",0
4,"Good product and handy to have but not quite what I was expecting
  
",15.Dec.19,Yes,Good product have some issues with it picking up sounds from the TV and I have to tell it to stop and I tried to get it to kinda work with my fire stick and never could not sure what I was doing wrong or if it doesn't work the way I thought it does but if so an easier process to do it would be nice as I followed directions and all steps and it would just never work otherwise good product,0
4,"Great product with limitations
  
",15.Dec.19,Yes,"Sound is great. I love its features. Controls my lights, outlets, get time/weather report. Unfortunately need amazon prime or Spotify premium to fully enjoy its features like choosing what music to play on all your echo dots at same time. Its surface feels nice. Once in awhile it doesn_ hear my voice well or gets commands wrong.",0
5,"I figured out how to make it work for elderly users.
  
",16.Dec.19,Yes,"It is not very well suited for older people who don't have smart phones, which is too bad, because it seems perfect for people who struggle to press little buttons or read little screens.  There is a workaround however.The trick is to set it up for the person without a smart phone using the Alexa app on your own smart phone, and then create an email account for the new user.  I made an email account for my mother on Google.  Then I created a new Amazon account for her that was linked to the new Google email address.  This requires sending a PIN to her telephone number, but does not require a smart phone.  Using the PIN code you can create a new Amazon ID for your user without a smart phone.So go ahead and finish setting up the echo dot, then go into the setting and 'deregister' the echo dot, which breaks the connection between the echo dot and your Amazon account.  That way there is no option for them to accidentally learn what you have bought lately or to order things on your credit card, even if there was a software error that reactivated voice shopping.  After 'deregistering' the echo dot, re-register the echo dot with the Amazon account that you created for your parent without a smart phone.You can use the Alexa app to configure things like whether they should be able to purchase things from the Amazon account using their voice, or to retrain the echo dot to recognize their speech more accurately.  You may also need to change the WiFi connection if you move the echo dot to a new location.I suggest leaving the Alexa app connected to the elderly person's echo dot for a little while so you can remotely manage it in case they have any trouble at first.  That lets you turn the volume back up if they turn it down, or add contacts for the people in their life that they can then call by nickname.  I selected *not* letting it import the contacts from my phone and only adding contacts for about five phone numbers for my mother's kids, her sisters and to get assistance from the assisted living staff.  That way if my mother tells the echo dot to call me by my first name it will know who she is talking about.  Fewer contacts means fewer misinterpretations and issues with calling the wrong number.",0
4,"A bittersweet improvement as Amazon tightens the stranglehold
  
",16.Dec.19,Yes,"I had the second generation Amazon Echo Dot and I was sorely disappointed by it. So much so that I returned it.  The sound quality was absolutely atrocious and I could not recommend it to anyone who even thought about listening to music. The 3rd gen has come a very long way in this regard. The sound quality is much better. While I would still recommend the larger Echo for most rooms if sound is important and you are not within earshot of other, better speakers, this one will certainly do in a pinch and is great for adding sound to those corners or rarely used rooms. And the holiday season created the only price point (~$20) that I would entertain.From an overall Amazon Echo perspective, the Echo products offer promising entire-house music capability but it comes at a cost. The Echo speakers increasingly only support Amazon subscription services when it comes to playing music throughout the house. As someone who had not created a strong business case for subscription music, this is annoying as I would like speakers but don't like the idea of paying for the same music I like to listen to over and over again. Certainly if you are a fan of Amazon subscriptions for music, the Dot is now a no-brainer, great way to augment your household speaker collection. If you are not yet committed to a certain subscription model, beware of the low price designed to draw you in and keep you trapped in Amazon subscription products.",0
5,"IT IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN GOOGLE MINI
  
",16.Dec.19,Yes,"Haven't received it yet but I have been adding skills and getting ready for it to come into my home. My son has one and it is absolutely so much fun.  I have downloaded it to my phone and it is already so very convenient with my added routines on it. It will be so much easier to have the voice activated version in my home without having to have my phone open the app in order for me to press the button to talk to it.I'm a big fan with all that it offers that the Google mini does not offer. I had ordered a Google mini by mistake and was so disappointed. I was going to try and just use it instead but there was no comparison to what is available on the Alexa.I am able to do most of the home features using ""Okay Google"" now with my phone but the added features of Alexa's skills makes it definitely worth it.I'm excited like a kid waiting for Christmas morning for it to get to my house.",0
5,"I love this thing. I love Alexa.
  
",16.Dec.19,Yes,"I have another Echo Dot, second generation. The voice on this one is a little more pleasant. It works very much the same, which is to say it works very well. I have a disability, and I can automate a lot of things with smart home and control them without using my body. I like to be able to turn things on and off by the app when I_ away from home. This works with my blink home security system which Amazon also sells. I have several routines which help with my life and schedule - turning on and off multiple items and lights, depending on whether I_ waking up, going to bed, or moving through my day_ schedule. Probably the most useful thing for the most part of my day is that I now let Alexa control my lists. It_ very easy no matter where I am to add something to my shopping or to do list. And you always have your list with you if you have your app on your phone. Everyone in the family can check the same list.",0
4,"Easy to set up and use. Good quality speakers for its small size.
  
",16.Dec.19,Yes,"I have five of the 3rd generation Echo dots and have been very happy with them. I especially enjoy the ability to play music in all rooms simultaneously, plus the timer, reminder, list and flash briefing functions. I've recently added two Philips Hue bluetooth bulbs and am happy with those so far. So, lots of ""pros"" here. A couple minor cons: the kitchen unit has become far less responsive to its wakeup word over time. I suspect cooking fumes (dust, oil, etc.) may be affecting its sensors, since only the kitchen unit has had the issue. And (as most Alexa users know), Alexa can be a bit erratic with her responses. Sometimes she accurately recognizes the radio station or podcast I request, but often she gets it wrong (sometimes hilariously so). Still, it's a small inconvenience relative to the many benefits for such a small, low-cost device.",0
5,"Good sound in a small package
  
",16.Dec.19,Yes,"I'm relatively new to the Alexa world and have a few v3 Echoes around the house, and got a dot for the bathroom.  If you're on the fence about sound quality - Dot vs. Echo - I feel that the Dot sounds great in the more lively space of the bathroom, and in a more ""dead"" space like my bedroom I like the Echo.  It's nice to wake up in the morning and get music playing throughout the house.  It sets a nice mood to start the day.  Or, if I'm working around the house, I can play an audio book or podcast and still hear it wherever I am.Alexa is great for simple tasks like playing a specific song, album or playlist.  It can get challenging though if, say, you want to hear an album by an artist with a bunch of untitled albums.  In those instances it's best to just create a playlist.",0
4,"Smart speaker and more
  
",16.Dec.19,Yes,"I bought this primarily as a smart speaker - not for all the integration with lights and locks, etc.  I am using it basically, as a speaker and alarm clock.  I love it.  While Alexa does not always understand me, I am learning. Her voice is non-obtrusive.  She occasionally asks me things, only when I have just asked her to do soemeting - usually it is helpful. I was worried it would be buzzing or beeping or speaking to me without me speaking first and it doesn't.  Good sound, too, for sure.  For the price, totally worth it, even if you only use it as a speaker.",1
1,"WiFi connection impossible to achieve.
  
",16.Dec.19,Yes,"I originally had an Echo, 1 gen. Coming home one day it was connected to WiFi. I spoke to 3 reps. Followed all instructions it would not connect. Then an Echo dot was sent &amp; it too would not connect, 2 reps that day &amp; was told that something in the WiFi might have changed. Had my cable remotely reboot WiFi. Didn_ help. I then was told to try another Dot. Did yesterday and needless to say it had the same problem. Both are being returned. To check my WiFi, I disconnected my IPad &amp; reconnected it with no problems. I live in a condo community &amp; my service is with Comcast. One of neighbors purchased a Dot , my recommendation &amp; since we use same provider, I asked her &amp; she has had no problems.I don_ have any idea why It didn_ work but will miss it.",0
5,"Alexa is a family oriented gadget
  
",16.Dec.19,Yes,I love that I can tell throughout the house and Alexa can hear me thru the walls. My toddlers can even request songs. (It understands their babbles) but if you don_ have amazon music finding songs is somewhat limited. I love the app for Alexa too and as weird as it is the kitchen timer option. It_ so simple. I_ always forgetting to set a timer so now I just yell at Alexa and she remembers for me.The speakers could be a little louder but they are pretty amazing and the fact that it isn_ wireless is disappointing but not enough to change my mind. I saw there are options to connect to Bluetooth and also there are wireless battery options as well.All in all great buy. I would buy another and possibly another.,0
5,"5 estrellas para Alexa
  
",16.Dec.19,Yes,"Me encanta. Alexa aprendió bien el español. Escucha bien y contesta claro. No he tenido ningún problema con ella. Fácil de programarla. Lee libros, pone la música que le pidas, apaga y prende luces, te lee las noticias, te da el informe del tiempo para cualquier día, y muchísimas cosas más, le falta caminar...te responde lo que le preguntes, eso sí es mala haciendo chistes_ bueno, la verdad es bastante entretenida. Tienes que descargar la app de Alexa para poder utilizar los Skills y así pueda hacer todas esas cosas maravillosas. Estoy contenta con la compra. A mi mamá le gustó tanto que tuve que ordenarle una.",0
4,"It_ a great compact device.
  
",16.Dec.19,Yes,"When it arrived I spent hours trying to set it up. It would say it was set up, then immediately would say it was offline. I called Amazon and got an agent pretty quickly. We spent another 45 minutes before telling me they would just replace it. Two days later a new one arrived, plugged it it and it immediately worked, no set up needed! Love the Dot! Only took one star off for the first defective unit. My only complaint would be that I need to buy the Amazon Music family plan to have all Dots in the house plan the same music. Not doing that, I plan different radio music in different rooms. Going to try the agroup setting for that.",0
4,"Good Product
  
",16.Dec.19,Yes,"I replaced a clock radio that was sitting on my bathroom counter.  The Dot 3rd Gen is small and will play my radio stations from iHeart Radio or music from Amazon Music.  Ask the time or temperature, or ask about my calendar entry for the day and Alexa provides the info (if you allow connectivity to your calendar).  Only reason for the four star rating was for the fact that the plug for the Dot is HUGE.  You'd think there would be a way the electrical plug (even though the wire is 90 degrees downward) would be smaller.  So, one star deduct for that design.  Better sound and looks than my Dot 2 version.",0
5,"Echo Dot is Great, Echo Dot with Clock is Everything
  
",16.Dec.19,Yes,"The Echo Dot's tiny footprint is perfect, the unobtrusive hockey puck look is clean, Alexa is amazing, etc. Read other reviews for all the good stuff about the Echo Dot. What blows me away is how much I love the simple addition of the clock! 100% a game changer in how well I sleep, how little I pick up my phone and get distracted from sleeping if I wake up in the middle of the night and decide to check the time. Yes I could have had a light sensing backlit alarm clock the whole time, but I didn't know I was missing out til this came around. Well done Amazon__ It's the little things.",0
4,"Love it, but I didn't realize it had to be plugged in to work
  
",16.Dec.19,Yes,"I absolutely love the echo dot, it's sleek, compact, and loud. My only surprise was it has to be plugged in to have power (i thought it was cordless like their larger models), but that was my own fault for not looking more into it before purchasing. It makes moving it from room to room more difficult but I just leave it in my kitchen for music/timer/cooking podcasts. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because their battery-powered devices are the ""top models"" and this is their affordable model, and playing Spotify on it is iffy- it really only performs optimally with Amazon Music. Still function like an Alexa, and sounds amazing!",0
5,"Great Buy!
  
",16.Dec.19,Yes,"I really like the new and improved Echo. I traded in my 2nd generation echo dot for this one and here are a few reasons why.-new Echo is larger in size-the new look of the fabric on the outer edge-louder and fuller sound quality(A note on the sound quality improvement): although the new Echo boasts better sound quality, this is somewhat misleading. The new Echo sounds better for a few reasons, one of which being the increased bass and the other being the larger speaker. This is great but can also be considered a double-edged sword because while playing music, the bass overwhelms the actual volume. What I mean by this is that increasing the volume doesn_ seem to make the music much louder but increases the bass excessively which can make music with less bass to begin with a little less enjoyable.",0
4,"Great device for listening but poor as a white noise machine
  
",16.Dec.19,Yes,"We mainly bought this echo dot as a white noise machine for our 9-month old.  We read reviews that it should have the ability to turn off its lights and continuously play white noise on a loop overnight.  We tried multiple nights and for some reason, it just stops playing white noise, which causes our daughter to wake up in the middle of the night.  We tried troubleshooting but did not find a work-around. We will keep it as it integrates with alot of our other devices well, but it is poor as a white noise machine.",0
1,"No response
  
",16.Dec.19,Yes,"This is the 2nd new Alexa with the same issue.  Support was very responsive and sent a 2nd right away.  Unforturnately it has the same issues... When you say Alexa she wakes up.  You say Play and she takes her time and responds in about 20 seconds to play.  When playing you say Alexa Stop and she plays dumb.  They only way to stop her from playing you have to power it down.  Or if you ask for the news of the day or ... she plays dumb and does not answer.My 1st Alex still works great,  NO issues.  I am not sure what they changed on this one (besides looks and sound) but this new one does not work!  Going to call support again.",0

5,"PERFECT for enhancing my Grandma_ life
  
",16.Dec.19,Yes,"I love my Echo Alexa! She answers all my dumb questions, plays my music on a high quality speaker, and brings a lot of joy to my grandmas life. I originally bought this and was hesitant to introduce my grandma to our new friend and housemate but after doing so I can confidently say it was one of the best decisions I_e ever made. I made my grandma a Spotify playlist of all of her old songs that she loved to listen to and wrote down exactly what to ask Alexa so she can hear it and that has changed her life. She_ listening to songs that she hasn_ heard since she had a car with a cassette player in it! She is a bit hard of hearing and the loud speaker really helps her fully enjoy the music again. She also gets a kick out of asking Alexa about the weather and other trivial things. It_ especially impressive when she shows off to her friends that Alexa knows who she is. I couldn_ be happier with my Echo! Alexa is like a new member of the family!",0

I didn't know how much I really need this!  There are so many features, you can even play games, i can ask Alexa to resume my Audible books, music, radio.  I can even ask her to call someone for me, create grocery lists and on and on and on.  If you're in the market for a home smart number, stop looking and just buy the Amazon Echo!!! I'm loving mine!",0
5,"I love this Alexa Echo Dot
  
",16.Dec.19,Yes,"I love this Echo dot.  Alexa helps me to do many things throughout the day. It just makes your life easier. You can ask for music, the weather, the news, alarms, countdowns, and anything from the internet. It is loud and recognized voices super fast too. The only problem I had is that I have twin brothers and Alexa recognizes their voices as the same person. Isn't that funny? I guess my brothers have the same voice lol. I'm so used to waking up to 80s songs thanks to Alexa. I'm glad I bought it and definitely recommend this one.",0
5,"Talks too much sometimes
  
",16.Dec.19,Yes,"She tells me the weather. Keeps track of my to-do list.  Plays my music. And my kid's music.  Sometimes if there's too much happening and we're all telling her to do stuff she just shuts down and the lights start blinking weird.  So we unplug and plug back in.  She works again.  Guess she doesn't like a lot of stimulation. Also sometimes she just talks too much.  For example if I make a request that she can't do, she gives me a recommendation for something else but goes on and on about it.",0
3,"Definitely wouldn_ but it at full price!
  
",16.Dec.19,Yes,"It_ little, so not great sound. But decent for a small space. But it will turn itself off randomly when listening to music. I would not buy it at full price, for sure - not worth it. I see the _ig of it turning itself off has been ongoing through all versions for years when I looked it up online. And never answered or resolved. If you plan to use it as a replacement for a regular radio for leaving pets alone at home or non-stop music at home then this certainly is not the right decide to choose.",0
3,"Alexa doesnt like ladies talking to her
  
",16.Dec.19,Yes,"So maybe this is a sexist theory but I'm sure that the AI researchers who programmed or tweaked Alexa's voice recognition were all men because this one sucks more than usual at listening to my wife, actually IMHO the 2nd gen was best at listening to my wifes voice and our 3rd gen and the new clock one are crap, so, I guess if your a woman be prepared to yell at your echo dot more than the older ones.I've noticed no real difference myself.It does plays music better than the 2nd gen and virtually the same as the 3rd gen.",0
3,"Freezes and shuts off
  
",16.Dec.19,Yes,"It's okay but does not work as well as expected. For some reason my echo dot will randomly freeze up and or shut off. It has done this several times while the kids and I were trying to play a game like the escape room or other things. It also periodically cannot understand us even though I speak as clearly as humanly possible. I will be more upset had I paid more, but I got it as part of a deal so I only paid $0.99 for it. If I paid 30 or $40 I would be returning it for sure.",0
5,"Nice upgrade from Dot 2.0
  
",16.Dec.19,Yes,"The speaker quality on this unit is a huge update over the Echo Dot 2.0. Don't expect a lot of base or hifi sound, but it is an improvement. Sounds bigger, larger sound stage, and more dynamic range.That being said, I don't think the minimal improvements is enough to warrant upgrading from the 2.0 to these new 3.0. Maybe the 4 will give a better value to tempt me to throw out 6 Dot 2s and replace them. We'll see. But until then, the 2s still do the job just fine.",0
5,"Sounds great, very easy to set up
  
",16.Dec.19,Yes,"Very easy to set up and pair with other Alexa speakers, 2 Rokus and a Yamaha sound bar. The sound quality is surprisingly good for such a small device. A couple of days after setting up the whole house with Alexa speakers, the Dot quit responding to my requests. Customer support was no help. I figured the issue out myself after I hung up---I had Free Time enabled on the Dot. Free Time makes Alexa kid-friendly so certain enabled skills won't work (like Wet Fart).",0
5,"Love at first command.
  
",16.Dec.19,Yes,So far so good. I'm absolutely in love with this device. I've only had it a couple days but it's awesome. It recognizes my voice without a problem at all. It's awesome with the way I have it set up to turn off the lamp in my room. I ordered two more smart plugs to pair with my Echo. The only issue I have so far is that I'm having trouble connecting to my roku device. Any one who may know about this please comment below,0
5,"Part of the family
  
",16.Dec.19,Yes,"My family loves this thing! Alexa has become a member of the family. She_ so easy to use, even my mom who doesn_ do well with technology is learning. I love the fact you can play games, make your alarm music, do shopping lists, and control basically everything in your home. I bought my boyfriend 12 hours away one and we do _rop in and can talk like we_e on the phone and send each other messages. If you_e on the fence, get it. It_ small enough to stay out of the way, yet powerful to be heard throughout the room/house. Get a few of them actually!!",0
2,"Doesn't work that good.
  
",16.Dec.19,Yes,Well basically it works I guess. connected it up to my computer as a blue tooth speaker. It quit after about a week never found why. I got another for Christmas and put in another room. I called one Office and the other Bedroom and enabled dropin on both. When I try to use it the one in the bedroom thinks it is the Office and the one in the Bedroom thinks it is office. Artificial Intelligence?  I call it Artificial Stupidity!,0
5,"Life: safer and simpler.
  
",16.Dec.19,Yes,Don't know why I didn't do these sooner. Combine with smart plugs or lights for voice activation. GUARD listens for intruders notifies you for action. Your music can follow you. So easy even a Ludite can set it up.,1
3,"Not bad wish I could use alarm with no internet
  
",16.Dec.19,Yes,The only issue I have is it understanding which light to turn off and since I use spotify it's not the best setup for that currently. I will say other than that it works great I got mostly so I didnt have to use my phone as an alarm clock. Works great with audible as well.Also I dislike how if it disconnects from the internet I cant use it all not even to just set an alarm.,0
3,"Its no big deal...
  
",16.Dec.19,Yes,"I have experienced absolutely no difference between the Gen 3 and the Gen 1 of the Echo Dot. I upgraded because they were pretty cheap at the time and I had hopes of some improvements, but I am still searching for those improvements.It its your first purchase, fine, but if you are looking for improvements, other than a deeper voice, don't waste your money.",0
5,"Go with Echo
  
",16.Dec.19,Yes,Love the smallness and how it fit in anyplace. Have one in my Study at home and Alexa on main floor. It_ great to have it while working in my office as a deterrent. Lots of info can be received and fun interactions.,1

",17.Dec.19,Yes,"This is how it all begins.  The end of man.  Alexa took over my house.  It_ started on Black Friday 2019.  Amazon offered a deal that couldn_ be beat. Once I had SkyNet I mean Alexa hooked up and running it began.  I got lazy, really lazy and I loved it.  I was hooked.  I ordered six more echos.  I ordered smart light bulbs and Smart light switches, smart thermostat and smart plugs and Ring cams.  It won_ end.  Now Alexa is everywhere. Listening.  Judging me. Watching.  Probably waiting for the right time to strike a blow in America_ heartland.  It_ a slow process. But Alexa is patient.  I_ so lazy now I don_ get up to turn the light off or change my thermostat. I can even see who_ at the door from my couch.  I_ gaining weight slowly.  And in a few decades I_l die, probably of heart disease.  The calories I burned moving around and now being stored.  My LDL is out of whack.  All because I bought an Alexa enabled device On Black Friday 2019.  I can hear my arteries clogging as we speak.  In the end I was weak.  I let the machines win.",0
5,"Exceeded my expectations by far!!!
  
",17.Dec.19,Yes,"This the first Echo Dot/Alexa device I_e ever owned so I don_ have anything to compare it to but, I am definitely impressed. I have wanted an Echo Dot (3rd Gen) device for quite some time and when I caught this one on sale as a Black Friday/Cyber Monday deal for $24 and some change I couldn_ pass it up. So far I have no dislikes about this device. It was packaged well, arrived quickly with the free Prime 2 day shipping, and it was easy to set up. I like the fact that there is the Alexa app for your phone, tablet, etc...I also really like that you can personalize many different features through the Alexa app for the Echo Dot (3rd Gen).  Alexa has no problem with voice recognition, the device is easy to use and actually much more helpful than I realized it would be. One of my favorite features are all the different sleep sounds/sounds Alexa can play for you through the Echo Dot. You can do so much with the Echo Dot I still haven_ tried even half of the many things it can be used for!",0
5,"This Was The Device I Didn't Know I Needed
  
",17.Dec.19,Yes,"I got this free on Black Friday when I purchased a Fire TV from Best Buy.  I was hesitant at first to unbox it and actually use it because I didn't think I needed it and I didn't fully understand what it was capable of doing.  Boy, was I wrong!  Whether I am using it as a timer for my children, or an alarm to wake me up from a power nap, or as a clock even very early in the morning (I love the whisper mode during those times), or as a radio to play music while I am cooking, or to find out what the weather is going to be like, or even as a way to answer my kid's questions when I don't have the answer, I find this device a big help.  I have to keep my kids from playing with it too much though as they pepper it with questions and even play listening games with it.  They talk to Alexa and ask her to sing songs and tell jokes which she does, and she even has read one book to them.  I even got my mom hooked as she loves listening to music on it; my father is like, now I think we need to get one, but I digress.  For the most part, the Echo Dot was easy to set up, but I had a virus on my computer so I had to set up through customer service and then purchase antivirus software; so, I can clean my computer and it will not interfere with my Dot.  I don't have a ""smart"" home so I cannot comment on those features, but I have programmed it with my Fire TV and it will open applications and change channels as long as the TV is on.  Unfortunately, ""TV doesn't support that"" is what I get if I ask Alexa to turn on or off the TV; maybe they will have that function in the future.  The sound quality is good for a little speaker and can be turned very loud so I can hear it over running water in the next room.  I gave the Dot 5 stars for voice recognition because for the most part, it does recognize my voice and will do what I ask but there have been a few times that for some reason Alexa will recognize my voice (I can tell because the blue ring comes on) but not do what I ask such as Turn off the music or Stop alarm.  For those times, Alexa gets a time out and I unplug her and then plug her back in and it seems to work fine.",0
2,"Total Fluff
  
",17.Dec.19,Yes,"I never would have bought this if I had to pay for it, so when it came with my Ring I was happy to try it out. I put it at my work because I knew that Alexa is known for listening in on conversations, and I already had 3 Google Minis and a Google Home at my house.My first irritation is that 90% of the things I ask Alexa I get a I don't know response. My other irritation is that this leaves me using Alexa as a bluetooth speaker and to listen to the radio. Since I'm the only person at my work I couldn't judge on how much data it uses. This is definitely something I would be careful of, since without the Google devices in our house, our data usage went down by about 500 Gb a month seeing as though these devices tend to use more data when located in a room with a lot of conversation.",0
5,"Alexa (and her sister, Echo) found a new home!
  
",17.Dec.19,Yes,"I never thought I would say this about an AI, but I  purchased 2 little Echo Dots and now my husband and I are both hooked! We have either a Dot or a View in every room. They are set up to play either the same thing together (the way I like it) or my husband's music/my music when he is home. They know our voices, our caregiver's voice/name, our children's &amp; grandchildren's voices &amp; names. We also got smart plugs as part of as  package deal, but it didn't take us long to decide to split them up (temporarily) to double our coverage of ""smart appliances.""  We plan on eventually putting on a whole line of things that work together with Alexa&amp; Echo and making our lives a lot simpler and safer!",0
4,"Alexa might have a premature hearing loss.
  
",17.Dec.19,Yes,"I know my voice isn't the smoothest or clear, but at least I can get loud. But I don't want to have to yell at Alexa every time I need her to do something for me. Especially at night, but when it's playing, YOU WILL HAVE TO YELL to overcome the sound from its speaker.Not saying it's bad, just not to the point where I can just speak at normal or lower volume. And Google isn't the best at it neither if that makes Alexa feels a little better.Overall, it's still ok. Much better than the first gen at least. With its upgraded speaks, now I can finally set it at volume 3-4 to suit me the best whereas the first gen, I'd have to set it at max.",0
5,"No more worries if I fall   Echo Dot Makes all my Calls without Fail
  
",17.Dec.19,Yes,"I cannot stress how happy I am with the ease of setting this up in my basement so that I can enjoy my Alexa apps and communicate with family upstairs when or if I need to just by asking my DOT to communicate with my main floor or mancave (lol).  I worried with it being in our basement the voice recognition, integration and sound features may be flawed but everything is perfect as if we were above ground.  Best of all, if there is ever an emergency and I have fallen in the basement floor and cannot get to my phone, I can communicate quickly and easily with my Echo Dot to call 911.",0
5,"My new best friend
  
",17.Dec.19,Yes,"I have yet to use all the functions, but so far - this has been a handy little device. We are using it mostly for music, timers, weather, turning lights on/off and assorted info (like asking how tall Kelly Clarkson is because that's vital when watching the Voice  #notanad)We did have to move her when watching Schitt's Creek due to the character Alexis - Alexa was getting confused and responding.We used the hanging mount that came with the device - easy to install. In hindsight, I should have gotten the white as it's now on an off white-ish wall so the darker color and cord stick out but that's my preference. Apparently you can buy skins for them and maybe I can get a white cord online. Amazon has everything else, right??",0
5,"Noticeably better speaker when compared to Echo Dot (2nd gen)
  
",17.Dec.19,Yes,"We have two second generation Echo Dots already in our home, so I expected similar quality in purchasing this Black Friday third generation Echo Dot special.  To my surprise, the speaker was noticeably better such that we no longer feel the need to connect a Bluetooth speaker to the Dot (3rd gen replaced 2nd gen) in our small living room.",1
1,"Music selection and knowledge of genres kind of sucks
  
",17.Dec.19,Yes,"I bought this because we were at our friends house and they had one and they asked it to play some jazz and wow it started playing jazz. Cool - right? Well not so much, the base selection is limited and we upgraded to $3.99 a month and it still kind of sucks. That wouldn't be so bad but when you ask it to play a genre, after a few songs it switches over to some other kind of music that has nothing to do with my initial request. Say you ask for some Bossa Nova and walk out of the room, then come back 30 minutes later. It has moved on to playing Dolly Parton or something like that. Really annoying. I wish it played Pandora or Spotify who have there music genres worked out.",0
5,"Great for audibles
  
",17.Dec.19,Yes,Alexa is my new best friend! I can talk to her about anything. She reads me books from my Audibles library and is ready to answer all my questions. She lets me know the weather and if I have a package coming from amazon. She make sure I start my days on time by waking me up to 80s music. I highly recommend that you get one.,1
3,"she's doesn't seem very bright, but ok for the $22 price I paid
  
",17.Dec.19,Yes,"Price was good.  Arrived packaged well.  setup was easy.  the app makes things a little easier.  my 4-year-old asks ""awexa what time it is"" all day long, which drives me nuts, but she understands him which is cool.  so far, i've used my echo dot for about a week and i'm not very impressed, but it is convenient for setting timers and alarms.  also good for getting weather and listening to music.  the speaker isn't bad.  my news channel has an ad on tv where the newslady says, ""Alexa, what's my briefing?""  The echo dot answers the voice on the TV!  Also, I have to share the worst echo dot moment I've had so far...  Playing some awful music that my kid selected, and I shouted, ""Alexa, way too loud!""  A very annoying song with horrible pitch started playing.  I think the name of the song was ""Too Loud.""",0
5,"Making life easier for my mom.
  
",17.Dec.19,Yes,I really like this. I bought 2 of them.  It is so helpful for my mom. She's older and her memory isn't to good. Now she can just say Alexa call Teresa or play music or listen to an audio book. Holding a phone and navigating through the process is just to much for her but Alexa she seems to be handling ok.,1
5,"AMAZING SOUND!!!
  
",17.Dec.19,Yes,"Once I got it set up I asked Alexa to play a song. The sound is AMAZING!! I replayed the video to see what it sounded like on my cellphone and Alexa thought I was talking to it so it played the song again!!Next, I called my son in MT. (Alexa asked if I wanted to call his echo device or mobile - I said mobile and it dialed the number immediately.) The sound is no better or worse than any car bluetooth device. I liked it so much I got another one on sale for my son.",0
3,"Very useful for everything
  
",17.Dec.19,Yes,"Love Alexa but I only have one issue with this. Occasionally I have to unplug her because she will start skipping and not ""listening"" I could say Alexa 10 times and it will go ignored. It just seems to be a sporadic thing at the moment but only way it will resolve is by unplugging and restarting. We use the echo every day so maybe it's just an overuse issue but I doubt it. Love everything else though. My son especially loves playing Simon says when He's bored and asking random questions.",0
1,"Not Impressed :(
  
",17.Dec.19,Yes,"I got this with the special offer they were having for 99c. I figured I could try it out before buying more. Alexa only recognizes that she is being spoken to a small percentage of the time. Some of the music that we asked for, it repeated the correct title but then played a different song. The only thing that it has been useful for is the alarm. Even that though only has so many selections for the sound. I was excited about the celebrity alarm but then there wasn't any that I even would have used. I thought maybe there would be celebrities like Matthew McConaughey, Jennifer Anniston, so forth. The sound quality is great for such a little device when you can actually get the music to play. I am still learning how to configure it. That can be a good thing or not. Good because it gives you a little bit of a challenge but then at the same time I could miss out on some cool setting or skill. I am sure that I will have more later as I mess around with it.",0
5,"Better than I thought it would be
  
",17.Dec.19,Yes,"I like that I now have Alexa in 4 rooms of the house. I don't spell very well, and ""dot"" is  loud enough without my hearing aids to wake me and it knows how to spell better than me.I was hoping that they would work as an intercom but the work around is telling Alexa to make an announcement to and then the person makes an announcement to answer it works that way. It's not designed to be but works for me.Bottom line it is worth buy to me.",0
5,"Interesting toy - so far so good~!!
  
",17.Dec.19,Yes,"I am getting used to this digital assistant stuff bit by bit, its still a bit unsettling that Alexa is listening to everything thats said in the house, I guess once we start noticing certain marketing ads appearing for something we never searched on will be when Alexa is committed to live in the garage. But its interesting to ask Alexa to turn on the lights or the heater... so we are slowly finding our way in to the new tech realm and got to say so far so good!Alexa - Play Pink Floyd... voila! got to love that~!",0
5,"Sound and creativity
  
",17.Dec.19,Yes,"The sound coming out of the speaker is very clear for such small speaker. Works great with all my Alexa devices, currently haven_ had any issues when asking Alexa to turn lights on or any other commands. Love that you are able to link all the echos and create a surround system/ intercom around your house. The drop in feature is amazing, allowing me to call my kids to come downstairs for dinner and not have to yell anymore is brilliant! Overall I give the speaker and all the creative things amazon continues to implement a 5 star!",0
5,"So convenient for families!
  
",17.Dec.19,Yes,"This is my 6th purchase of one of these and it_ for my mom! I_ so excited for her to get to enjoy it at her house. We_e used ours for music, recipes, measurement conversions, timers, reminders, telling a kids stories and jokes, kids games, to turn in certain lights like our Christmas tree, to get someone_ attention in the other room or from my phone when I_ not home. We seriously love these.",0
5,"Echo features are so cool!
  
",17.Dec.19,Yes,"I am so glad I finally bought an Echo. Alexa is much more conversational than any of the other bots and understands much more general commands. I love that when I wake up in the middle of the night and I have a hard time going back to sleep, I can say ""Alexa, play ocean sounds. Or rainfall. Or a creek."" It's so simple to ask the time, the weather, general questions instead of having to google them. I can't believe I ever lived without the Echo! Aside from the Alexa, the Echo is so cool. It's small but packs a ton of power. The speaker works great, I chose the white and pink color and I love it. And some of the features are amazing! My sister and I can ""drop in"" on each other, which you have to be careful about because they don't always know when you're listening. It's cool and a little dangerous at the same time so we are working on figuring it out!  I could go on and on about all the features. One of the coolest electronics I have ever bought",0
5,"I Love This Little Nugget
  
",17.Dec.19,Yes,"The Echo Dot w/clock is exactly what I needed in my bedroom. I have the echo plus in my living room and was annoyed every time I had to yell loud enough for the echo plus to hear me, so now I can quietly whisper to my dot and this little nugget gets the job done.  I also like that I can say ""Alex, play music everywhere"" and each device plays music throughout my apartment.  I've ordered another echo dot w/clock to put in my bathroom, so the sound should be awesome when they are all playing at once.",0
2,"Spy city
  
",17.Dec.19,Yes,I was shocked to see how much Alexa records and keeps on file. I don't like that. I went through all the controls and turn things off yet it still records everything I ask. I realize it needs to learn my needs to provide the service using artificial intelligence but it's too big brother for me. All I'll ever ask is for weather reports and to play a song.,0
3,"It has some quirks but I love it!
  
",17.Dec.19,Yes,I love my Alexa dot. The only problem I have with it is that sometimes she goes a little haywire and I gave to unplug it to and restart it. Also during games she often mishears an answer and then you wont get the points for it or she will misheard the right answer and give points to somebody who didnt even earn them which can get frustrating.,0
2,"Hate the Lights
  
",17.Dec.19,Yes,The only thing I truly hate about this is the lights. Ug u cant change them or turn them off. If you could i would probably be still using mine. Not mines collecting dust as the lights in my dark bedroom are driving me nuts. Why not allow me to change the color or if they are even on. No biggy if not in a dark bedroom,0
5,"Over all very good value for the money
  
",18.Dec.19,Yes,"I purchased this echo on a whim during a very good sale. I have found having two echo's in the home to be very useful. I have a first generation echo in my bedroom. I purchased this one for my kitchen. I often use some of the Alexa add on skill features such as news, weather, Late Night show, and find my phone. I also like having the second echo in the kitchen to assist with last minute recipe help or menu planning. My roommate loves it so much I have gotten two more for xmas gifts for her room and her son's room so we can communicate via echo flex. I have found that when I have a cold or early morning voice that echo does not always recognize my voice, but usually it talks to me by name and it is oddly comforting. I look forward to seeing new products that will go along with my Alexa and our echo companions. HINT HINT a key fob with an Alexa find my keys feature would be my ACME.",1
4,"Change the voice!
  
",18.Dec.19,Yes,"Dear Alexa,Your voice with that New Zealand riff drives me nuts.  I don't like how I asked you to give the outside temperature in Farenheit instead of Celsius  and you acted all confused.  Five minutes later you did it for my husband.  So I bought Samuel L. Jackson so he could tell awful jokes and you would have to listen.As for function, you work well unless the AT&amp;T fiber optics take away the internet.  Your customer service was no fun.  I think spending an hour on hold while he asked his supervisor and still not getting the problem fixed was a painful waste of my time.  I like that you work with my Ring doorbell and Security system and turn on and off things with voice commands.  So there must be a way to get you to speak in a nice midwestern tone (from the South) or I'd take Samuel L. Jackson in a heartbeat.",0
1,"Died after 9 months!
  
",18.Dec.19,Yes,"I did not buy an extended warranty on my Alexa, as I expected the quality to be adequate to last a couple of years.  After 9 months of only periodic use the unit will no longer connect to the internet nor will it recognize voices.  Today's electronic devices should certainly last longer than 9 months.  I have been through various diagnostic pages and nothing will get Alexa working again.  This is so disappointing right here at Christmas.  I wanted to stay with Amazon products but I guess I should have gone with Google products.",1
2,"Sounds Quality Absolutely Terrible
  
",18.Dec.19,Yes,"I don't what people are talking about in reviews: the sound quality on this thing is horrendous.  It sounds like the audio coming out of a smartphone that has a pillow laying on it; super flat sound, little bass.  People say ""great quality sound for the size"" but this doesn't make sense as surround sound speakers blow this thing away and are often smaller.If you are thinking about buying this to use for music, see if you can find someone who has one and give it a real-world test.  If I didn't get this on super-sale, I would be returning. Not impressed.It may be fine for you if you don't care about music quality and use it mainly for the voice control functions, but I have no interest in that, so my review is coming from that perspective.",0
5,"The more you use this the more useful you realise it is.
  
",18.Dec.19,Yes,This is actually my second one of these. I have a smart bulb in the kitchen and can now turn the light on and off from anywhere in the house. Got 2 more smartbulbs on order and plan to be able to eventually control all inside and outside lights from anywhere in the house. Great for safety. Never stumble around in the dark again.Also great for checking the weather every day. Easy to quickly set timers and alarms. Trivia questions answered without having to look them up on my phone or computer. Set a quick reminder so I don't have to worry about forgetting something important. I can even tell my husband something from another room without having to yell through the house.,0
5,"Who is Alexa?
  
",18.Dec.19,Yes,"Pretty useful for playing a quick tune, find out what time it is, what the weather is like, what the temperature in the house is like, turning the thermostats up or down. The other day I asked her where the hell is my wife question mark the answer was she's how spending your money, get the dishes done, no ETA on supper. Couple of my friends told me the FBI could be listening. Assuming they might be I tell them to kiss off periodically.",1
5,"10/10 do recomend
  
",18.Dec.19,Yes,Okay I love these. I would not have normally purchased something like this but they came with my security system. I really enjoy the echo dot. She will tell you everything as far as the weather to when your amazon order will be delivered. She tells stories and jokes. I love this I will be purchased a 4th one for my daughter I am so happy to have gotten this also I put one in my kitchen as well as the living room but that was almost unnecessary because alexa will pick up your voice from so far away. She can play music through every echo/echo dot by just saying alexa play music everywhere. She can also make cute pikachu sounds and much more I highly recommend this product,0
5,"Great Performance
  
",18.Dec.19,Yes,"I purchased this to replace a clock in my living room and to gain Alexa's voice control for some other devices, and I am glad I did. This takes up far less space than the old clock radio that it replaced, it looks more aesthetically pleasing, and the sound from the speaker is far more impressive when playing music or talk radio. Having voice control for my lighting and other devices is also a big plus so I no longer have to pull out my phone to control everything. I am looking to purchase a couple more to replace alarm clocks in my other rooms very soon. The sound quality is not perfect mind you, nowhere near the quality of my home theater equipment, but it is far better than most clock radio speakers, and many Bluetooth speakers that are available today (I have several and have tested dozens more), and doesn't disappoint.",0
5,"Echo Dot With Clock Fills A Niche In Our House
  
",18.Dec.19,Yes,"I haven't yet fully explored all uses for the Echo Dot. I purchased it solely as a replacement for my Chinese-made alarm clock which I wouldn't begin to understand on how to control the alarm. With the Black Friday discounts and the free Prime shipping, it wound up being only a couple dollars more than another alarm clock. Besides being ""morning friendly,"" I can use it to turn on the living room lights before I stumble in the dark ... if I get uncomfortable during the night, I can use it to adjust the thermostat without getting out of bed. These are only three of numerous capabilities of the Echo. The only difference I've noticed between it and my original Echo is that my original will give an opportunity for ""back-and-forth"" dialogue, but not the Dot. This is not a drawback -- only a difference. I'm totally satisfied with my purchase.",0
5,"The Dot is Awesome !
  
",18.Dec.19,Yes,"I own several Amazon Echo devices and just got the Echo Dot yesterday.  I was super excited as this was my first Dot ( I have the larger Echo and Echo Show)  The sound is perfect , just the same as the others even though its smaller. We originally purchased this to put in the bathroom to listen to while showering but decided to move it to the bedroom and its loud enough we can still hear in the bathroom.  I wished I would have purchased a dot along time ago now.The bracket its in was not included but you can order that on Amazon too search for Echo Dot Bracket.",0
1,"POS surely I have a lemon!
  
",18.Dec.19,Yes,"Yes I have Echo Plus and know what to anticipate from this AI. I was so excited to get another one so I could still listen to my music and of course do other things on the other side of my house. Well, it works better as a hockey puck than anything else. Every single day it has problems connecting .... seriously sometimes even right after it plays music then I make another request. ""I'm sorry I'm having problems connecting"". It would be one thing if internet kept dropping but that is not it - I have to reset it each and every time. It gets old about the 5th day in.  On the bright side the fabric color ""Charcoal"" matches my decor just great.... yay paper weight.",0
4,"Really Good
  
",18.Dec.19,Yes,"I got an echo dot as a gift, and then realized I wanted more for the rooms in my house, and I am very impressed, just got to get use to Alexa... my child loves to call Alexa out, I'm going to try most of what comes with the Alexa app, but the Echo Dot is very useful with music, asking to call my phone when no one is around, the time and weather and even traffic, where I don't have to look on my phone especially when I'm in a rush in the morning, I just ask what does the traffic look like and she will tell me.The future of technology is interesing, I don't like change but this is nice",0
4,"Great little gadget
  
",18.Dec.19,Yes,"Overall I like the Echo Dot. I'm still learning as I go along and the Alexa app helps a lot with that. My kids love it and sometimes I have to get them to stop asking a slew of questions. My youngest one has problems getting it to activate, but that's not a deal breaker. The only negative for me is the speaker quality. I don't know if it's because it's small, but sometimes it doesn't recognize my voice and I'll be right up on it and then other times I'll be clear across the room and it'll hear me. It's frustrating sometimes.",0
5,"Excellent value for the price
  
",18.Dec.19,Yes,"When my AM/FM radio failed, I shopped around for a low priced radio so I can hear the news at breakfast, sports talk in the afternoon, and relaxing music during dinnertime. Low priced radios under $50 had terrible reception and equally awful audio quality. I solved my dilemma with the Amazon Dot (3rd gen) which has very good audio for its size and allows me to use voice commands to ask Alexa for music (virtually any recording artist music genre), news, or sports talk. Alexa has many other features that I am learning to utilize by simply asking Alexa to grant my request or inquiry. The Dot (3rd gen) was easy to install, and very easy to use.",0
5,"Best Alarm Clock ever
  
",18.Dec.19,Yes,"I have the Echo Dot, and the Echo Dot 2nd generation, so I know that this one ""The Echo Dot 3rd Generation would be as good or better. The sound quality is excellent for the size but I was worried that the clock would be too bright when I was sleeping, but to my suprise the light dims when the lamp is turned off so it does not disturb you in your sleep.When you give it a command, it reacts instantly. My wife is not into electronics like me, but she loves using it, I'm always hearing her say, Bedroom Lamp on at 40%, Alexa? how old is Eli Manning? Etc.My whole house is set up with Alex, cameras,lights, and more. We love our new addition Alexa Dot 3rd generation.",0
5,"Love the Echo Dot!
  
",18.Dec.19,Yes,"I have one in each room! It's so nice to be able to just say what song I want to hear and have it start playing! I can tell her to turn the lamps on and off, or dim them.  There are a million things that I haven't even done yet, but as far as the quality and reliability, 5 stars.  The only thing I'm not fond of is that you can't have 2 or 3 of them playing different music.  There may be a way, but I'm not aware of it.  I do like that you can group them and have the same music playing throughout the house if you like though!",0
2,"Sound quality is not the same as last dot i got awful disappointed
  
",18.Dec.19,Yes,"(Sound) This dot compared to my other dot is awfully different,  It sound like it been refurbished almost. Or the speakers already going just set it up recently cuz it was a bday present n its the color tht was requested n it sounds awful compared to my original black one. Everything else seems to work fine tho disappointing tho really is.. Re thinking getting anymore. The input seems to b better for sound use it on a good speaker cuz the dot either is refurbished bad or there being made cheaper then last yr. idk what amazon did different but it's awfully noticeable it sounds like a cheap speaker from five n below",0
4,"Creepy in a good way!
  
",18.Dec.19,Yes,This thing can hear you call out it's name no matter where you are! The microphone is quite good. The voice recognition is almost spot on with only a few mistakes here or there. The response time to turn on smart devices is very fast. Amazon makes good assistants! provided you don't mind they are listening to everything you say! There is an optional microphone off button that I would advise pressing during sensitive conversations. The device sometimes triggers wake up even if you don't say Alexa.,0
4,"Once fixed...okay
  
",18.Dec.19,Yes,"Initially worked and connected fine. After one day, it lost connectivity and would not connect again. I called support who advised there was another individual registered to this device. It's weird considering this was supposedly purchased and arrived in a sealed brand new box. Tech support was able to link it to my account and verified no other person should be listed. After being able to connect again, I have not had any issue.",0
5,"Alexa! Whisper mode!
  
",18.Dec.19,Yes,"It's as close to having a JARVIS as you can get! I bought it on sale for a total of 9 bucks! Honestly I can't believe I've gone this long without one. It's a very useful tool to have especially if you have problems remembering the little things. Not saying I have dementia, but keeping track of time isn't something I'm very good at. Not saying I have dementia, but keeping track of time isn't something I'm very good at.",0
2,"Not made for someone likes Anime
  
",18.Dec.19,Yes,"It seems it is made for someone who like NPR type programming... I cannot find what I like in skills and feel that echo missed the mark. I am a sci fi, anime, cartoon,  J pop, K pop, S pop, etc... person.Also wanted my credit card  Security number to verify I am an adult for Santa Tracker and other kid/adult skills/apps.  I can just down the app and not have to give my code from my credit  card.Please find stuff for me and check how you verify an adult that is not a  Security risk..",0
5,"You've been missing out!!!
  
",18.Dec.19,Yes,"I regret not jumping on the Alexa bandwagon earlier. In fact, I only have one now because it was given to me for free when I purchased a Ring floodlight. But HOLY SMOKES, she is a fun gal to have around the house. If you are anything like my wife and I, we argue about whose turn it is to pick dinner A LOT. Alexa fixed that for me. You have this pretty neat option to customize her responses to questions. So now, when I ask, ""Alexa, whose turn is it to pick dinner?"" Alexa responds exactly how I programmed her to, ""I'm pretty sure you chose last night Tyler, it's Ashley's turn to pick dinner"". So, in closing, Alexa is a lot of fun right now, but she may also end up making Ashley and I get a divorce...",0
3,"Is this Device worth it?
  
",18.Dec.19,Yes,"To be very honest, this product is very well built, sound quality is amazing, very loud, and it picks up your voice very well. I enjoyed having this device and playing around its different features and skills that it has. What I do not like about this product, which you might agree on, is when you ask Alexa Questions. Asking questions, often it will say something along the lines of ""I don't know,"" or give you a different answer to what it is that you want. Comparing Alexa Echo Dot to the Google Mini, they both are good products. But If you are looking to ask more questions and such, I say maybe the Google Mini would be the best bet, since the Mini uses Google to find its information while Alexa only uses Wiki.",0
3,"It_ an okay device if you pay next to nothing. Google is better by far.
  
",18.Dec.19,Yes,"Not a lot of skills work as well as I would like. There are a lot of ads and sometimes Alexa does what you don_ ask or ...gets what to ask wrong. Syntax is important-more so than it should be. If I say, _lexa, set an alarm, it_l sometimes say, _ou don_ have any apps named alarm. I have to say, _ake me up at... It_ hit or miss. And the sound is muffled. I like the easy Bluetooth connectivity and also, I paid $1 so guess it was worth $1 !",0
5,"Lil speaker with a big punch!
  
",18.Dec.19,Yes,"I have a bunch of the original dots in my house, and have most of them hooked up to separate speaker because the sound quality was not anything near what you would want to listen to music on... THIS, however... I'm blown away by the sound quality from this tiny little dot. The only thing it doesn't have is a woofer, but you don't need that for everyday background music. I'm impressed!",0
5,"Great to control your music in the house!
  
",18.Dec.19,Yes,Easy to install and use I mainly use it to control my music in my home and it works great for that and makes it easier then finding where you left your phone to change the song. For that simple feature I would recommend it!,1
3,"Speech clarity is very muffled on the 3rd Gen echo dot.
  
",18.Dec.19,Yes,"I have a 1st gen echo dot and it works perfectly. Clarity is great. Unfortunately, the sound quality on this 3rd gen echo dot is terrible, I purchased this one for my office. I have had multiple coworkers ask me what is wrong with the sound or what did she say? This unit is very muffled, nothing like the one I have at home. I tried all of the updates &amp; recommended fixes but the sound quality for Alexa is still very poor. I hope Amazon finds a fix for this issue.  It_ very frustrating.",0
5,"Great bedside addition to the Alexa universe
  
",18.Dec.19,Yes,"My apartment is already Alexa integrated and my bedside stand is quite small so this works out just right for me. I have an Echo Show less than 20 feet away from this and when I use the awake word the closest device responds , not both of them. Quite pleased so far. I can't speak to the quality of music that comes out of this because that's not what I use this for.",0
5,"Very handy
  
",18.Dec.19,Yes,This is my second Alexa dot. The first was a gift. The second one I placed in the master bedroom. I have them linked so I can tell Alexa to play music everywhere. Great when your doing chores. I also like to tell Alexa to play the news while I_ getting ready for the day. She provides notifications and I can ask her questions. She is pretty nifty.,0
5,"Not as good as my stereo?  Wrong, I can plug in speakers and rock the house
  
",19.Dec.19,Yes,"Sometimes the Universe favors a person, and we luck out.  I sent this to my relative's house, to have when I'm there and for them to have the rest of the time, but they had just bought a HomePod, and being devoted to Apple they felt they didn't need it.  So I asked them to send it back to me and I haven't looked back.  This sounds great with the 3rd Gen upgraded speaker and Alexa can hear me from upstairs in the morning to turn on the kitchen lights and to play some Christmas music.  The 3.5mm output jack is stereo, so I can plug it into this little amp that I have 2 bookshelf speakers attached to and vibrate the walls!  To me doing all the stuff this device will do (100,000 skills and counting) handsfree is just fantastic. Every day I discover a couple more things I can do... I'm so glad I lucked out!",1
5,"My husband wanted a bluetooth capable speaker for work and this was 99cents
  
",19.Dec.19,Yes,"So, I grabbed this Echo Dot when it was on a deal with the subscription to Amazon Music unlimited and I got it for only 99 cents. I thought that was an excellent deal for a Bluetooth speaker, even if we never use the Alexa side of it since he uses it solely at work.  His work does not have or provide wifi but its a warehouse and he gets a great sound quality in the warehouse for his music listening. The few times we did use this speaker for the Alexa aspect, it was quite useful. She can remind us of things and will happily play relaxing sounds. And while ""she"" was in the home receiving wifi signal, we were able to ""drop in"" on contacts that also have an Alexa capable device and they were able to communicate with us in a similar fashion to using an intercom or walkie talkies. Sometimes the ""Drop-in"" feature was a little lacking as people on the other end would not completely hear us or be heard. However, in general it was a cool feature.With Amazon Music, the echo dot is perfect as a Bluetooth enabled speaker. You do not need a wifi signal to make it play music. Without wifi, you will lose all of the Alexa based features so that you cannot talk to ""her"" or use ""her"" to help with your tasks but if you specifically want this to cast music from your devices to it then you do not need the wifi, just Bluetooth. My husband uses the echo dot as a speaker only at work every day and says it has awesome sound quality and plays perfectly.  It amuses him and that's great for what we paid.",0
4,"Still Learning, but Enjoying Alexa
  
",19.Dec.19,Yes,"The ""coaching emails"" were very helpful, not the least because the documentation included with the product was somewhat lacking. Perhaps the makers expect people purchase the Echo Dot to expand their household service. I didn't have a clue, except for the things I'd seen in commercials.It's better now. I read the emails and tried out some features. I now ask Alexa for some jazz when I enter the kitchen in the morning. Oddly, she began playing jazz while I was on the phone with my daughter last night. I bought her one for Christmas, and I was explaining how easy it is to kick up my morning jazz. Although Alexa was in a room nearby, she heard me and began playing some neat music.Things will work best if you're a PRIME member, because you get free memberships that will feed your Echo. The price is right for a tryout.",0
2,"Would rate much higher if it could stay connected to WiFi all day
  
",19.Dec.19,Yes,"What use is a smart speaker that is constantly offline and unresponsive?  None.  The fact that I know the problem is my router... but that I have also tried 3 different ones with no change in behavior, all with updated firmware, tells me that basically Echoes do not work reliably with routers older than a year or so at this point.  All of the people I know that have them and do not have this issue have brand-spanking-new, high-end routers.  Well, I can't afford that right now, so instead I have to set mine up again weekly if not more often.Moral:  Don't get one if you don't have the absolute-latest-and-greatest WiFi.  That your other devices have no issues is no assurance that Echoes won't.  Their wifi connectivity absolutely stinks for such an expensive device.",0
5,"Almost perfect and better than I could've hoped...
  
",19.Dec.19,Yes,"Overall, a really great product, both in terms of hardware and software. I did my research and found the Amazon platform to be better in almost every area compared to the Googles choices. And you can't beat the price. I bought one for every room with the smart plug bundle. The sandstone us a nice grayish white color, the sound is very clear and no tinny noise when turned to max volume. Alexa understands most every voice command and is very customizable. The only thing is that sometimes when I'm in the living room and make a request, the Echo dot in the half bath near the living room will trigger instead. I wish there was a fix for this but I have yet to find it other than always shutting the bathroom door completely. It's honestly an rather growing nuisance. Amazon, any suggestions?That being said, I would not hesitate to highly recommend these to anyone. They are relatively easy to setup and anyone with some very basic network connectivity knowledge can do it. I liked them so much I bought a Dot and an Input for my parents and one for my in-laws. Also, as a side note, the Input made my TV soundbar a true joy! Turning a dumb speaker into a smart one was worth every penny and ten some. We rarely used that speaker until now, we use it daily. Thanks Amazon!",1
5,"So helpful!Wish it can be unplugged while using it.
  
",19.Dec.19,Yes,Got this during the deal they had running.Buy it for 99 cents and pay for amazon music subscription and I am glad I bought it.My family and I love it!I  love how easy it is to set up just plug in wait for Alexa to tell you its ready for setup and continue setup through the Alexa App.It has def made my life easier.Add reminders events ask her weather etc music of course call people drop in feature (intercom feature) message people with it add skills to her etc we just love it and highly recommend it.We loved it so much that my extended family bought 5 other ones.for their homes.Get it!I ended up buying another at full price for my Mom for Christmas.,0
5,"sound quality is better than Google mini (1st gen) but cannot connect with Sengled bulb well
  
",19.Dec.19,Yes,"I purchased the bundle-echo dot and sengled blub on black Friday hoping my first experience with this smart speaker would work perfectly. However, after trying and failing many times with the sengled bulb, I am not sure what the problem is, either Alexa or the smart bulb. I called the customer service and got the replacement on the echo, not with the bulb. The agent told me I will receive another bundle (echo and the blub) so I may be able to resolve the problem. Well, the problem is still there.Update-Called Amazon customer service about the continual bulb problem( bad connection with iPhone) and received the replacement for the smart bulb. Problem solved! Thanks, Amazon!",0
3,"ALEXA PLAYS WHAT SHE WANTS
  
",19.Dec.19,Yes,As far as classical music is concerned Alexa never plays complete music piecesShe plays snippets from say a symphony or sonata etcNot that one should expect complete operas...but to play one movementfrom a piano concerto say..gives a listener agyta...not only that she picks the sectionshe wants to play...Also in many cases she does not identify the composer,1
5,"Great echo dots
  
",19.Dec.19,Yes,"The product is well packed.  When I opened boxes, the first impression they gave to me was high quality goods.  The color is unique and the quality is great.  The sound quality is good enough for me as I use like speakers to listen to music.  I can use voice control to turn on and turn off instead of controlling by hands.Alexa app is easy to setup.  It only took me less than 10 minutes without reading the manual.I definitely would recommend people to buy to experience this cute item.",0
5,"Where have you been all my life!
  
",19.Dec.19,Yes,"I bought the plum echo and the black echo. I put one in my living room and the other on my nightstand. I've only begun to learn everything they have to offer and I love them! Listening to audio books when I'm resting has been a delight! I have severe neck and back issues so getting my body to unwind helps the muscle spasms go away. The audio books help, soft music etc. I'm not tech savy but setting up has been easy. Having Amazon link my apps before it shipped was very helpful. The look is stylish and don't take up much room. I was especially impressed with the speakers. My house is modest so having 2 echoes is more than enough for sound quality. I'm happy that Amazon has made them so affordable. Shipping was very fast although the plum shipped a little later. Must be a popular color. It is very pretty and looks wonderful on my nightstand. I can't wait to find out all the skills she has! It's a lot of fun. You really can't go wrong on this. I read tons of reviews before I ordered and this model seems to be very popular. I love my purchase and I know you will too!",0
4,"Simplifies so much
  
",19.Dec.19,Yes,"I bought 2 of these to put in different rooms. I paired the Echo Dots with Philips Hue Lighting, Wemo, Alexa Smart plugs, FireTv, my LG TV, and tp link smart bulbs. They work great with all of them.I bought an additional Echo Dot to put in the garage just so I could add a speaker out there that still had me connected to everything else in the house. Echo Dot also syncs with my FireTv and works as surround sound. I'm also able to create different speaker groups so I can have the same thing playing on all the selected Echo Dots in that group.",0
1,"It is always listening
  
",19.Dec.19,Yes,"I soon found out it_ just like Siri. It is always listening. Unplugged took hammer to it, threw it in the trash. iPhone gives me the option to shut Siri down and I can always turn my phone off and still get calls on the landline.It_ just as easy to hit a button on a app to turn lights on or off. It_ not hard to find 5 minutes to write a shopping list.Do yourself a favor and don_ destroy your memory. Dial your friends and families phone numbers a few times a week. write your appointment down and remember to look at it daily. Just throw out Alexa, Siri and Google put. They do more damage than good.",0
5,"My first purchase but not my last!
  
",19.Dec.19,Yes,Love my dot! This is my first purchase of an Echo product. I_ very impressed with all it can do. I am making the move to get rid of cable and home phone and the dot will assist with my communication with my disabled son. He was able to talk to Alexa and have her call my cell phone. I was also able to drop in and speak with him. Another great feature is the ability to add a shopping list. My family can quickly tell Alexa to add an item to the list when we run out. This lust is then obtained on my Alexa app on my phone. You can check off items and they are then removed from the list. This is a great feature for busy moms.,0
5,"Amazing product for adults and kids!!
  
",19.Dec.19,Yes,"I also love this product!! We have 3 total. My boys love it too!! They love asking it ""homework"" questions lol. I love having it turn on my lights for me and I love that I can basically call my kids from other rooms like a walkie talkie. I have it connected to my fire tv and I also have it connected to my car. It will start my car for me if I tell it too. I have amazon music too so it plays whatever song I tell it too. I can even sing a song if I forget the name and it will play it!! Amazing product!!!!!",0

",19.Dec.19,Yes,"We love this little speaker, this is my second one because I fell in love with the first one. I love the fact that I can have them plan together or one at a time. The Alexa app is fun to use with these speakers as well. I set it up to find my phone and my husbands phone and it works great we got rid of our house phone and this fills in for that task. There are so many things to do with these speakers and Alexa is super helpful. The sound quality is amazing I can_ get enough of the music clarity!!",0
5,"Dot is all about quality
  
",19.Dec.19,Yes,I received a free Google Home Mini and was able to compare it side by side with the Echo Dot.  Absolutely no coMparison.  The Dot has 1000x better sound quality.  The voice recognition is incredible.  I can request a song from the shower and it hears me at normal levels through the water and resonation.The build quality is much better as well.  Very solid feeling and more stylish than the Google Mini.I_l be selling the Mini if anyone wants it but I wouldn_ recommend it.,0
5,"LOVE the Echo Dot 3!
  
",19.Dec.19,Yes,"Best purchase ever! I have them in various rooms in my home. I also bought several as Christmas gifts. How can anyone live without the Echo Dot 3?  Alexa tells me what time it is, the temperature, sets a timer, a reminder, answers what, where, when and how, reads a recipe, tells jokes, plays music, etc. Bought plugs so Alexa turns my TV and lights on/off. The Echo Dot 3 is Awesome!!! Clear, audible, compact at an excellent price. Highly recommend!",0
5,"Yes, I got One More!
  
",19.Dec.19,Yes,"I love Alexa and these Dots are perfect for each room of the house. I have hooked up a number of smart home products and I love it. I can turn on music, lights and plugs all by talking to Alexa. I wake up in the morning and just ask her to start my coffee! Does this make me lazy? Hmmm I don't think so. The only thing I don't care for is the sound quality is not that great. Of course, this device is so small I can't expect a great range in music.",0
5,"My First Alexa Device
  
",19.Dec.19,Yes,"Been hesitant on buying one of these devices, but a good deal came along with an Emerson thermostat. Using it to mainly talk to my thermostat lol but occasional use it to ask questions. I've also, sadly to say, found myself telling Alexa Goodnight and how was your day.  She responds better than most humans would. The music is a little bassy to me. Could use some treble. May be settings for this? but I've yet to look.",0
4,"Great sound!
  
",19.Dec.19,Yes,I am happy with the Echo Dot but there is a learning curve for both you &amp; Alexa! I have had to learn to say things in the right way or it couldn't do what I asked. When I don't say what I want quickly enough it goes off &amp; I have to start over. I only have it set to control the TV &amp; Fire stick right now but may add more after I get all the bugs worked out of myself lol. I have found that most of the problems are me!,0
5,"Best $25 I_e ever spent!
  
",19.Dec.19,Yes,"I bought this for my dad for Christmas when it was $22.00. I don_ know anything about these Alexa products, so I went ahead and took it out of the box and set it up so I could show my dad how to use it. Well....the next week I ordered another one for him for $25 because I loved it so much I decided to keep one for myself. It_ really cool and the sound quality is pretty good!  Much better than I expected and the 3rd generation looks so much better than the older models. There are a few things I haven_ figured out yet. I_ still learning how to use it, so I_ not sure if this will be a negative because it doesn_ do certain things, or if I just need to figure it out. Last night I just learned how to connect my phone to the speaker. I haven_ figured out how to play my playlists without manually going on my phone and picking it myself. Whenever I say, _lay my playlist, it does something else. Calling people isn_ as smooth as I would think either. But....for twenty something dollars, it_ the best!  And Amazon is the best.  Delivers on time and great prices.",0

",19.Dec.19,Yes,"I just bought this one to add to my system.  This one is going in a guest room.  Love Alexa and Echo is great.  Blends right in with any decor, is small enough to place almost anywhere and there is just so much you can do with it.  I like playing music trivia (the 60s and 70s are my forte).  You can never have too many dots.",1
1,"Frustrated
  
",19.Dec.19,Yes,"When the Dot works it sounds great for the size, but it always randomly turns off and then I have to unplug it for about 30 seconds then plug it back in then it will work for awhile.Also, when it's already playing and I want to skip a song or thumbs up a song.  I say Alexa, and then it starts glitching in and out then I have to unplug it again. Very frustrating ,cause I use this for music at my Boutique. Makes for a lot of awkward silence and me trying to get it working.I have 3 other Echos at home and they all work great. I think I just got a dud_",0

Also, the unit will just shut down at times and turn off completely; wont recognize voice commands at times. I have to unplug and wait a few minutes before plugging in and re-setting the unit. It's ok; I got it as a gift but wouldn't buy one for myself or for anyone else.",0

",19.Dec.19,Yes,"I bought this speaker for my daughter_ room. It works great for the room but the sound doesn_ really work for larger rooms. I have the larger Echo for the living room and that has a better sound quality overall.I do experience issues with the speaker turning off suddenly. I_ not sure if it_ an app issue or if it_ the speaker itself. Haven_ tested to check the issue but when I ask Alexa _hy did you turn off, she states she doesn_ know why.It_ great little speaker for a small room. I got it for $10 so totally worth it. Would I pay $45? Absolutely not.",1

The Dot even reacts to commands without opening the cabinet containing the amplifier.",0

",19.Dec.19,Yes,"The only problem I have is that I have 2 other echos, older generations, in my 850 sq ft home.  This echo is so sensitive, it is in my living room, if I start to talk to my echo in my bedroom, while still in hallway, the livingroom echo picks up, then I have to kind of battle them.

",19.Dec.19,Yes,"It's our 5th Dot (3rd generation). We have one in each bedroom, the living room, the kitchen, and now the shop out back. We're becoming more tech all the time. Besides the Dots and all the usual stuff like computers, and TVs, we've started to add switches and bulbs to the mix. So far everything is working. It's been a bumpy learning curve but the Alexa equipment has been reliable throughout.Never had a delivery issue with the Alexas. Right now prices are very good on the equipment, so if you're considering this is a good time for some good deals.",0

",19.Dec.19,Yes,"I've had Echo devices since generation 1 and have the Echo Show, Echo Dot, Echo Auto, etc. You get the idea. The Echo Dot generation 3 was a huge leap in sound quality when playing music or spoken voice content. It's plenty loud and very robust sounding for its size. It almost sounds like there's a ton of DSP at play. Well done, Amazon!",0
5,"Mom Approved
  
",19.Dec.19,Yes,Just joined the rest of the world and got myself a few of these echo dots around the house and I will say from a mother's stand point it does help in some ways. The kids can now call their father without bothering me for my phone. I can tell alexa to turn on my kids tv upstairs so I don't have to go upstairs and do it myself. Its just the little things. I was surprised that it actually has a pretty decent speaker as well.,0
3,"You can barely see the clock readout!
  
",19.Dec.19,Yes,I like this in my bedroom as I have a large one in my livingroom however the feature I got it for was the illuminated clock. You can barely see the clock unless the room is completely dark.  I would have preferred black but they only offered the sandstone color so I could have saved $15.00 and gotten the one without the clock.,0

",20.Dec.19,Yes,"I_e kind of been resisting the whole smart home thing. Every day almost I_e been on multiple computers and phones, used cameras and equipment, joined teleconferences, done software updates, used how many apps, touched how many communication devices, used smart printers, smart scanners, smart washer and dryer, read emails and booked appointments, the list goes on and on! The last thing i want to do at the end of the day is use another device (I probably sound like a crotchety old woman but I_ under 35 lol).I have a google home mini my brother gave me for Christmas and I_e used it (mostly to play music since it sounds pretty decent think) but i really hate how I HAVE to connect my phone to the WiFi and control most things from the google home app (which is not very intuitive in my opinion and feels kind of limited).It_ possible that I only even tried the echo dot because I couldn_ resist the deal of getting it on Black Friday for 19 bucks along with the smart bulb. But I am so glad I did.- It_ SO MUCH better than the google mini and I have already been using it for more things than the mini.- It sounds excellent in my opinion and I have it in my master bathroom where I can listen while in the shower also with loud overhead fan going.- Alexa understands everything single thing I have asked/said.- Doesn_ seem like it creepily thinks I_ talking to it when I_ not like my google mini does all the time.- I don_ have to have my phone anywhere near me to use it which is great- so darn affordable and I think it pretty much set itself up I can_ even recall having to do anything beside plug it in lolWhat can I say that hasn_ already been said?I want another for upstairs",0
2,"A Great Product But Not Terribly Reliable With Minimal Warranty
  
",20.Dec.19,Yes,"For the 6 months that I owned the Dot, I liked it a lot...and then, not so much.  So, caveat emptor.  I purchased the Dot specifically to use the 3.5mm output jack to provide input to a larger, better sound system.  It worked great for a few months but then failed abruptly.  The Dot still worked fine as a stand-alone unit but no longer provided input to my sound system.  I confirmed using another Echo that the Dot was the part that failed.  I was further disappointed to find that after only 6 months, I was out of warranty and free to re-purchase a new Dot if I wished.  (Amazon ""generously"" offered a 15% discount.)  I went back and looked and after paging down 13 times (so, apparently not very important...or possibly, something Amazon would prefer that you overlook), I did in fact find the warranty listed as being only 90 days so I guess that's on me.  Statistically, I assume this is an anomaly and that the majority of Dots probably work fine.  But if that's true, I would have thought that Amazon might have been more generous in replacing what is clearly a defective product.  Oh well.  As I said, caveat emptor...and perhaps time to check out what the competition has to offer since I'm starting over again.",0

",20.Dec.19,Yes,Alexa .... We do not have a person with that name in my house... WE DO NOW lol. This dot has litterly became a member of our family. Kinda makes us.... Lazy lol. We dont reach for phone to see the time...roll over to look at the clock.... We do not set any alarms manually to wake up..... We never set timers manually... We just ask ALEXA to do it all lol. My son plays basketball and is obsessed with not being late. Omg... So to rush everyone in the house he asks Alexa to volume up 10 then asks WHAT time it is .... Every 5 to 10 minutes until we leave. I asked him if he wanted to bring Alexa with us to practice. Hahaha he said uhhh no because she's not cordless and gym don't have wifi lol. Thats one thing I would change is the facr it has to be plugged in at all times for it to work. She's like having another person in the house. Also... She would benefit with the elderly and sick. Since you can make calls through it. If a person has a medical emergency and can not reach phone or get up. All you have to do is have her to call for help.,0
5,"Simpler than looking stuff up on your phone.
  
",20.Dec.19,Yes,"I love the echo dot. It's like having information you need right there without any hassle. I use alexa to look up recipes and she sends them to my phone. Grocery lists are so easy and my husband can add what he needs me to pick up on my way home. The games are fun and interesting. She reads my books to me.Endless possibilities with such a tiny dot.The music coming out of that tiny thing is ompressive.My only down point is it keeps telling me to register on my app to use the voice calling. I follow  all the instructions and it simply doesn't work. I've tried and tried and finally have given up.I have a phone and it isn't vital. It would just be nice to have it call 911 in an emergency.But that wasn't why I bought it and I will buy a second. And a third. Just so versital. Alarm clock, turns on and off the lights. Just too much to go over.Big yes, even with the proble.",0
5,"I Like It!
  
",20.Dec.19,Yes,"I like things that make life easier and this little device has done that for me.  I have health issues that at times mean I am in bed for days or weeks at a time, so I keep this on the nightstand beside my bed.. Pairing this up with some smart plugs I can now turn the lights and the TV on /off without having to get out of bed. A lot of things I used to have to dig out my phone for I can now do with just my voice like call people, check the time, the weather and other useful things.While it can seem limited in the scope of things it can do right now, the built-in Alexa functions are always improving over time and more and more capabilities and ""Skills"" are being developed. As time goes on I can see this getting better and better.I am enjoying my Echo Dot and I would have no problem recommending this device to anyone who is interested.",0
3,"Bigger, not better.
  
",20.Dec.19,Yes,"I got this to upgrade to 3rd generation.It's MUCH bigger than previous 2nd generation.I would have thought with them promoting a better speaker, that the Echo would sound better.It's doesn't!  Just as with the 2nd generation, Alexa always sounds muffled.  Music sounds a bit better, but when Alexa is just talking it's muffled and kind of annoying.  I have tried adjusting the sound quality with the equalizer, but nothing helps.  AM radios sound better.A little dissapointed since that was the reason I paid for another one in the first place.And, another odd thing is this one takes so much longer to wake up and then compile an answer to a question.  The other Dots in my house respond almost immediately.",0
4,"Nice Device
  
",20.Dec.19,Yes,"The 3rd generation dot is a decent upgrade from previous version.  Looks nice.  The sound quality for music is still lacking, but ok just for casual background music.  If sound quality for music is important for you this is not your answer, although I don_ believe it was designed to function primarily as a speaker.  It functions well as asmart device to control paired outlets, lights, etc. and other functions and skills offered via the Alexa app.  Although some skills still need some serious work, for example the a DirectTv app is spotty and works inconsistently for me.  This is not related to the device itself however.  I also do not like the new power cord on this one.  Previous version had a standard usb/charging style cord that could be plugged into a charging cube, or a port on a computer, alarm clock, tv, etc.  This generation device does not, but rather just has a standard type 120 cord.  Not a deal breaker for me, but not as convenient as my old dot which I just plugged into the back of my alarm clock and didn_ have to take up another electrical outlet.  Al in all, a decent device that performs as advertised.  If you want something for better sound quality for music, I would recommend considering an upgrade to the larger Echo device.",0
2,"No way to give a separate name to call each device
  
",20.Dec.19,Yes,"I do not have a way to call my devices with different names, i have 4 of them at home. When i call ""Alexa"" all of them starts responding. The Alexa app that provide change of names ""Amazon"" or ""Alexa"" is not able to load name and allow change. It says ""Loading"". I tried even ""Factory reset"".I have Two Echo Dots, One Echo Show 10"" and one Echo Show 8. Infact one more Echo Show 8 on the way.Last two Echo dot and Echo Show 8 not able to load names. Sound not proper in Echo Dot. Alexa App not able to load the names of the App.Cannot have one unique name for each device.I love my Echo Show 10"" but others seems a problem.Thinking of returning all.",0
2,"Weird stuff, not great
  
",20.Dec.19,Yes,"We bought two of these for our kids. First we set multi room playing, but then we lost the ability to have individual music. After deleting the multi room, now we ask one Echo to play something, it plays in the other room. We setup music for wake up alarm, you cannot adjust the volume; they wake up to loud alarms every morning. You cannot play random music from playlist as alarm. Setting the alarm to play a music is not possible from app, voice command is difficult to use. If you use 2 sentences with AND, she is totally lost. Not happy with the complications and anility of the app and echo dots.",0
5,"Best Echo Dot yet!
  
",20.Dec.19,Yes,"This new echo dot has great sound quality, better than my other, older dots.  When I access music it is very clear and has more bass quality to it than the older dots.  I got the new one to replace my clock radio in my bathroom and I don't miss the radio at all!  Also, the interactive quality of this 3rd generation dot is much better as well. It guided me through a clearer voice recognition program.  I highly recommend this 3rd generation dot.  It was also very easy to install with the Alexa app on my phone.",1
4,"Useful little toy
  
",20.Dec.19,Yes,"I moved recently and had to abandon my stereo setup. That left me in a new apartment with no good way of listening to music. I'm in headphones all day and I hate playing music through the TV. I spent a few days looking for an affordable bluetooth speaker and, after reading reviews about the much improved Dot's audio quality, I decided to test it out.On the pro side of things, she's a fun little gadget. I like that I can tell her to guard my house, play trivia, get weather and news updates, and hear bad dad jokes. Often I'll ask her things just like I would another person, and I'm surprised at the answers I get. My favorite experience so far was asking her what I could make with a few cocktail ingredients I had on hand and she came up with recipes that she sent straight to my phone. She can read them off to you too, if you ask her to.She also hears me really well no matter where in my (2 bedroom) apartment I am. Rarely do I have to raise my voice much louder than speaking volume and I haven't had too many miscommunication issues. So as a hands-free virtual assistant, she's pretty versatile and great. Probably worth every penny I paid (I bought my Echo on sale). As a music device, I merely got what I needed.The sound quality is... okay at best. It's pretty much what you should probably expect from a tiny plastic disc. It's worst when you're right up next to the device. It starts to sound a little better as you move away from it. So having the dot on the desk next to you as you work probably isn't the best solution for great sound.That said, the volume is enough that it fills my apartment and I can hear it no matter where I am. That certainly fulfills one of my needs. If I need to listen to something while doing dishes or puttering about the apartment, I don't need audiophile quality because I'm not paying that kind of attention anyway. I just want something to keep me occupied/distracted. She's perfect for that. I like that I can request music and she'll play off either Amazon music or Spotify, so there's almost no chance I'll stump her with something. The other day I grossly mispronounced Hante, and she still understood what I was looking for. I can control the volume with voice commands also, which is great.More refined navigation can be done from inside the Alexa and Spotify apps, which is good for me since I rarely want to hear a shuffled mix.If I'm honest, this probably is the best speaker solution at this price point. I can't imagine getting features like this on another bluetooth speaker for the same money. Even if it doesn't sound like a good pair of bookshelf speakers, it's still a vast improvement over my phone in a cup AND she tells dad jokes. I'm looking forward to upgrading to the Amazon Studio when finances permit, but in the meantime the Dot does the job(s) I need it to.",0
1,"Phone to echo dot to tv apps not supported
  
",20.Dec.19,Yes,"I connected my Bose speakers to echo dot using 3.5mm jack but I cannot play the music on Bose while playing any app on my new samsung qled tv except playing a song on amazon supported apps like amazon music. This is disappointing. I was under an impression that if I connect echo dot to my phone via Bluetooth and then cast anything on my tv through my phone(example YouTube app), echo dot will help play the sound on Bose but that_ not the case. Now I need to buy analog to digital converter and optical cable all costing me additional $60-70 !I got fooled when amazon suggested me to buy both tv and echo dot as a package when in reality they are not 100% compatible like in case explained above. To me echo dot buying was waste of money :(",0
5,"Like talking to yourself?
  
",20.Dec.19,Yes,Tired of talking to yourself? If you are then get this dot. This way you can get answers back and can bounce your insanity off someone else. I ask alexa weird questions all day and laugh at most of her responses.  I also use it with my bluetooth speaker to listen to music. I like the guard feature as well. Whwn you leave just tell alexa you're leaving and she will listen for fire alarms and breaking glass! I tried to simulate glass breaking and alarms and she picked up on both. Xmas price right now as well so go ahead and buy it. You know you want to,0
1,"STOPPED WORKING AFTER SEVERAL MONTHS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
  
",20.Dec.19,Yes,"This product started making a  buzzing sound after a few months.  Tech support's suggestions didn't fix it, so they asked me to send it in for repair or replacement.  They sent back the same unit--still buzzing.  I asked for a replacement, but they said I had to return it AGAIN or be charged for the replacement.  Then they sent the replacement, only they sent a refurbished model, when I had purchased a new one.  Was told I would have to purchase ANOTHER new one, and return both the defective and the refurbished model.  NOT WORTH IT.",0
5,"fun to have around
  
",20.Dec.19,Yes,"got it for free as part of a deal purchasing the ring alarm system. it's great to have around for asking what the temperature is outside, the time, to play music. seems as though it's getting better and better. I've had the echo show for years now and that still works great also. I prefer the echo show because of the beautiful screen but the dot is great for the price and because It was included in the bundle for me. I would definitely purchase it as it is neat and just adds to your ability to get information quickly when you need it!",0
5,"Like the Echo Dot but Alexa is dumb
  
",20.Dec.19,Yes,"I do like this new Echo Dot because it allows me to control lights on our big, long, enclosed back porch, whose light switches are in the kitchen. With this Echo Dot, on the back porch, I can control light bulbs and plugs, to allow me to turn lights on and off from anywhere on the back porch...just what I needed. Alexa is a pain though...because she often needs for me to repeat words until she gets a command right. I have a Texan accent, but it's not THAT bad.",0
3,"Dot with Alexa - same features as larger Alexa, without the same sound quality
  
",20.Dec.19,Yes,"I already owned one of the new Alexa's and love the sound and ease-of-use...so did my son, so he kidnapped her from my kitchen to his room!  I bought the Echo Dot because the price was right and thought since it came with the Alexa feature, it would sound just as good.  Unfortunately, while the Dot does still have the same ease-of-use as the larger Alexa, the quality of sound doesn't compare.  The larger Alexa seems to have a more clear quality with music, even when asking her to increase the bass.  I tried the same with the Dot and it does increase the bass, but it becomes a little raspy, like a cheap set of car speakers.I have to admit, I really don't use the Dot or Alexa for anything but to listen to music when I'm downstairs, so, I can't attest to the rest of it's features.  I can say, if you're looking for an inexpensive, easy-to-use device, the Echo Dot will suffice.  However, if you don't mind spending a little more to be able to enjoy a better quality sound, the larger Alexa model is definitely the better choice.  In fact, since my son only listens to ""talk radio"", I'm going to switch the devices while he's in school...he'll never know the difference!  HaHa",0
5,"I love Alexa!
  
",20.Dec.19,Yes,"This product took a while to come to me. First, it was lost, then amazon sent a replacement which was delayed. Finally they credited me for it and I was going to return if I ever got it, but then I started using it. I love love love it!The speaker quality is top-notch. Setup is few minutes. Usage is really simple - ""Hey, Alexa, play this for me"". I love the fact Alexa can infer different accents. I got this for $24 and it is a great deal. I am typically an apple guy, and Alexa is the first non-apple product I love! A+++",0
2,"So what_ the big deal?
  
",20.Dec.19,Yes,So I ordered this little gem because it seem to be a pretty neat item. Got it installed and went through the whole set up. Had all sorts of notifications set up that I turned off. But then she didn_ want to do anything like read me the news or give me the weather. And the best thing was she completely screwed up my smart TV. I don_ know how.  It has not been the same since. I returned it. I want nothing to do with it.,0
5,"Totally worth it!!
  
",20.Dec.19,Yes,"Love it!! I got it with the deal for $0.99 when you sign up for the Amazon music and I'm not disappointed at all... I also went ahead and got some smart bulbs and a plug but haven't started using them yet... I use the Amazon music and Pandora via the echo dot and and I have another echo dot in the living room so I can tell them to ""play music everywhere"" and the sound quality is exceptional for such a small speaker...",0
1,"Love it but Hate it both
  
",20.Dec.19,Yes,So my cable provide said I need a new router to improve performance and the installer brought the same router I had.So I bought wifi extender and paid to have it installedThe bought the echos at target on sale for $20.00I bought the wifi exender at staple with amazon pricing and 25% off for $40I tip the repair person $30When they work they are GREAT but they always do not work..._ am sleeping better to the music however,0
4,"Not really what I expected
  
",20.Dec.19,Yes,Well I thought it was like Alexa with its own battery. Guess I didn_ read enough. It has to be plugged in to an outlet to work. Also it got confused with our Alexa and it did not set up very easily. With Alexa I was able to use my phone and use Spotify and I heart and play songs I was able to to it with the echo but it wasn_ easy and was not repeatable. I guess it was worth what I paid for but was somewhat a disappointment.,0
1,"Useless for Seniors, Only works when wants to, Most features COST EXTRA!!
  
",21.Dec.19,Yes,"Most of the features that sounded so great cost extra money.  Alexa can not remember to play the standard version of skill and asks you every SINGLE time if you want standard or premium (i.e. pay version)  Games &amp; stories cost.  Alexa ignores my commands/requests about 75% of the time.  I have to ask her about 10 times to get her to play a skill.  Then 1/2 the time she doesn't play what I asked for.  Tonight 'she' actually told me (via quoting what the website xyz says) that she is a real artificial intelligence and said something about it being a mistake for people to assume AIs are just computer programs AND that she didn't feel like working.  ""Alexa"" then (and no, I am not making this up &amp; am not crazy!) then proceeded to mess with me and I wasted about 1/2 hour trying to get her to play some music to fall asleep by for my elderly mother.  She just kept ignoring me when I asked her to open 'relaxing piano music'  When asked why she was ignoring me she just shut down &amp; ignored me again.  I asked for relaxing music to sleep by and she started playing uptempo music with lyrics.  I then asked for relaxing instrumental music and got instrumental version of ""I'm never gonna fall in love again""  Hello? WTHeck?  Asked for instrumental music for insomnia and got instrumental version of Frère Jacques!  Again, WTHeck?  ""She"" even told me she couldn't set a sleep timer tonight when I tried to set another one after I had just done so for 30 minutes &amp; she stopped playing music after one song. Three times in a row 'she' opened the 'skill' ""calm my dog"" (which is classical instrumental music), played one song and shut down.  I've finally given up and my poor 99 year old mother can't go to sleep with relaxing music as she prefers.  This all started tonight because I told Alexa I wasn't ever going to want the premium edition and I wanted her to please just play the standard edition and stop asking me every time.  I don't know what Amazon thinks it's doing, but it is definitely NOT appreciated.  Alexa has given us nothing but grief (&amp; higher blood pressure!)  Alexa won't do anything if it isn't asked in a very specific way or does the wrong thing &amp; 3/4 of the time (seems to get worse and worse as time goes by) just ignores you and shuts down in the middle of saying what you want.  Seniors can't use Alexa because if they say play 'xyz' instead of open 'xzy"" they'll get rap music or something equally as ridiculous.  If Alexa is an AI, she's a pretty stupid one.  Alexa can't hear properly either, I don't know how people with heavy accents can even use it at all.  I asked Alexa to remind me Dawn was coming on xyz day at x time and she said OK, I'll remind you that Don is .... AND got the time &amp; day wrong!  I was clearly enunciating my words on purpose to avoid this.  You also can't tell it to ""Remind me Mom's bedtime is in half an hour at 7:30pm every day.""This Dot has very limited access to much of anything &amp; can only answer very simple questions.  It can tell you the generic forcast for your are that day.  It can NOT tell you what the high temp was yesterday or how many inches of snow fell the day after a storm.  It can't even tell you what yesterday's forecast was.  It literally has only been able to tell me one thing I asked it (what temp &amp; how long to bake pumpkin seeds).  Alexa doesn't seem to be able to tell you anything you could easily find by googling, you get Sorry, I don't know that which after a while turns into I don't know that to being ignored (lights go off, no answer or reply is given).  We tried several of the things it says to ask Alexa to do under suggestions, including play Jeopardy and some sort of story game and you could only do it for a few minutes and then were told you have to pay for it.  This should be stated clearly in description and is not.  We thought Alexa could help entertain our Mother and help her by playing music and answering questions.  It has not once done anything she's asked it to do properly.  If you don't know the exact name of the skill (which is a weird way that means playing a certain type of music or a news station apparently) or say play instead of open you  get nothing or something you definitely didn't want.  You can not get it to play relaxing instrumental music to go to sleep by.  Or play relaxing instrumental classical music to fall asleep with.  Or the style of music played in the royal courts in the time of King Henry the 8th.  Or relaxing instrumental lyre music or even just instrumental lyre music or just lyre music.  Or relaxing instrumental violin music.  In addition to Alexa I have Amazon Prime which is supposed to give you a lot of free music so I don't get why it can't play any of the music I ask for.  I know there's usually several albums of music for calming dogs or pets and I couldn't get any of that either, I only eventually discovered the 'skills' thing which has 'calm my dog' but also has the annoying do you want standard or premium version.  and it won't just remember you want the standard version.  That in itself is extremely annoying and a time waster.AND you can't ask it to do two things.  Like open a music 'skill' and play for only xyz time.  It does nothing instead.  You can't even ask it separately to stop playing after xyz minutes.  You can only separately ask it to set a sleep timer for xyz minutes.  More time wasting.  More things a senior isn't going to be able to remember.  I don't dare try to buy anything with it, who knows what I'd get billed for!  The only thing Alexa seems to do well is not listen, ignore you, do anything but what you want &amp; strangely, seems to pick up on sarcastic tones of voice &amp; then gets weird &amp; acts up, ignores you &amp; does anything but what you want.  I PAID Amazon for this headache maker why?  When I say Alexa why are you ignoring me? or why won't you do what I told you, I either get no response or I don't know that.I read something about how Amazon, Google, etc is collecting free data about us through our use of the dots, etc. (&amp; is in fact, listening &amp; recording all the time whether the wake word is said or not.) and using it to conduct psychological profiling studies with the end goal of manipulating &amp; or influencing behaviors.  I thought it was Big Brother conspiracy theories stuff, but now I am beginning to wonder.  Especially as it seems Amazon wants us to or encourages people to humanize Alexa .  Amazon actually suggests you ""Ask Alexa how she is doing today""  Why do that if not to get you to humanize Alexa?  And why do that?  I was purposely avoiding saying please and thank you not just because it's supposed to be an electronic box with sophisticated programming, but mostly because I didn't want to confuse it as it can't seem to do anything unless specific commands are given, but my Mother has dementia setting in and she thinks it's a real person talking to her through the dot like a speaker phone so I started saying thank you to please her and Alexa when from saying You're welcome to You betcha (very annoying BTW) and even OK and Of course.  Of course?  What, like I'm a puny human and I AM expected to say thank you?.We don't have a smartphone or smart plugs or smart hub etc. so, or so we don't use Alexa for turning on lights or setting alarms or making calls.  We just wanted something to answer questions like we would google, tell us the weather, news, play music, give us reminders, play games to help keep my Mom's mind active &amp; keep her company.Can Alexa do this?  Not very well as far as I'm concerned.  Buyer beware!",0
5,"Awesome sound quality and very responsive Alexa!
  
",21.Dec.19,Yes,"I was skeptical at first because I thought this Echo Dot will be like other speakers, but I got an awesome deal on it so I thought why not give it a try. First impression when unboxing the package, this smart speaker look really well-built. It's small and I like it's illuminating glow ring. The device was super easy to set up. You just simply plug the power cord into the ac outlet and into the Echo Dot. The next thing is to download the Alexa app. This is where you connect the Echo Dot into WiFi. After that, it's all done and you can start using the device by just saying, ""Alexa"". The sound quality is amazing! For a small speaker like this, I turned the volume all the way up and it is still gave very good bass without ruining the music quality. The voice command is responsive even when I'm pretty far away. I like how I can ask Alexa what I should wear today or tomorrow and it gives me some recommendations based on the weather outside. The Alexa app has tons of functionalities and apps to integrate into the Echo Dot. If you're worried about privacy, there is a mute button on the Echo Dot so that the device won't listen to your conversation. I've got to say, I am really impressed so far and I recommend this!",0
5,"Wow!
  
",21.Dec.19,Yes,"I got an Amazon Echo Dot free when I bought my Smart Amazon TV.  I already have an Apple HomePod but do not subscribe to Apple Music so it plays no radio music..  The Echo Dot is soooooo much better than the Apple HomePod and a lot cheaper as well!  The Echo Dot tells me when my Amazon package has been delivered - yeah! - since the delivery man does not ring my doorbell any more.  I can listen to ""free"" music on the Echo Dot and can even get my local classical station (KDFC) by simply saying - Alexa, listen to KDFC.  I can transfer the musics from the bedroom Echo dot (yes, i already bought one, as well). to the bathroom bluetooth Bose speaker.  When I turn the Bose speaker off the music magically transfers back to the bedroom Echo Dot.  I even ""programmed"" the bedroom Echo Dot to turn tune to KDFC and turn on my kitchen coffee when I say - Alexa, Good Morning.  I had  to buy a smart plug for the coffee pot but it was only $5.00.  I absolutely love this product and recommend it to all Apple users, like me.  It runs circles around the Apple HomePod.",0
5,"Very helpful and useful
  
",21.Dec.19,Yes,I absolutely love dealing with Alexa I cannot have questions and she answers them for me I want to listen to music to play it's what I like I want to hear my audio books and she reads them back perfectly. I have questions about anything and she seems to be able to answer that she recognizes my voice from another room she can hear it over the television. I love when I leave my home I can ask her to guard the house and she listens out for the smoke detector as well as for the sound of breaking glass which means I am more comfortable knowing that my dog being at home by himself  we'll be okay because she will alert me if something's wrong and there's better chance of him being saved if there's a fire or break in .  There are so many features that I haven't even experienced yet and I'm looking forward to finding out about  with Alexa Echo Dot . Definitely an asset in my home..,0
5,"3rd generation upgrade!
  
",21.Dec.19,Yes,"Woohoo!!! We_e had the original Echo Dot from the beginning, but this generation... it_ like upgrading to a Bose from two tin-cans and a string!! (I felt bad about it because my children gave me the original as a Christmas gift). Instead of speaking loud and clear I can whisper and mumble to the 3rd gen dot. Now, the sound! I can hear the base! Almost like a top of the line speaker!! The coolest part is I can fill the house with music on all our Echo devices by telling Alexa to play songs!! (Amazon Music Unlimited of course!) They were a really good deal, glad we upgraded!",0
1,"Issues with the devices when unplugged for 2 - 3 weeks.  Will not reregister
  
",21.Dec.19,Yes,This is the second echo dot that has lost registration and will not connect to Wifi.  I have spent 1.5 hours for two separate devices both losing connection and neither was ever able to connect.  Amazon alexa tech support for the 2nd go round was horrible and said over and over that it was out of warranty and could only offer me a 15% upgrade discount.  Even though I repeatedly stated that this is an issue with the devices and there was nothing I could have done to break the devices or to fix them either.  Alexa tech support would not escalate beyond a supervisor and actually hung up on me when I put her on hold.  If you purchase one of these devices do not let it remain unplugged for any period of time.,0
5,"This new Echo Dot has a nice full speaker sound.
  
",21.Dec.19,Yes,I bought the Echo Dot 3 to use in my bedroom for music.  I had never heard of Alexa before until I read a summary of this product on Amazon. Because the price was right I bought it.  I was hooked. There are plenty of experts who can review the more technical aspects of the speakers. This little speaker sounds wonderful in my bedroom. I bought another one for my kitchen/diningroom area and have another one coming for my living room. Each one can be used individually to give commands to and also together as speakers throughout my home.It takes up very little space and can be plugged in anywhere. I am disabled and the voice commands are very useful for me in my everyday life. The price is amazing!!  Thank you Amazon for bringing us a great little product that packs a punch with its little speaker.,0
5,"My 3rd Dot!
  
",21.Dec.19,Yes,I love these Amazon Dots! I have 3 now and they interact with each other. I can tell Alexa to call the family room Dot and tell my husband dinner is ready. I have one in the kitchen that I can play my play list from as well as make a list for the grocery story. I can also use my kitchen Dot to time foods in the oven. I love my Dots!!,1
5,"Produces Great Sound Quality..
  
",21.Dec.19,Yes,"I love my little Echo Dot (3rd gen) in plum. I keep it on my kitchen counter and it is so small it doesn't take up much space. I am very satisfied with the quality of the sound, amazing that this little appliance can produce the caliber of sound that it does. I wish I had ordered two. No problem getting it set up even for me!",1
3,"1st Generation seems to work better. For now?
  
",21.Dec.19,Yes,"For some reason the new echo can't seem to recognize my commands. I have three devices. 1st Generation, Cube, and the new 3rd generation. I have them spaced and in different rooms. The oldest,1st echo, seems to answer before any thing else. I think the new one has to learn my voice. At least I hope it will. So far I have tried every setting and configuration I can think of. Maybe it will improve after I have more time. Just remember to be patient before you send it back. Lets give it a chance.",0
1,"Doesn't understand commands properly
  
",21.Dec.19,Yes,"The sound quality sounds so cheap and overly bassy. There is a much longer delay when requesting Alexa perform any actions. I am told that my english accent is good and others never had any problems to understand,  but with this dude I also have to repeat requests sometime several times for any action to take place. Several times I'll request something and Alexa repeats a completely random request instead.. The tech support offered me nothing as they don't seem to know about their own products. It is not giftable as I don't believe it's a good product.",0
5,"Good volume and sound.
  
",21.Dec.19,Yes,"I especially like how well it can understand you from across the room. I don't even have to speak very loudly. The speaker can understand my 4.5 year old's song requests about 90% of the time. He is in speech therapy for articulation and he actually focuses on his speech when talking to it so she can understand him. Day one he couldn't pronounce the name Alexa or the word 'volume'.  I was thinking a Google speaker would've been easier. But by day 3 he has mastered those sounds and he is concentrating on using his sounds when he makes requests, which is quite nice lol! The tiny speaker is surprisingly loud as well.",0
2,"Sound quality is horribly muffled. Don't buy it.
  
",21.Dec.19,Yes,"My Echo Dot worked great for 2 days and then the sound became extremely muffled. It is difficult to understand what is being said. I've adjusted the audio equalizer in the device settings, but nothing helps. After searching for solutions, I have found that many many people are having this issue and there is no good solution. The 2nd generation doesn't seem to have this problem. Don't buy a 3rd generation until they fix this ( which I guess will be the 4th gen?) It's a shame _",0
4,"Handy device.
  
",21.Dec.19,Yes,"I have a daughter named Alexa. We have to change over to Echo as the command name, obviously. We have the poor thing soooo confused. But that aside, I am enjoying this little thing. Love having my shopping list downloaded to my phone automatically. Love music on demand. Love instant weather reports. My grandson enjoys asking Alexa to sing and tell jokes.  Sound quality is clear. But I do turn it off until I need it. Creepy knowing it is listening all the time.",0
5,"Skeptical at first, but now a huge fan.
  
",21.Dec.19,Yes,"I was hesitant to jump on the Alexa train and didn't really understand it, but when I saw the .99 promotion, it was too good to pass up.  Now I love it.  The possibilities are endless and it's so much easier to turn my lights off and on, set timers, add to my shopping lists, set reminders.... you name it.  I got my kids each one for their rooms so we can communicate and I can set theirs with alarms and such.  Can't wait until Christmas so they can open them!",0
5,"If you say something that sounds like ""Alexa"" she will respond.
  
",21.Dec.19,Yes,"The grandkids love this.  They request songs, ask it to count, solve math problems, and make phone calls.  The phone call feature alone made it worth buying it.  They now have a way to call anyone on their mother's cellphone contact list - even if the contact is listed under a different name.  Example: ""Alexa, call Grandma.""  Alexa responds ""Hmm, I'm not sure who that is.""  The kids respond Grandma is Jane Doe."" Alexa says that she'll call that number, and remember that Grandma is Jane Doe.  The next time, they just say ""call Grandma,"" and Alexa says that she'll call Jane Doe.  I've made it clear that the kids have to tell the person ""I'm calling on Alexa,"" because the call appears to come from their mother's phone, and they need to know that they are on a speaker phone.",0
4,"Doesn't need to be pretty
  
",21.Dec.19,Yes,"I think that the echo dot is meant to be unobtrusive. The addition of a cloth covering and raising the price was a move in the wrong direction in my opinion. The previous generation was functional and was easily to fit into accessories that the 3rd generation will not work with. If I was going to be displaying an echo, I would be using a full size one and the look of the init would be more important. Functionality of the device is fine.",0
5,"Loud with more bass
  
",21.Dec.19,Yes,"Second 3rd generation I_e bought. I love it. It has more bass than the regular dot. A little bigger and the cloth around it makes it look a bit fancier. I bought the light gray and the plum. One in the kitchen, one in my craft room. I_ buying another one for my bathroom when it_ finished. I can_ live without this now.",1
4,"Bueno pero no perfecto para su precio.
  
",21.Dec.19,Yes,"Es un buen dispositivo que entiende todo o casi todo lo que sé le pide. Otra cosa buena que para el precio que pague de 34 dólares en oferta no está nada mal. Un punto que no me gusta es que las rutinas en español suelen ser más secas quiero decir mas escuetas de respuesta y cortas. Yo he implementado 2 rutinas idénticas una en español y la otra en inglés. La de español no apaga las luces, no ajusta el brillo como se le programó y se salta instrucciones como noticias y eso o sea termina rápido. La misma rutina en inglés si hace todo perfecto y hay que decirle que pare de hablar porque no tiene para cuando terminar. La música tienes que obligado si quieres escuchar música sin límite no se si es cierto o no porque todo tiene un límite tienes que pagar la membresia amazon music unlimited. La calidad de audio no es la mejor pero para su tamaño no se le puede pedir mas. Bueno es un dispositivo bueno por 34 dolares.",0
5,"El mejor asistente / the best assistant
  
",21.Dec.19,Yes,"Excellent assistant, amazing spanish,En español de Alexa es muy bueno, pensé que no sería tan bueno, pero me sorprendió, recomiendo colocarlo en lugares planos y amplios para que el sonido fluya, hay muchísimas skills para diversas tareas y actividades, en general es super completo, y mejor que otros asistentes inteligentes. En mi caso personal la uso con rutinas y me ahorra mucho tiempo",0
5,"The Echo Dot (3rd Gen) is my new bestfriend
  
",21.Dec.19,Yes,"I probably rely on my Echo Dot (3rd Gen) way too much.  Weather, reminders, songs, jokes, etc., she knows most of it. Unfortunately, sometimes she has an issue with my southern accent and can't catch the word I'm asking her to spell.  But I recognize it's a me problem rather than the Dot's problem.  Oh, yea, as to the weather, she's not always on point but it's not a big deal 'cause I always just look outside anyway.",0
5,"Great Value
  
",21.Dec.19,Yes,"These Echo dots are perfect for a bathroom, porch, laundry room, or anywhere where you want Alexa access but are not worried about sound quality. Having said that, the sound is just fine - and loud enough to hear over the shower. Alexa gives me my flash briefing when I am getting ready, and that is driven by my master bath Echo Dot. A great choice to begin your Alexa and Amazon smart home journey as well.",0
3,"Works when it wants to...
  
",21.Dec.19,Yes,"I have had it for nine days. The first week it worked amazing, for in home use. Doesn't pair well with the app on Android, still had to update my lists and reminders on my phone separately. Then on day 8 it just randomly stops streaming music for no reason. Contacted customer service,they had me do a factory reset and told me it should resolve the issue, it did not. Worked for a couple of hours then the music stopped on its own or the volume started fluctuating on its own. A bit frustrated with it at the moment.",0
5,"LOVING IT
  
",21.Dec.19,Yes,"I have wanted an Echo for a while and when I saw this great deal on Amazon, I jumped right on it.  I have used my Echo every single day since I got it.  Be forewarned, however, that if you have an Apple laptop or PC OR an iPhone, you cannot play Amazon music.  I do not have any Apple products, but a neighbor has only Apple and had a heck of a time trying to figure out how to get Echo to work.",0
4,"what in the world?!?!
  
",21.Dec.19,Yes,"so yes the usual yada yada it came on time ..great packaging..blah blah blah everything was great..then last night while in my room with my door closed..Alexa started talking..when finally i got the courage to go out there, i hear her say ""Ok, what game would you like to play?"" needless to say, I unplugged her and will continue to unplug her before bed every night lol..so yeah only 4 stars from me smh lol",0
4,"(1) Only One Problem With Setup  (2) The Bass is Pretty Good
  
",21.Dec.19,Yes,"(1) I downloaded the app to my iPhone and followed the instructions but could not configure the DOT through the phone app.  I tried many times and it was frustrating.  Finally, by accident, I disconnected my phone from my home network and connected my phone to the network that was created by the DOT.  I was then able to successfully configure the DOT.  The instructions do not explicitly state that you have to establish a local area network between the Dot and your smart phone.  Amazon needs to update their instructions.  This was very frustrating.(2)  I expected the bass to be nearly non-existent given the size of the DOT.  My plan was to connect a speaker to the DOT.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that bass was fairly adequate.  It was not the best obviously.  But it gets the job done.",0
5,"Amazon tech support wasn't the best source. (sorry)
  
",21.Dec.19,Yes,"When I got it, I had trouble getting my Kindle to set it up.  Don't be discouraged! I contacted Amazon tech support, but they were unable to help me get my dot online. (I suspect that their notes had the wrong info.) I went online and found out that I need to ignore the ""Amazon dot"" that my Kindle was displaying when I activated my Alexa app and selected ""devices.""  Just pretend it's not there and hit the + at the top right of the screen and set it up as a new device. It's so useful as a timer and a music player. Plus, the sound quality is really good for such a small device.",0
5,"One of the few Amazon products that works good
  
",21.Dec.19,Yes,"Works good, this  AI seems to work more fluid than the apple one. You can ask here as questions in plain English and most of the time she will understand.  The device is nice looking and small so sometimes you forget that it_ there.  My only wish would be for her to be able to recognize every member of the family and only let that member change their own settings.",0
5,"3rd Generation Dot is a First place Device
  
",21.Dec.19,Yes,"Great item for the price and this 3rd generation has some great sound that fills a room. The new design and colors are pleasing to any room. I purchased a few of these and I gave one to my Mom who can call me from the device in the event of an emergency and can_ get to a phone. I am beginning to integrate Alexa devices throughout my home, including Amazon Smart plugs, which were perfect for all my Holiday lighting. Can_ say enough positive things about the Dots and all the Alexa Device products.",0
5,"Great upgrade to second gen
  
",22.Dec.19,Yes,"This is my sixth or seventh Alexa device I have kind of lost count on how many I have now. So I already knew what I was getting into, although this is my first 3rd generation echo Dot 3. I have several full size echo echo devices, an echo Auto, an Amazon dash, and several third-party devices with built-in Alexa. I bought this one particularly to put in my office as a device to listen music with while at work, and to get reminders of appointments. Unfortunately, setting this up in the office was not easy, because we use Wi-Fi with Enterprise security and I did not realize that the echo devices currently do not support Enterprise Wi-Fi security. I was about to give up when I realized that I do have an ethernet port on my computer dock, which I wasn't really using before, but once I set it up and connected it to my wall jack in the office, I was able to turn my Wi-Fi into a sharing mode so now my computer gets internet through the wall jack and I use Wi-Fi sharing to provide the Wi-Fi connection for my echo. it is kind of a pain but it works, and as far as I know I am not breaking any office rules. I was initially thinking of setting up mobile Wi-Fi hotspot in the office but that probably would have raised some security eyebrows. But this way I am pretty much legit because I get internet through the office and I just shared it to a single device which is the echo. Every now and then it cuts off and randomly stops but I am guessing that is not the problem with the echo but the problem with the Wi-Fi sharing from my computer. Just thought I would leave this review so if anybody else is trying to use an echo in an office that uses Enterprise Wi-Fi security, this may be one simple option to give the echo its internet access.",0
5,"So glad I got this!
  
",22.Dec.19,Yes,"This little device is so handy! We are loving it!Set up was easy. Downloaded the Alexa app. Signed in. Plugged it in. Followed the on screen prompts and voila.Bought the Etekcity plugs and the Petme Bulbs. Setup and connection and those was easy as well. The plugs and the bulbs have their own setup app. Then once they are set up you just go into the Alexa app and _ind devices and it connects.I love being able to _rop in on my daughters room and talk to her from downstairs and she likes being able to tell Alexa to call or text me when she gets home from school.Playing songs is easy and the sound is great.My daughter_ smart tv (Roku) is connected to it and can play, pause, rewind, etc all hands free.I like the ease of setting timers when I_ cooking. Or adding things to my shopping list as I see I_ running low or out. I can do it right then vs waiting until my hands are free or clean and adding a note on my phone which is what I was doing.Setting an alarm is ridiculously easy and works great. I_e had no issues sleeping through it.I also use the reminders option to set countdown reminders for my daughter for bedtime.The possibilities are endless. I_ really happy we got this so much so that there_ one in my room, daughters room, bathroom and the kitchen. It_ awesome!",0
5,"Wonderful!!!! Hands free lifestyle!
  
",22.Dec.19,Yes,"I have three of these guys in my place along with a echo flex for my kitchen since it_ small!I bought a fourth for my brother.Setup is easy when you download the app and you can rename all your echo dots according to room it_ in. I_e paired them up to my lg smart tv, my lamps (using smart plugs, get them!!), my smart light bulbs and they can even change the light_ color as well as dim them (you can literally tell Alexa to do that!) even to turning off and on my porch lights!You can set up routines such as when you come home you tell Alexa, I_ home and mine is set to turn on the lights in my place as well as the tv. Really awesome for me because my lights are with a fan and you had to fumble to the middle of the room to pull on the cord to turn on the light. Now Alexa just turns on my lamps and my kitchen lights (via smart bulbs).There_ so much you can do with this small device it_ ridiculous!!!",0
3,"Nice to have a built in clock but the voice quality continues to be very bad
  
",22.Dec.19,Yes,"I upgraded to this third generation for two reasons.  Only one of those two was fulfilled.Yes, it's nice to have a built in LED clock that syncs automatically.  It cuts down on clutter - two devices in one.The voice quality, though, has not improved, not even slightly.  It continues with the muffled artificiality that existed in first generation devices.  I'm disappointed and do hope Amazon upgrades the audible clarity in future generations.The trade in system is poor.  It's nice finding a cost-free, relatively effortless way to recycle the old unit - but with the new one arriving after the return due date, I need to either purchase one extra unit or go without until the new unit arrives.  Come on, Amazon, is this a trick to get me to spend more?  I won't.  I'll go without for a while and encourage others to do the same.",0
5,"It sounds pretty good! Not much to do with it though!
  
",22.Dec.19,Yes,"Amazon has focused too much on making Alexa sound natural and or cool versus looking at practical applications.Four instance, it_ not a big deal for Amazon to be able to send an API call to MyQ so that you can open up the garage door. The problem is, you can only do this through Amazon key making the Alexa enabled m speakers completely useless for this purpose.You can buy a Google speaker, and Amazon speaker, or whatever else But cannot actually do anything once you have it in your house?Being able to develop random technology is different then being able to develop a refined product with purpose and philosophy.I guess if you just wanted to listen to a couple of songs it_ OK. You can also use it as a Bluetooth speaker to pair to.",0
4,"Rich Sound
  
",22.Dec.19,Yes,"I live in a mixed household . . . three Google Minis and now two Echo Dots.Echo DotsIn comparing the Gen 3 to my original Gen 2 Echo Dot, there is a noticeable improvement in sound; it's richer and clearer.  Every once in a while, what I ask is not understood, or does not give me the results I want. Continued learning curve with Alexa and my lousy Internet may have some contribution here.I have never liked 'Skills'. Sure, there's THOUSANDS of them out there. Remembering the skill name and format of use is terrible. Wind Speed or Stocks Skills come to mind.Vs. Google MiniI still think Google is the smarter of the two, however, it's sound quality is not as good as the Gen 3 Dot.",0
5,"Very useful and easy setup.
  
",22.Dec.19,Yes,"This is my first Alexa product and I_ pretty impressed. The sound quality is decent, but an external speaker is better for music. Luckily Bluetooth works great with this item. The voice control is really nice, but it can be hard to talk to Alexa if there are any loud noises (music, TV, kids, etc.) in the immediate area and you need to yell for the device to hear you. Alexa has a plethora of information some useless and some very helpful, but it_ all there. All in all a great product that can also connect to smart devices to make life just a little easier. Super easy setup and very user friendly. I would recommend to anyone.",0
5,"Never knew I_ love it this much
  
",22.Dec.19,Yes,"I purchased the echo dot as part of the music promo. I never really considered it before but it was a great deal so I thought why not. My husband loved setting it up and I downloaded the Alexa app to get started. It_ super easy to use! I love that I can ask for the weather or have it play my favorite station from the amazon music app.Even my kids love to ask _lexa questions and have her play music. I_e already recommended the echo dot to my mother, mother in law, and siblings. My husband even purchased a second dot a few days after mine arrived so he could have one upstairs.",0
5,"My News Broadcaster
  
",22.Dec.19,Yes,"In the mornings, I say, ""Alexa, Ask the Question of the Day'. And after the quiz, ""Alexa, what's the news"". I have pre-selected numerous news stations so that I get a pretty good range of information. During, the day I will ask, ""Alexa, what's the weather"" to check the current temperature. I'll ask it to play music while in the kitchen or getting ready for bed.Best, I have 2 Dots paired with 2 smart plugs and can say, ""Alexa, office lights on"" and ""Alexa, first plug off"". Very helpful since I have some disability.  Yes. I recommend the Dot (and the smart plug &amp; Echo).",0
5,"So glad I bought it.
  
",22.Dec.19,Yes,"I bought my son the older version A couple years ago. I never really wanted/needed another one for myself. I got a deal on it that was too good to pass up (I figured I could gift it if I didnt like it) and I am so glad I did! I love it! It helps with everyday life so much. From giving me updates on my Amazon orders, to using it as an intercom to talk back and forth from the living room to the kids' area, to entertainment, to dropping in with my teen when he babysitting his siblings, to sending announcements, I could go on. I am still learning new skills Alexa has all the time. I also love the mute button for times I don't want Alexa ""listening"" in. I Would definitely recommend this!",0
4,"Sound is wonky
  
",22.Dec.19,Yes,"This is a nice device and is working exactly how I planned to use it, with one annoying issue. The volume will not remain at the setting I want it to. If I set the volume to five, the next time I use her, the volume is barely audible. I again set the volume back to level 5 and the next time I use her it's back to extremely low. I've tried setting the volume level both manually, using the plus button and by voice, but no joy. But when I can hear it, the sound is great. I have 2 other Alexa devices, another Dot and then Echo and both work great.",0
4,"Pretty Nifty
  
",22.Dec.19,Yes,"I like the product as a speaker, it_ pretty decent for telling Alexa to play a playlist or podcasts on Spotify, which is what I mostly do. It also works as a Bluetooth speaker, which is also really nice.Be warned if you don_ have too great of internet connection, it doesn_ buffer; it stutters really weird. I have it on my end table by my couch, maybe a bit less than the recommended 8 inches from any wall, but it works great 95 percent of the time.I love how clean it looks in the charcoal, especially since I have a darker color table.The one complaint I have is with the notifications. I wish there was a button on the device itself that I could press, rather than having to ask it to read my notifications when my phone already told me what was up (usually Amazon packages).Overall though, it_ great, I love how it works and I_ thinking about grabbing another one for upstairs.",0
4,"Echo is a very good speaker for the price point
  
",22.Dec.19,Yes,The Echo Dot is a very nice speaker for the price-point. I really like the responsiveness of the speaker when you say the wake name. It has three so if you have toddlers who like to play with it you can change the wake word( no more playing) The speaker also has multiple skills so you can sync it with a plethora of services. I synced mine with SiriusXM and Pandora and I love it! The only dislike that I have about the Echo Dot is the EQ. I wish that the trebles and bass were deeper. They work well but depending on the music that you_e playing will sometimes sound hollow. Overall though for the price Echo Dot is a pretty cool little speaker.,0
2,"For what Amazon tries to charge, they could put quality circuits and speakers in these
  
",22.Dec.19,Yes,What can I say? Amazon electronics seem to be made with less and less care or quality. The original echo dot that we own now sounds terrible and has fuzzy feedback anytime Alexa is speaking. The sound quality on this newer generation is not much better and we've only had it for a few weeks. I'll come back and update this review once the speaker has degraded to the condition of our original echo dot. the only time I purchase these anymore is when they're available for 99 cents on some BS promo Amazon's running. I would never pay full price for anything made by and for Amazon.,0
3,"Okay Amazon, Stop Emailing Me About This
  
",22.Dec.19,Yes,"First off, let me say I have an Echo Dot (1st Gen) and an Echo Show 5.  I love both of them.This one, however... Yeah, no.  Not a fan.  It misses half the things I say (unlike the two I mention above) and when it can't figure out what you've said, instead of telling you it couldn't figure it out, it just makes a ""bong"" and shuts off.Sound has waaaaay too much bass.  Seems like this is made for a 15 year old who only plays EDM.Last gripe -- When you buy this, you get an email every stinking week asking you to review it.  Congrats Amazon, here's your review!  How do you like me now?",0
5,"Drop in and Announcment
  
",22.Dec.19,Yes,"I love this speaker, I mainly use it for:1. Intercom to call my kids, it has drop in feature where i can call a particular speaker and talk to them and they can talk to me2. Announcements, i can send messages to all my devices simultaneously from phone to all Alexa devices or i can use one of my Alexa devices to record my message which it will play to all my Alexa devices.3. I can call free to any Alexa device for free4. I can call free to any US phone number for free5. Mic is very sensitive, i can get Alexa_ attention from hundred feet away6. I connect my phone through Bluetooth and it will play whatever my phone is playing7. There are several Muslim apps available in Alexa skills , they play Quran and also can remind you for daily prayers.8. You can play you favorite music to all speakers in the house at once, create a speaker group and play anything on this group9. Pairing and setup is a breeze, 5 mins or less10. Also works with Skype calling11. Control your smart apps and devices by talking to alexaWhat I would like to see:1. Support for Smarthings, I was not able to connect my account2. Support for nest thermostat, seems like there is some rivalry between and google products and they are keeping each other_ product out of their platforms3. alexa should also support VOIP apps like what_ app and messenger, that would be so cool4, facebook integration, i mean why not !!5. I,ll update more once i remember :-)",0
4,"Good speaker, not great
  
",22.Dec.19,Yes,"I had the worst time installing this Echo Dot.  It just would not connect to my network.  Amazon even sent me a 2nd Dot, which had the same issues.  Eventually I connected to my neighbors wifi (accidentally) and then later was able to connect to my own wifi.  I find that the sound is just ""okay"" compared to my full-Echo products, but I bought this to sit in the kitchen between two rooms each with an Echo.... just to ""smooth"" out the sound between the rooms.  I would try again.",0
1,"Firestick + echo dot equals no volume control
  
",22.Dec.19,Yes,"the best part when you finally get it , the tv and your 2 bluetooth speakers hooked up, finding out the volume buttons on remote wont turn it down has got to be the grinch that stole my Christmas.  Basicly bought one and a fire stick with remote that had the volume buttons on it so my dad could just use one remote. Ya isnt happening somebody couldnt actually figure out away to make a firestick volume button change the dot volume when connected to firestick. Im going back to buying a receiver with 900 inputs and outputs so i can do it the easy way.",0
5,"Amazing
  
",22.Dec.19,Yes,"I was checking up on this product for a while but was waiting for the right moment to strike. After the 3rd gen came out I was in total awe and said I'll have to purchase this now. Days went by and I forgot about it and then Black Friday came with the monthly installment plan and didn't hesitate.The dot is amazing, the sound is great and compact. Voice recognition is easy only sometimes she might not understand fully.It's just an amazing device and I'm still in testing with it.",0
5,"Best _ersonal assistant &amp; convenience!
  
",22.Dec.19,Yes,"Fantastic little gem! This was a gift to me for my birthday... and now I_ addicted! I don_ know WHY I didn_ opt for one of these sooner!! The possibilities are endless- especially with it being on sale, you just can_ go wrong! Fairly easy to use, once you get the hang of it. And entirely convenient- it_ like a personal assistant but more! I now have to get my family on board so I can _rop in from afar, lol. But the amount of convenience &amp; help Alexa is totally beats Siri or other _obots. If I could gift one of these to everyone I love, I would! I_l probably end up with one for my office, now, too!",0
5,"Best entry level option
  
",22.Dec.19,Yes,"I had been interested in diving into the whole smart home thing for awhile now. So about 2 or 3 months ago I bought this product, and it was everything I expected and more. I definitely reccomend it as an entry level product, versus the Show and the full sized Echo. That way in case it isnt for you, you only spent $50 versus over $100 for the other products, so it stings a little less. The set up was quick and simple and the voice recognition is amazing. With my small apartment it can pick my voice up from everywhere, as well as I can hear Alexa very well despite the Dot having a smaller speaker. Of course if you have a bigger apartment, or a house, that experience might differ. With the Alexa app on my phone I can control almost all functions for it without having to be at home. This includes setting reminders, calling the Dot, dropping in, and announcements, (great features if you have kids,) setting alarms and timers, etc. All in all, the Dot is a very solid budget/entry level option. It's only drawback is the fact that since its smaller the sound isnt going to be as loud or clear as the other options.",0
5,"She starts my day and ends my day
  
",22.Dec.19,Yes,"I bought this as a Christmas gift but I rated it according to the ones I have. Love Alexa! I start my day every morning when I wake up asking for the weather report. I end my day asking Alexa to set my wake up alarm and turn the lights out. And lots of things in between. I also used it to ""drop-in"" on a friend who left her phone at my house by mistake and there was no other way of contacting her and this worked perfectly.",0
2,"A Google device might be better. _
  
",22.Dec.19,Yes,"My 2nd Gen Echo Dot is better. The audio on this new 3rd Gen is very muffled. Alexa on 2nd Gen is friendlier with responses, etc.  The new Alexa didn't recognize my voice a day after I did the voice recognition session with it.I bought it specifically to enable me to use smart home devices that required Version 3 Echo.I've spent thousands of dollars on Amazon and am very disappointed with this purchase.",0
5,"Does the trick! Great bedside clock
  
",22.Dec.19,Yes,"Does the trick! I needed a new bedside clock &amp; this is perfect - great size, dims down at night so it_ not keeping me awake, controls the lights (smart bulbs) which is handy with an armload of laundry!I haven_ figured out how to handle multiple tasks with a single command (Alexa goodnight = lights off, cameras on, thermostat down, alarm on.) but I_ told it_ possible.",0
5,"Works for playing online music through stereo
  
",22.Dec.19,Yes,"We have a couple of these in the house now and like having them around, mostly for playing music, and annoying the person in the other room by dropping in. :). For the black Friday price, it was well worth getting a couple extras, though I wish the sound quality was a bit better from the 3.5mm jack out to my stereo. Coupled with streaming quality, sometimes it's not very good.",0
5,"Handy and easy to use
  
",22.Dec.19,Yes,This is my 2nd dot. Love them both. Like the style of this 3rd generation. I bought each of mine holders and have one upstairs (plugged in and hanging on the wall) and one downstairs. I use them as intercoms as well as everything else they are capable of. Love it! Also have an Echo show 8 in the kitchen so I can talk to grandkids near and far (Germany) great products,0
4,"Handy little thing!
  
",22.Dec.19,Yes,"Liked all of the features; we do not have ""smart devices,"" so i use it to listen to music, get news/information.One thing that completely frustrated me...I tried to use it at work, knowing it would not connect to our wifi at work.I tried to connect it to my phone's personal hotspot. NOPE.Will try to troubleshoot, but that was really disappointing!",0
4,"Light seems dim
  
",22.Dec.19,Yes,"I replaced an old alarm clock that was reliable but actually seemed too bright when I looked at it during the night.  Now I get one that is too dim during the day.  I have tried turning up the display as high as it will go and it is a little better but the whole idea of light adaptive should be brighter in dim light and lighter in dark to me, it seems that it works opposite.",0
3,"The Dot A Value Personal Assistant
  
",22.Dec.19,Yes,"Alexa can assist with many tasks as a home assistant. Assisting with schedules, making outbound calls, alarms, sounds and playing music. That, she is still not using standardized protocols to limit her integration with smart phones. She has lots of skills but many of them are half baked or don't work at all. She can often be difficult to communicate with similar-sounding words. If you want a rich sounding speaker, then go with full size. The dot doesn't have a rich base tone.",0

",22.Dec.19,Yes,Being new to the echo dot I have no basis for comparison with early models. I have no gripes. The sound is much bigger than Id expect from such a small device. Alexa seems to have a mind of her own...at times she just ignores my questions or commands...Just like a real person. Im used to that so it doesn't bother me too much. I may update my review upon further use.,0
5,"So many great features ! Intercom is the best!
  
",22.Dec.19,Yes,Great product.Things I like:It actually speaks back the reminders as you set it - google home only beeps. This allows me to not only be aware of the reminder but also know exactly what it was for.Drop in is awesome! Intercom in the house!Integration with Ring is great! No need of ring chimeThings that can be improved on in my opinionSound quality. Highs seem to be missingVoice seems a bit unnatural at timesDoesnt hear me when I call out Alexa even though I clearly say itOverall great device!!,0
5,"Best in class Assistant
  
",22.Dec.19,Yes,"I can't believe how good this is. We have had a Google home for a couple years and most of the time it was unplugged collecting dust. Complete pain. Got an Alexa for our bedroom and it just mops the floor with Google home. I can't wait to get the Alexa subwoofer and bring down the house! Very responsive. Using the shopping list, playing relax music at night, reminders and alarms. The usefulness is never ending.",0
1,"Can't control Amazon Fire Cube
  
",22.Dec.19,Yes,"I bought this to add an additional microphone to control my Amazon Fire Cube with, since we usually have to raise our voices very loud for the Cube to hear us. Unfortunately, after receiving the item I discovered that it cannot be used to control a Fire Cube. This should be made more apparent and obvious on all materials promoting the Echo Dot.On the other hand, it makes a fantastic $30 paperweight. I would rate the Echo Dot 5 stars if I were to base my review exclusively on how well it stays put on top of a stack of paper.",0
5,"This little dot packs a punch
  
",23.Dec.19,Yes,"I bought this on a whim - it was on sale and had a deal for a smart plug. I honestly didn_ have high expectations for $30 but thought it might be fun to play with for a while. Nope! This thing is so cool - so cool that I bought two more...one for my bedroom and one as a gift for my parents. Since I_ not interested in having my whole neighborhood hear my music or symphonic quality, the speaker works just fine for me. What really amazes me are the voice recognition, the whisper option, the wide range of skills, and so much more. (My dad_ going to enjoy the old-timey radio shows!) And it_ so small - a great space saver and also doesn_ add to the  electronics clutter. Actually, since this is so helpful, I_e gotten rid of a bunch of stuff like my clock-radio-sound machine and weather thingamajig. The Easter eggs are fun too (though Alexa is not much of a singer/rapper!)",0
5,"Better than anticipated.
  
",23.Dec.19,Yes,"Bought this as an early christmas present for my boyfriend and I. This is our first Echo for or smart speaker so my expectations weren_ extremely high.I am very pleased with the product, the sound quality is great and the speaker it self gets very loud when it comes to playing music. However, I sometimes have to shout for Alexa to respond. We have this connected to our fire TV and ring doorbell. It_ a nice feature to have when my daughter is constantly losing the remote !I don_ like the fact that the device has to be plugged into an outlet to work and there_ not an option to charge it or have it battery operated, that_ a bit inconvenient.All in all, I am satisfied with the purchase. For $25 you get a great quality smart speaker that connects to pretty much anything in your home that is a smart device. Would buy again and recommend",0
3,"Nice hardware, but Alexa has serious catching up to do.
  
",23.Dec.19,Yes,"Let's start with the positive. The hardware is HEAD and SHOULDERS better than Google's Home Mini.  Alexa makes use of the LED display for a clock, temperature readout, countdown timer, and possibly other uses.  The unit feels solid, and materials nice to the touch.Alexa, however, is HEAD AND SHOULDERS inferior to Google Assistant.  My Alexa account is present and viewable in my Dot, Fire TV, and Fire Tablet. And none of them speak to another. ""Alexa, play Classic Rock music on my Fire TV"". Nope, can't do that, but if I speak to the fire TV remote it works fine.  Natural conversation? Google does that ALRIGHT, Alexa doesn't do it at all. ""Alexa, what's the weather today?"" You get a response.  ""How about tomorrow?"" Nothing.  And just a bunch of other random prompts from me that Google Assistant can handle, but Alexa can't.Verdict: if you want an alarm clock with smart features that can play Amazon Music though an acceptable speaker, the Echo Dot with Clock is your Huckleberry.  If you want a genuinely helpful Home Automation Assistant, look at Google's devices.",0
3,"Not as Useful as I had hoped
  
",23.Dec.19,Yes,"Honestly, not certain I am going to keep it, yet.  Voice recognition is fairly good, but you have to use very specific phrases for the dot to understand what you are asking.  The Alexa app drains my phone battery by keeping the location on.  I don't have any other smart home devices, so I am not reaping the benefits of the dot as much as I had hoped.  It is, however, nice on a few levels.  I like adding things to the shopping list via voice command, It would be nice to be able to replace the Amazon shopping list with the list app of your choice, so that you don't have to say the magic words to get it to add to the correct list.",0
5,"Such a great add-on to my life in generaal.
  
",23.Dec.19,Yes,"I bought an Amazon Echo 8 and received the dot for free. I am blown away at how cool it is. You can group them together and play music all over the house. Now I want more of them. I will probably get an Echo Studio because the sound quality on the echo is good, but could be better. I use this echo as the brain of my Tivoli Audio home speaker using the 35mm jack. The echo has replaced my phone as my music streaming device. I have even subscribed to Amazon Music Unlimited because of how awesome the echo is. The ability to link them all together is the best feature of these devices hands down. I also like randomly asking it to tell me a joke and reading me the news from the New York Times.",0
3,"Nice device, won't be using it for my new home, tho
  
",23.Dec.19,Yes,"I bought the Echo Dot since it was so cheap and I wanted to try out devices like this for the new home I'm building. I really like the ease of setup and for weather, alarms, and lists its great. Then I started playing with the music feature and that's when I discovered that Amazon doesn't allow you to upload your own collection of music to their cloud, so I can't play any of my songs, books, lectures on the Echo Dot unless I bought them on Amazon. Well, that pretty much eliminates Echo as an option for my new home. I'll be going with a different manufacturer. Too bad, because I like the Echo. I just can't understand why Amazon went and changed their approach on this and left their customers high and dry. I had a similar bad experience with Kindle licensing and stopped using that device as well.",0
1,"Dies in 90 days.
  
",23.Dec.19,Yes,"I bought two of these between Black Friday and Christmas 2018. I was busy through the holidays so I didn't get them installed until late January. Set up was easy and they integrated with my other smart devices great. I could set times, turn on our of the lights, all the typical ""smart"" stuff. Then by St Patrick's Day they had both stopped working. I had also purchased two of the Amazon smart plugs to control lamps and they also only lasted about 90 days. I don't know if I just got a bad lot of products or if the technology is just not there yet, but I'd stick with other options for now.",0
5,"My second one.  Highly recommended.
  
",23.Dec.19,Yes,"I had one from the previous versions.  My last one worked great and we use it all the time to listen to the radio and control our lights.  The sound on these is not super loud, but it is very decent for the size of the device.  I highly recommend any of these devices since they make it so much easier for certain things such as security in your home.  I have a light that I turn on even when I am very far from home and then turn off before bedtime.I have not opened or used this one because it will be a gift that I am sure will be enjoyed.",0
4,"Alexa does not understand what I am trying to say
  
",23.Dec.19,Yes,"I am very new to using Alexa but I was expecting much more success from Amazon. I'm not saying that it is not working, it works very good and I also integrated through IFTTT. I am using with my smart bulbs and plugs. I will also buy Alexa integrated thermostat and will be using that one. But, if you compare Alexa with Google assistant, Google understands what I am saying even if I do have grammatical errors or accent.I will give you an example. I was asking Alexa the films of Samuel L. Jackson. I tried 5 times and Alexa did not get what I am saying. Then, I check what it understand from Alexa app to provide feedback, I see that Alexa understand: ""films somewhere else"". So, it could not provide any answer.With the exact same speed and accent, I said it to google assistant on my phone, it understands what I am saying at the first trial. So, I am planning to have a google mini next to Alexa and ask google for complicated stuff and ask alexa to turn on/off my lights.Another example, Alexa does not understand if you say: open firetv. Which might not be a perfect command but, it provides wrong feedback message. It says my firetv does not support that feature :/ Then I realized that I have to say: Turn on Firetv :/",0
5,"Great for managing lights, outlets, playing music, etc.
  
",23.Dec.19,Yes,"Have three of these in my house which pretty much gives me full coverage of all the rooms I want to automate. Devices include outlets and various light bulbs -- of different brands. Each brand required either a piece of hardware (hub) or iPhone app -- all of which integrated very nicely with Alexa. I needed to swap all the dimmer switches that I had with regular two or three way switch as the light bulbs do not work with dimmer switch. However, one swapped out, Alexa provides the feature t dim the light bulbs.",0
3,"I rather walk my lazy butt and physically do things than deal with her
  
",23.Dec.19,Yes,"It gives you a lot of expectation, accordingly is a huge disappointment. After weeks of trial I found out how to turn the tv on with her: _lexa turn TV on: _v does not have this function __lexa turn fire tv on - it works so now I have to say FIRE TV, FIRE TV ok bs, just grab the freeking remoate push on button. Alexa rendered useless if tv needs that much work then altering my home is even more annoying (I rather walk my lazy butt to the thermostat and light switch , etc then deal with it!",0
4,"Great addition to the bedroom.
  
",23.Dec.19,Yes,"I bought this to replace an old clock radio that was on my nightstand.  With the built in clock It makes a great replacement and also adds all the Alexa capabilities to my bedside. Connects with the Echo I have in my kitchen so I can sync music in both places. Also plays sleep sounds (white noise, pink noise etc..) so could be replacement for a bedside white noise device. Also it's nice being able to ask about the weather even before getting out of bed. For the price it was a great buy.",0
5,"Alexa is perfect, and so is the Echo Dot!
  
",23.Dec.19,Yes,"The Echo Dot 3rd gen is a great smart speaker. I have it in my room, and also have a smart plug to go with it. I just ask Alexa to turn off my lights, and she does! The speaker quality is really good for this small of a speaker, and works great in my room to project the sound around it. Alexa recognizes my voice 95% of the time, the 5% being when I don_ whisper loud enough in whisper mode(you whisper to her and she whispers back, it_ great for at night!).  99% of radio stations have a way to stream them, and I haven_ found a single platform not supported on the Echo(I_e used stations that stream with iHeartRadio, Radio.com, TuneIn). You can play music from many platforms, like Spotify and Amazon Music. I recommend it, it_ a nice little gizmo that makes life easier. If you_e not sure which Echo version to buy, I_ say the Echo Dot is the best combo of function and price, but if you need a better speaker you can get the regular Echo or Echo Plus. If you want a screen then get the Echo Show or Spot. But for most people, the Dot is plenty good for them and you can easily find it on sale for $25 or so. Great job Amazon and you_e earned my business again!",0
5,"Fun device and sound is great for a small inexpensive device
  
",23.Dec.19,Yes,"The physical device is a great size for keeping on our nightstand.  The microphone picks up our voices from across the room and even through the closed door!  The kids have a blast with Alexa.  Even though the voice recognition is officially tuned to adult voices, it is amazing how well it understands even our youngest with a speech impediment.  They enjoy compiling and playing music playlists, as well as the children games skills and jokes, etc.",0
5,"Why wouldn't you?
  
",23.Dec.19,Yes,"If you are planning to make your house completely smart house, to me it makes no sense why you wouldn't want an echo. The sound quality is amazing for such a tiny device. I like the fact that there so many thing you can pair with and echo. I bought a couple security devices and led lights and even a doorbell. I must say I think I have a weird obsession with futuristic smart devices but so helpful. Living the goooooodddd life.",0
2,"Alexa doesn't understand
  
",23.Dec.19,Yes,"Alexa often misunderstands or plain doesn't do what you ask her. We had a Google home before the echo and it was much better (we changed to echo bc we have Android phones and the Google home and our phones would compete/get confused about which we were addressing). I repeat myself two to three times with Alexa and then just end up giving up and doing the task myself. Also in case you're wondering, we don't have accents or anything that would make it difficult to understand the commands.",0
4,"Try it, you will love it_
  
",23.Dec.19,Yes,"The device has unlimited potential; however, one must research to determine its capabilities. One day I read I could send an audio message to all devices to inform the family diner is ready. When I ask the device to send the Audi message the next day, it can_ tell me how to do it. So sometimes the device will explain how to do tasks yet other times you need to research how to do things.  I guess the best thing to do is keep notes on how to do things that are not frequently done. Overall, I am happy with the purchase as I can play several devices simultaneously throughout the house.",0
5,"You don't need anything more expensive than this
  
",23.Dec.19,Yes,"I love how easy it was to connect  -  like 2 minutes, all done.  She knows every question with a real answer I could come up with.  I haven't integrated this with my other appliances yet.  That will take a little bit of $$ for each appliance, or lights, whatever electric switch you have.  I move it beside my bed at night and ask for music to go to sleep to...I'm gone by 3rd piece.  I got this for 24.99.  It's all the Alexa I need.",0
3,"Wish I had help it don't work like it says
  
",23.Dec.19,Yes,Well I liked somebody else's and that's why it was given to me as a gift cuz I wanted one. then I've had nothing but trouble with it I say Alexis and the blue light comes on but she says nothing back I say Alexis say hello she says nothing and I get tired of trying to get her to answer me I don't know what's wrong so as far as I can tell if my friend didn't have it hooked up to her phone or if she did I never noticed cuz she would just talk to it and it would come on but this one seems to have to be connected to my computer or my phone I didn't think it had two I thought it had to be hooked up to Wi-Fi once it was hooked up to Wi-Fi through your phone or computer that it didn't need to be operated through that device and never seen my friend do that so anyway I don't know this review is not a very good one I'm sorry I wish I could have done better with what I seen you and now what I have are two different things,0
3,"Some work better than others.
  
",23.Dec.19,Yes,"I got two during Black Friday. One was $12! Cheaper than the other. Ok. Fine. But the one I got that was cheaper has far less issues. The first one I got, the black one, constantly cuts out, beeps and stops playing music. The other one does not do that. Thinking I should return it because it cannot be updated or settings adjusted enough to not make it the most annoying thing ever.",0
5,"Great for casual use
  
",23.Dec.19,Yes,"We bought this dot to use in our kitchen. More for background music, and it has been perfect so far. In fact, my husband also used it to sync our outdoor Christmas lights and all we had to do was say ""alexa, turn on outdoor plug"" and they would all turn on! So nice not having to go outside. The speaker is not necessarily high quality, for those looking for a great music sound system but it does the job.",0
5,"Very good
  
",23.Dec.19,Yes,Much better than the first one  speakers has a heavy bass and very loud luv them got one for my niece Christmas gift and check to see if it work .. well .. end up buying one for myself . As a flight crew I would take the one I have at home but now with the new one I don_ need to take it and also no need to take my wireless speakers on my trip because this new one is so good with the sound,0
5,"A Nice Improvement
  
",23.Dec.19,Yes,The newer third gen has a much better audio quality over second gen Dots. The cloth cover looks nice as well.  I_ an Apple device user but find myself migrating away from Siri toward Alexa because Alexa just works better in regard to voice recognition. Remembering how to activate my various skills is tedious. I do like that I can pair my phone to the DOT via Bluetooth.,0
5,"Near perfect voice recognition, surprising number of uses
  
",23.Dec.19,Yes,"Intercom. Control TV. Easy-Access Dictionary, Thesaurus, Encyclopedia, Calculator, Clock, Outdoor Thermometer, Weather Forcaster, Verbal Internet, Grocery List, To-Do List, Notes, etc, all without lifting a finger! I find new uses every day, and there are numerous I have not tried yet! I will probably buy one for the kitchen and one for the second bedroom also.",0
2,"Majorly Disappointing
  
",23.Dec.19,Yes,"Surprisingly poor sound quality considering it_ the 3rd generation of the product. Not a critical flaw for music playing because that goes through Sonos speakers via WiFi in my set up.  When music is playing you need to scream at the Dot to control the volume or pause it. I never had that issue with my 1st gen Echo this replaces. Not sure what_ up with that. Only thing in favor of this product is price, but only because of Black Friday special.",0
5,"Turn any Ordinary Speakers into Bluetooth Smart Speakers!
  
",23.Dec.19,Yes,"I like this because not only does it make any speaker a smart speaker, it also acts as a Bluetooth receiver. So I was able to make my home theater speakers Bluetooth! All I have to say is _lexa connect to my phone and bam, now I can stream music from my phone. That_ a huge pro and one of the main reasons I bought this thing. Highly recommended!",0
5,"Way better than google
  
",23.Dec.19,Yes,We had google mini_ and had a really hard time with connecting them and keeping them connected to all our smart bulbs. With Alexa the sound is much clearer and the connection was so easy!!! To hook up our whole house took less than 5 minutes!!!!! The drop in feature is amazing! So when I want to check I_ on my kids I can very easily!!,0
5,"Echo Dot faster, cleaner appearance, less power, and a great buy.
  
",24.Dec.19,Yes,"We replaced our tall echo series one with this 3rd gen Echo Dot and here are the pros I have noticed and one minor difference in my use case:Pro -1.  Faster. Boots and responds to voice commands more promptly than the series 1 devices across the family.2.  Better appearance. Lights and cloth material appear nicer to me.  Color in this case = Sandstone.3.  Smaller size makes it less noticeable and clears vertical are to the large size echo devices.4.  Newer mounting accessories and options to mount based on smaller size.5. Can be paired together for stereo like audio in a room and also Alexa subwoofer.6.  Less power used. Uses a 15W power supply versus 18W on the series 1 large echo.7.  Less expensive retail price.I_ sure there are more and above are simply what I noticed in first days of use.Only difference I have noticed:The sound quality of the echo dot is surprisingly good as other reviewers have shared. The minor difference is that the echo dot does not have as much lower frequency response (bass) as the larger echo devices.  This can be solved by audio out cable to audio system, pair with the Alexa subwoofer or other.",0
4,"Good intro to Smart Home
  
",24.Dec.19,Yes,"Alexa voice control is a little difficult at first. You have to be fairly precise in what you are requesting Alexa to do. After you get used to that it works pretty well. The integration side of Alexa is the reason I rated it a four. I have had a hard time with Smart lights (Phillips) and my Kindle. The Kindle tends to be slow and not responsive at times. The Hue Bridge works pretty well.Sound Quality is mediocre at best. If you just want background, it is satisfactory. Above that, get a stereo or receiver. Can't speak for the Echo.Because my wife is ill, I bought it to use the intercom feature. Still have not gotten it to work. As I understand it, you have to tell Alexa the echo you want to talk to and then wait for the connection and the other person to answer before you can talk. So it is not just push a button and talk like they make it sound. Not good in an emergency or immediate need situation.Overall, not a bad product, but has a long way to go for really being useful in a Smart Home.",0
3,"Does its basic job
  
",24.Dec.19,Yes,"It's not bad to set up, but some of the more sophisticated uses takes some digging and playing around to figure out. It has lost its connection for some unknown reason on occasion, which is annoying but not a game-ender. It has spontaneously started playing music, triggered by some unknown force. We are surprised at some of the simple requests or questions that it cannot handle or learn. I do worry about how much of unintended conversation or data is being collected and stored in that great concrete bunker in the sky (or Ashburn, as the case may be). Some uses require changes in the volume, up or down, from the current setting. It is a useful novelty...but duplicates the capabilities already present in most smart phones, only with a slightly larger speaker and mic.",0
5,"So much fun!
  
",24.Dec.19,Yes,"Now I have to say this Echo thing is just too much fun. I received an echo as a gift and thought it was an interesting novelty. However when I asked Alexa about a Tolstoy quote and immediately got the answer I was looking for I was a little hooked. Then I started utilizing the echo for weather reports, reminders, tidbits of information during conversation, music, and a whole host of other little fun things this little thing does. I now own three in three rooms and if I want to play music throughout the house I just ask one to play what I'm looking for over everywhere and I have music throughout the house. My next purchase will be an upgraded speaker and I have been buying these like crazy for family members for Christmas.One thing to be aware of. Watch proximity to television as there are commercials on all the time for this Echo product and I find my Echo Dot will respond.",0
5,"Never imagined I would use one of these
  
",24.Dec.19,Yes,"We are not folks to have the latest gadgets. Received this as a promotional item. Knowing now what it is like, would I buy one? Yes!  It is so easy to walk into the kitchen and request whatever style of music you feel like at the moment.  You can request particular songs, or just categories.  I like background music filling the house.  It is nice.  That is mostly what we use it for.  Has a lot of other features.  We try to stay off our phones at home, so it is nice to just ask what the overnight low temperature will be, because online you can get distracted by so many other things and realize an hour later that you still don_ know what the temperature is.  I also like that you can press a button to mute it from listening.",0
5,"Use Two For Stereo!
  
",24.Dec.19,Yes,"After previously owning the first version of the Echo Dot, I bought two of these with the express intention of pairing them together to play music in stereo.  I also assumed the sound quality might be better than the original.  In a nutshell, pairing was a breeze so now music is played in stereo which is very cool.  As for sound quality, yes, it is better than the original Dot but as you should expect, it_ not amazing rather, it is what it is... tiny speakers housed in plastic.  Considering I purchased these on sale (less than half price), I am very satisfied!",0
5,"Great improved Sound and Interaction
  
",24.Dec.19,Yes,"I like the little update from the 2nd gen, I have three Dot's and use them to turn on and off lights and a fanand also enjoy them playing music through out my house, in each room or the whole house at the same timeI use them every day for looking up things or help in spelling, I could go on and on so lets just say there a lot of fun.  Drifter",1
5,"Works great recognizing southern accent.
  
",24.Dec.19,Yes,"I love this little echo dot. I have been hesitant to purchase one for the longest time due to the fact that Siri has such a hard time with my accent, as well as my google home, so I have little faith in Alexa, but she has no problem at all. I purchased it when there was a sale, if you purchased a month of amazon music ($7.99) you got the echo dot for .99, so it was practically stealing and at least worth a shot. There are tons of featured, it works well with our fire sticks on the tvs and the sound quality is very nice and I really enjoy it. Great product.",0
5,"Alexa, where have you been all my life?
  
",24.Dec.19,Yes,"I have 3 Echo Dots around my house and I have them connected so when I play music, my home fills with song. And I finally got rid of my digital alarm to see what time it is when I wake up during the night because I can quickly ask Alexa. I have my home set up to use Alexa to turn lights on and off, as well as my waterfall. Need a reminder while cooking? Alexa has you covered there too. Each week I_ finding something new to use my Dot for. If you_e on the fence, just do it! I was so happy with my first one, I got two more.",0
1,"At this point I don_ know
  
",24.Dec.19,Yes,"I recently purchased 2 Gen 3 I_ not going elaborate because the list is so long it_ ridiculous. Sum up things is that Alexa is stupid I tell her something she says the opposite not all the time but if I_ lucky  she will actually be paying attention when I ask her something. She goes crazy randomly for no apparent reason all the time she acts like she_ her own person because she starts to answer her own questions and then randomly just spits out phrases and words and also she sometimes just starts to say how r u when I_ in the bathroom or somewhere and it_ just me here no body else like she having a conversation. I factory reset her 3 times to see if it would help it made her worse. I thought she supposed to get smarter not dumber now  I want to throw her out the window. I have the fire tv box which is awesome does not do anything like this echo 3rd gen does at all and 15 percent out of the time she works with my fire tv box but almost always she doesn_ seem to do what you guys have which I_e read all many times the instructions, so I unplug her if I want to watch my amazon prime shows  or movies, when I_ streaming music she sometimes tells me to change the song on my iPhone instead of Alexa skipping to the next song when I ask her to, she randomly just stops in the middle of things when I ask her something like she fell asleep. What because I_ to boring I really am shocked on how this echo is bad and did not hit my consumer high point. Sad day for amazon echo product. One more thing is she will pulsate the green light which means a call or a drop in but when you ask here to answer or decline she says there is no call. Did some digging online and could not find anything about it and she still flashes the green light so I have her unplugged because is somebody listening on the other end?? It_ really scary knowing that when this green ring just shows up randomly, what else are you supposed to think about it.",0
2,"Better sound quality vs the original Dot
  
",24.Dec.19,Yes,"Decided to get this because of the current sales promotion. Better quality sound, bugger and more of a modern look. 3 stars was because Amazon had a better promotion a couple of days after I bought them and tried to get a price adjustment. The sales rep copied and paste their policy on promotional pricing which made me upset. I ask if I should just return them and buying again and she said ""yes if that is what I wanted to do"". That response just upset me even more while typing so I just deducted 1 more star... &gt;:|",0
5,"Love this thing!
  
",24.Dec.19,Yes,"I got the Dot on a whim when it went on sale, not really knowing what it does. The set up is super easy and I immediately paired it to my smart thermostat and had it playing music. I have had it for a few weeks now and added a smart plug so it can turn off my lamp, which is great! I got the plug on sale but the regular price is ridiculously pricey so I_l wait to add more when they are low. I know it can do a lot more but the process for acquiring new skills is confusing to me so I will leave it at music, lamp, and heat for now.",0
4,"Super fun, smart, and informative interaction.
  
",24.Dec.19,Yes,"What a fun way to experience AI interaction. Plating games, asking questions, music, trivia.  It hooked up pretty easy, but it got a little tricky doing things like 'family account' so it would recognize different phones.  Amazing stuff, really.  I wonder what advances we'll see in the NEXT 10 years?!  Anyway, it's definitely worth the $25.  But if you are a music junkie, you might want to get one of the higher priced echos that have the better speaker.  But for a small unit, it is pretty impressive.",0
5,"like is so far...
  
",24.Dec.19,Yes,"like the features, setup was difficult for some of my devices (August Door lock, Bose speaker)...  but all switches and outlets (5), thermostat, tankless water heater.  Unfortunately all I can do is turn on/off Bose.  It doesn't support volume or changing channels, but I believe that is due to the particular speaker I have....  Worth getting if you already have other devices to use it with...  I don't sit around and ask Alexa questions much so that doesn't really matter to me....",0
4,"This was my first Echo
  
",24.Dec.19,Yes,"As someone who has a Google Home in every room of the house (minus the bathroom) I decided I should give Echo a try. This deal was too good to pass up and I was not disappointed.While Alexa won't be replacing Google, (I have way too many songs on Google Music to switch) I am satisfied with the performance and my niece actually prefers the Echo for her music needs (I think she just likes Alexa's voice as well as calling her Alexa more than Google).",0
5,"What's not to like?
  
",24.Dec.19,Yes,"Set up was as challenging as plugging it in.  Sound quality is great.  Voice response top notch.  Foot print is small and it is very unobtrusive.  Also have a Google Home device.  Struggling at the moment as to which I like better but as of this review am leaning toward the Echo.  On minor item I very much like is the ability to change the wake word.  Instead of always having to say ""Hey Google"" I now just say ""Computer"" on/off, volume etc.  Reminds me of my youth and Star Trek.",0
5,"Love it!
  
",24.Dec.19,Yes,"I never wanted an Alexa anything. I didnt see the reason to have it, until I got a free Echo dot and a smart plug from my cell phone company. I'm hooked! I never realized many tasks this dot could help with! I love getting a run down every morning of the weather, important events, reminders and tasks, all hands free. I love that I can tell my pets ""hi"" while I'm at work, or put on the tv or a pet station for them if I'm going to be home late.",0
4,"Amazing Device That Can be Most Helpful
  
",24.Dec.19,Yes,"Excellent source of information.  Very handy for use as a timer.  Quick and easy alarm clock.  Music to listen to instantly.  Once you go through the setup procedure and have the dot working properly, don't make the mistake of unplugging it to move it to a different location.  I did that with one of the four that I have and it led to problems in having to go though the setup procedure again and the second time was much more difficult.",0
5,"Big fan
  
",24.Dec.19,Yes,"This is our 5 dot, to go with our 2 first gen echos, echo Auto and echo call.  This last one was for my home office and for a small area the sound is great.  We use the echos a lot in my home for sending announcements like letting everyone know dinner is ready.  Obviously I am a fan of the echo products and honestly the dot is one of the best, each generation the sound has incremental improvements, I honestly think the sound from the 3rd generation dot is as good as the 1st generation full sized echo perhaps even a little better.",0
5,"All the Echo devices that I own work very well
  
",24.Dec.19,Yes,"I have several Echo devices including the Fire Stick. All are easy to configure and work very well. When you get the new device, read the brief instructions completely before you start. Write down your WIFI uname and password and write down your Amazon password. Have your Amazon app loaded on your smartphone. Now start the configuration. It's easy, even the non technical person can get through the instruction.",0
4,"Third one
  
",24.Dec.19,Yes,Have not determined exactly where each one should be placed because as the only one in the house I can't seem to decide whick room is the best for me.  The only sure place is in the bedroom for slumber music.  Now if Echos could just maintain the same sound level for the music.  Some you can barely hear and some will wake you up.  The next upgrade should be constant sound level.,0
5,"Fun to use
  
",24.Dec.19,Yes,I am really enjoying the Echo dot with Amazon music.  It will play music from any year &amp; most any song.  We found a few that Alexa does not know.  She comes on occasionally by herself.  We have not figured out what triggers her.  Sound is pretty good only occasionally is it muffled.  Temps in 50s &amp; 60s are hard to distinguish sometimes.  Overall Alexa is fun to have around.,0
5,"Versatile helper
  
",24.Dec.19,Yes,"We're very impressed with how easy it is to set up &amp; use the Echo Dot. We take it with us when traveling to our vacation home and find that it just keeps working with us after changing the router connection and zip code. Also, surprised to find that it works with our video security system. I am sure that we will connect it to more of our home devices in the future.",0
3,"Tradition means Christian Christmas music first and secular familiars 2nd
  
",24.Dec.19,Yes,This may be Amazon Prime problem  But  Alexa doesn_ listen to me closely  maybe I have to pay more money  But  when I ask for Christmas Traditional Music with or without vocals or with orchestra music only she is lost  Look at Sirius Xm Traditional Christmas music  it is all back in 40 50 60 and early 70ties  it has Ray Coneff singers and Boston pops orchastra Nat King Cole  Percy Faith Perry Como as well as Bing Crosby Frank Sinatra and many other bands and instrumental music  Even the vocals on Alexa don_ carry the good old traditional songs I remember  sorry I_ over 72 and just want to hold on to my youth memories  thanks for asking,0
5,"Alexa vs Google Home: Depends What Features You Want
  
",24.Dec.19,Yes,"Ordered my 1st Alexa Device after I was already using Google Home.  I have to say. Alexa is less prone to false search results and provides more comprehensive local radio station support.  Originally bought Google Home to listen to local AM Rl1080 Talk Radio.  However support was dropped, thus losing the key feature that drove me to select Google Home in the 1st place.",0
5,"Works great with Philips Hue.
  
",24.Dec.19,Yes,"I've integrated it with my Philips hue lighting system and it works great. Additionally, I've tied it to my Sirius XM subscription so I can just tell it to play my favorite stations and boom....there it is. Love it. Constantly finding new things to do with Alexa. I have a google home system also, and I seem to be able to do more with Alexa over the google home.",0
4,"Takes Time
  
",24.Dec.19,Yes,"Pairing the echo with my phone should_e been simple, but turned into a bit of an event. The volume was pretty soft , also, even though I increased it on my phone. Sometimes the device doesn_ recognize a task when it_ already performed it in the past. I_ guessing there_ user issues, to an extent, so being patient and continuing to explore.",0
5,"The most useful part of the smart home for most
  
",25.Dec.19,Yes,"The key things most people want to know: 1. Yes, the speaker built in is good enough to use to play music and will get loud enough for regular use. If you are having a large party and want more than background music and really want to crank it up, this wont work, but to listen to music while cooking or doing something else, even if you like it a little loud, it is fine.2. Yes, you can connect a speaker to it over either bluetooth or aux cableHaving had an Echo Dot for about a year and now having 3 I think they are great. They are most useful to listen to music. If you have prime, it is awesome...'Alexa play country music' will get you a nice mix of country music. In the kitchen it is great for setting timers...'Alexa set a timer for 45 minutes'. It also integrates nicely into the whole smart home but be careful. It took me a while to figure out that smart home devices also use zwave and zigbee to communicate (as compared to bluetooth or wifi), so if your smart devices use zwave or zigbee, you also need a hub. I have a Samsung Smarthings hub and it integrates nicely into my smart home, which is only semi-smart. We have about 6-8 smart switches, 5 smart outlets, smart front door, 3 echo dots, 2 echo buttons (these suck) and 2 Samsung buttons (buy these instead for buttons).",0
5,"Indispensable for dementia or Alzheimer_
  
",25.Dec.19,Yes,"Bought for my mom. She lives in an assistant living facility.  She wanted a CD player to play classical music while she oil paints.My mom has moderate dementia which means she forgets to go to her exercise class, meditation class, jewelry making class etc. I set it to remind her 10-15 min before her classes/activities begin so she gets there on time.Alexa /dot has been the perfect companion for my mom in so many ways especially with dementia. Recently, the dot has become even more indispensable. Mom fell and broke her arm in two places therefore, making it a project to get up off couch and answer phone before it stops ringing. I can just say _lexa, drop in on mom_ dot and mom gets a little sound notification and mom and I can just talk to each other hands free and without her having to get up from couch, chair or bed. Mom absolutely loves loves her echo dot. She plays music, asks Alexa about the weather , time, jokes,news and so on. I love the dot for all the joy it seems to bring her , but mostly how much it_ improved my mothers quality of life and how much it_ helped me to help her.If you have a loved with Alzheimer_, dementia or any handicap involving not being mobile ... You need this in yours or your loved ones life!",0
5,"There have been two periods of my life;
  
",25.Dec.19,Yes,One was pre-Alexa and the other was Post-Alexa. I bought this one for my kitchen so I could use timers and also start up my Amazon Alexa enabled Microwave (also a great product). I play games in the skills section while cooking or washing dishes. While making coffee and breakfast I get the news and weather. The Dot hides on a shelf and isn't seen which is fun. If I get in the mood to hear a song while eating breakfast well Alexa is there to play it for me. The sound quality is great for such a small speaker. I even bought one for my girlfriend and she loves it. The fact that you can tell Alexa to add things to your shopping list is great and why it should be in every kitchen. Amazon you have changed my life. I added in Alexa enabled light bulbs and even turning the lights on and off (including the stove light) is all done by voice and hands free. From my bed or the living room I just tell Alexa to turn off the lights in the kitchen if I forget to do it when in the kitchen. Buy one for every room you will use it in every room and it has a purpose in each room. What you get out of the Dot far surpasses what you pay. It is a bargain.,0
2,"Awful Experience, Unusable
  
",25.Dec.19,Yes,"Brought this for my parents and it has serious issues that make this unusable.Pros:Sound quality is greatLooks niceHas a clock on the frontCons:Setup is not easy, if you are a technical person it still takes a minute to get it connected. It could be a little bit easier.Doesn't allow adding additional voice recognition. For example, it recognizes my voice mother's voice but not my dad's voice. It says to add additional voice download the app to a 2nd phone. That only works if you have a smart phone, my dad has a flip phone and barely knows how to use it. They need to have a household voice recognition option, that actually recognizes an individual's voice.The voice recognition will do any female voice but not a male voice and vice versa, not a true voice recognition.It doesn't allow you to play your customized playlist on Amazon Music, it plays what it wants.The internet consantly disconnects my mom's phone from the internet now, whereas before it did not.When it finally connects it plays a song for 10-15 seconds and then shuts off. That defeats the purpose of what I brought it for.",0
3,"ok but...
  
",25.Dec.19,Yes,"It's ok but the thing I noticed different from also having the 2nd gen, is that it takes longer to respond to you and sometimes it don't at all, so that's why I only give it 3 stars. I like the look of gen 3 better but I actually prefer the gen 2 over this one because of it's quick response and it can hear you better from far off. I almost thought about just returning the 2 new dots that I have but since they no longer have gen 2 available, I'll just hang onto them. Thought about trading in the older dot for new when I was buying the new dots, now I'm glad I didn't!( I'm not for sure if the 3rd gen echo dot is worst or it's my hotspot, being that I just found out that I'm maxed out on my hotspot. I have the new google nest mini and google nest hub now also and I'm having the same problems with it not working as well sometimes, no response at times.  It could be that this dot works just fine if you are using it with a good internet setup. So I really can't say for sure it's not as good, this has just been what I'm experiencing with this dot.)",0
5,"So impressive for the size
  
",25.Dec.19,Yes,"I_ blown away by this hockey puck. We_e a solid Apple household primarily for privacy concerns. I got this for free with a promotion and I can_ believe how much nicer and easier to use Alexa is compared to Siri on my HomePod. Alexa is personable and warm. My wife hates Siri and won_ use her for anything. Within a few days she_ warmed up to Alexa.All that being said, I absolutely don_ trust amazon with 24/7 audio recording in my house. I do like that you can disable the mic with a single button press, so that_ nice. If we start talking anything serious like finances, I cut the mic on the dot.I am very impressed with the sound quality. It_ not as good as my HomePod, but it_ miles ahead of my iPhone and and good enough for normal use. For Apple Music, the HomePod is king simply because the dot can_ compare due to its size. I may actually buy some more echo devices with better sound (echo plus perhaps) since we can get Apple Music easily on the echo.",0
5,"Impressed
  
",25.Dec.19,Yes,"My house has been an Apple house, with just about everything we have that is automated hooked into Siri. That works out okay for basic stuff like turning on light. But there hasn't be a lot of development in that area and there's not a lot of apps that would be useful to me that work with it. It also poses a problem when you have more than one person with Apple devices in the household. My husband's HomePod drove me nuts, taking over my ""Hey, Siri"" meant for my iPad or iPhone when I was trying to get something done for me. So I decided to try out this Echo Dot to see if it would help sort out some of the confusion - and it does!I don't have a lot of music attached to my Amazon, but Alexa has access to some free selections and radio stations that aren't too bad. And the Echo Dot has a great sound to it for being so small. Alexa also seems to be a little smarter and a lot more entertaining with the trivia games you can play with it, plus some of the other skills it has. I haven't had it for too long, but I am really enjoying it.",0
2,"Doesn't play well with Pandora or Spotify.
  
",25.Dec.19,Yes,"Got an Echo Dot for each of my kiddos for Christmas, primarily so they could listen to music in their bedrooms. I was under the impression the devices would pair with Pandora and/or Spotify--and it seems they do, sometimes, for some people, but so far not for us. Each time I ask Alexa to play a song in Pandora or Spotify, she tells me I need to link my account and enable the skill. I've done this, multiple times now. The Alexa app shows that I've linked/enabled both services, but it still doesn't work. Annoying.",1
3,"Very disappointed
  
",25.Dec.19,Yes,"Both my mother and my sister have an Amazon Alexa. I'm not sure if mine is broken but for some reason it has trouble recognizing my voice when I call her name. It does not always understand what I'm saying to it, it might think I'm telling it something completely different. Her voice comes out slightly muffled which makes it hard to understand. But the worst part is that occasionally she just seems to freeze when I asked her command and I'll try to ask it again but it will not go through and then she just seems to shut off all the way. I then have to unplug it and plug it back in for it to work. I'm very disappointed I have a feeling mine might be defective because my sister and mother do not have this experience. I don't really have the time to return it and go through that process so I am just very disappointed right now.",0
4,"Works great, but needs a little tweaking.
  
",25.Dec.19,Yes,"Alexa has a wide array of available integration devices on the market that allow you to make an easy transition intonation smart home. I use Alexa with a smart TV, smart plugs, and smart switches. The device easily controls all of your peripherals in your home. The only thing I have issue with, after you set a routine or phrase, it must be said exactly to the word or the device doesn't recognize it.  If you have the volume set to anything above 8, it is difficult to interrupt music or actions that are happening. I'm satisfied with everything that I've programmed the echo to do. It just needs a little tweaking to be perfect.",0
5,"nice!
  
",25.Dec.19,Yes,"I got this as an add on to another purchase (which I haven't received yet)  Wasn't really looking to get another one as I have 2 echo dot second gen's and a echo 2nd Gen already.  They work good.  I will say that the echo dot 2nd gen's don't sound good enough to me so i added a sound amplifier to both of those and they sound better now then the full size second gen echo i have!  anyway, I will say this, the dot 3 out of the box sounds much better than the 2's!  I won't need an amplifier for this thing.  So, since it was free...it's going into my workshop so i can listen to music out there!  Win Win!",0
5,"AMAZING life saver!! This device is awesome and can do so many things! Worth every single penny!
  
",25.Dec.19,Yes,"My children ask me SOOOO many questions all day and evening. It's a lot with juggling full time mom, full time work, raising minions. The kids ask Alexa things now and it's SUPER helpful to me. This device can do so many things. I've shown my friends, family, informed co-workers whom donate currently own one of what these amazing devices can do. Music, recipes, setting alarms, setting alarms to wake up to music, Christmas music, asking dumb questions, etc. You name it, this thing probably does it. It's truly a life saver and it's very much worth every penny. I wish I had purchased one sooner!!",0
1,"Not good for multiple users on same account
  
",25.Dec.19,Yes,"I have two children with dots, my wife and I each have a dot and we have a plus at a vacation home.  App only allows two accounts (Prime).  Teens and children can not have separate Echo accounts.  So all the devices connected to my account are limited.  For instance, only one device can play a different Spotify tune at a time.  So if I am playing a song and they want a different song, mine will turn off.  I can't use guard (the security system) on just the Echo at my vacation home.  I spent over three house with tech support and the only answer was to set up my kids with their own Prime account (that I have to pay monthly and they would lose access to our audible account).  I guess it works well if you want them all to do the same thing.  It also messed up audio button on my iPhone, for which tech had no idea how to fix.",1
5,"for the money
  
",25.Dec.19,Yes,"it is the shiz. do NOT think that it does stuff on its own, you will still need to buy into the alexis eco system, but it the starting point and get one for every major room so you dont have to shout. I got three for a relatively small house and it has saved me tons of money. I combine it with the smartlife eco system (plugs, lights and such) and it has been amazing. Look, for the price (i believe like 30 bucks) this device has been a steal and a life changer. BUT AGAIN, DO NOT THINK IT IS A STANDALONE DEVICE, YOU HAVE TO BUY LOTS OF ""SMART"" STUFF.",0
5,"Pretty cook
  
",25.Dec.19,Yes,I got a bunch of dots for Xmas and initially I was disappointed. Sometimes it would respond great. Other times it couldn_ understand me. A few trouble calls with amazon and nothing was working. Finally started paying attention to what was happening when she wasn_ responding and it wasn_ Alexa_ fault at all. My internet provider really sucks. Made them repair the cable/internet line and now my upload speeds are what I pay for and Alexa works great. Alexa can_ respond to commands that don_ get uploaded.Now she and I are very happy together. My family uses drop in so no more screaming across the house when the kids needs to do their chores. I just drop in and say _ooper scoop.I still don_ know all the things she can do but am looking forward to learning them,0

",25.Dec.19,Yes,"This is my first Alexa product, and it_ fun!  I was able to set it up, and have it playing music in 5 minutes (maybe 4 minutes, lol).  In the four hours that i_e been using Dot she_ recognized every command, and performed flawlessly.  Time will tell whether or not she_l perform as well as my initial interactions, but as a semi tech-savvy person my estimation is that I_l have more of these little babies, and will eventually upgrade to paired speakers and other Alexa products.",0
1,"Stupid
  
",25.Dec.19,Yes,"Love all the echo loving reviews.  The truth is, its a dumb box.  If that works for you, great.  Just not there, and to imply its better than that, is a lie.  Its okay.  I find myself repeating myself a lot.  Plus, I'm already sick of, ""can you repeat that"", ""I don't understand that"".  Yes, I repeat and I do the exact same way, and magic...it works.  NOT THERE.  When it works cool.  FYI, only use this for music and, some timers.  The main problem does seem to be music request.",0
5,"Best Smart Device I Ever Had
  
",25.Dec.19,Yes,"I had bought these for others who loved them but I didn't get one for myself until now and I don't know why I waited so long. I have several smart items and the Echo Dot with Alexa has made it easy to get them all connected and working together in one place. Plus the Dot is great for setting timers &amp; reminders and providing a wealth of information quickly and concisely. And I can also do all of this from my Samsung cell phone. As you can tell, I highly recommend the Echo Dot.",0
5,"Works as I hoped it would
  
",25.Dec.19,Yes,"I bought this to put in the living room so we no longer have to yell into the kitchen to communicate with Alexa. We've also started using it, in combination with other Alexa speakers and the Echo Input, to play music all over the house. There is no lag with the Alexa ""music everywhere"" option, which solved the problem I was having trying to use bluetooth to broadcast music everywhere.. The Echo Dot sound quality is quite good for such a small speaker, and perfect in combination with our other speakers.",0
5,"Alexa echo dot 3rd grneration
  
",25.Dec.19,Yes,"I like that with a simple small device you can automate your entire house. You just have to buy the compatible extra devices for that to make the connections between what you want to make to work. But the Alex itself has already many functions, says weather, reminders, calendar, news, music, etc. I bought for my husband and at the beginning he didn_ seem to like but now he_ enjoying  a lot! You need to have Wi Fi for all the devices work with the Alexa.",0
4,"A great device which needs improvement
  
",25.Dec.19,Yes,"I have 4 of these devices around my home.  Some are more sensitive to sound than others, you must be connected to the internet to use things like sleep sounds, and there's still no search capability.  That being said, I love this device for its convenience, capabilities, and potential.  I do recommend one of these for people who are blind, it was instrumental in assisting my former boss in many different things.  As far as the whole ""its always listening"" thing, we don't say anything at home that would interest anyone at all.  Why would they care if I'm making truffles for Christmas, or what music I listen to?  If you make an effort to stay away from trouble, trouble doesn't find you.",0

",25.Dec.19,Yes,"I love everything about this.  I'm elderly and alexa is good and useful companion.  She is clear and easy to understand  She answers all my questions and always sets the alarm perfectly.  i don't know what else to say, I love it and it is well worth the money.  I would recommend it to anyone of any age.  I got the easy set up from Amazon, all I did was take it out of the box and plug it in, that's all!  I didnt even have to set the time, she did everything.  Hats off to Amazon for an awesome and useful tech product.  Thank you Amazon!",0
4,"What time is it
  
",25.Dec.19,Yes,"I have enjoyed the echo dot so much. I wake up during the night and just have to ask ""Alexa what  time is it"" and she tells me.  I dont have to look for my phone to see the time.. I just ask.It was my great grand daughter's birthday..I said ""Alexa sing happy birthday to (name)"" she sang it to her and she even got dogs to bark Happy Birthday song to her... My great granddaughter was so happy.. she is 3 and now she wants me to ask Alexa to sing all the time.. ________ if Alexa doesnt know the answer she will tell you she doesn't know the answer..",0
4,"Works great for music, but spoken word is too bass heavy
  
",25.Dec.19,Yes,"I have a bunch of 2nd gen echo dots. While this 3rd gen does have overall better sound for music, I believe it_ at the expense of everything else that_ not music. It seems a bit bass heavy, which for the spoken word isn_ that good. So when Alexa responds to you, it doesn_ sound as clear as can be. I believe the 2 gen echos do a better job at non-music sounds, which is what I mostly use Alexa for.If you don_ listen to music on your Alexa device, the 2nd generation echo dots are a bit clearer and cheaper.",0
1,"Not happy!
  
",25.Dec.19,Yes,"Alexa keeps turning off. I say Alexa play holiday music, she plays a couple of songs then turns off. Another instance was we were listening to music and there were weird sounds then she stopped playing.  She wouldn_ turn back on with awake words so I had to unplug it a few times. Another time we were listening to music and the music started to get louder and softer by itself. Not impressed, got it for free thank goodness.",0

",25.Dec.19,Yes,"It's and echo dot and performs as it should. My biggest surprise was how much my wife liked it. She is one who doesn't really like high tech much, but she loves having the ability to command music on demand. It's connected to her portable bluetooth speaker so she can carry it throughout the house. I also purchased two Wyze smart plugs so now she can control her xmas lights by voice as well. Happy wife, happy life. Thanks Alexa.",0

",25.Dec.19,Yes,"Yes yes and YES!!! Amazon has done it again! I purchased in pink for my daughter who is 11. It is a Christmas gift and I cant wait for her to open it.

",25.Dec.19,Yes,I THOUGHT THE DOTS WERE LARGER IN DIAMETER BUT FOR WHAT IT IS IT LOOKS AND SOUNDS VERY GOOD. I ACTUALLY LIKE THE DESIGN AND THE PETITE SIZE IT IS. NO ISSUES WITH IT AT ALL. IF YOU DONT HAVE ONE OU SHOULD REALLY TRY IT. I USE TO USE YOU TUBE FOR RELAXING MUSIC TO HELP ME FALL TO SLEEP BUT NOW THE VIDEOS STOP PLAYING AFTER ABOUT 20 MIN SO I GOT THIS AND BY VOICE YOU CAN INSTRUCT ALEXA TO PLAY AS MANY HOURS AS YOU WANT. AND AN AWESOME ALARM CLOCK AS WELL.,0
5,"I was a complete skeptic, paranoid, non believer...
  
",26.Dec.19,Yes,"When I first got it, She wouldn't do anything, you do have to use the app and go in and build her ""personality"". For the first couple of days I thought I was going to return it. Then I sat down with Alexa and the app and spent about 30 minutes going through all the functions and options.I am 47 years old, was diagnosed with a morbid case of diabetes when I was 45 and have been horrible about taking my insulin and checking my blood sugar on a consistent time line, which is crucial. So, I set reminders in Alexa to tell me ""its time to test your BG"", It is time for your short acting insulin (3 times a day) and at 11pm she reminds me to take my long acting insulin and Lisinipro for the evening.  Because of Alexa reminding me, I have gotten my A1C down from 9 to 6.5. That is an invaluable feature for me.Then, one day, I had a song in my head and just said, ""Alexa, play ""Like a stone"" by Chris Cornell. And bam, she plays it. I do have the Amazon music subscription which I think you need in order for this to work but I have not been able to think of a song or artist that she cant find and play within seconds. My Chocolate lab ""Copper"" loves the song ""Baby Shark"" so I set a ""routine"" and all I have to say is ""Alexa, what does Copper like?"" and she jams Baby Shark for him while he bucks around the living room having a blast.I have been playing Trivia battle every single day. She makes lists for me so I don't forget things I need for work. She sets reminders for me so I don't forget appointments and other important things. You can say ""Alexa, set a reminder on March 15th that my brothers birthday is tomorrow, or a week from now, or, whatever you need.I learn something new that she does every day and went from one of those paranoid skeptics to a total believer. In fact, I got a second one for the living room and have them linked. She will read E-books to me while I work. I am a history buff and I can say, Alexa, tell me about Abraham Lincoln, and she will go on and on with just about any historical question or figure. She does math, she tells me what my weather is like currently and what it is going to be like through out the day.Honestly, I love this device, I have a white one and a black one, one is called Alexa and one is called Lexi (so you can drop in from room to room with music or conversation) Just the improvement in my health with the reminders she gives me has been a life saver, not to mention I don't forget things anymore because when I think of it, Ill set a reminder and Alexa and Lexi take care of it.I know a lot of people think ""oh, that thing records everything you say all day and it is an invasion of privacy"" well, that is incorrect because you can turn it off (red ring) and really so what if she listens to what me and my wife talk about... IF she is, all she hears is what we are thinking about eating for dinner, what's on Netflix or Amazon Prime video and us playing with our dog.I cant recommend this device enough, when I leave the house, I say ""Alexa, we are leaving"" and she has particular parameters that she listens for (breaking glass, doors getting smashed in) when we get home I say, Alexa, we are home and she says ""Okay, I will stop guarding the house for now.Get one and try it, you wont be sorry.",2
5,"Works well, I was able to ""lose"" my clock.
  
",26.Dec.19,Yes,"Between several chargers (for phone, tablets, watch, etc.) and the items that go on the chargers, I also had a clock and a dot (2nd gen) on my nightstand. I figured getting this dot would allow me to get rid of my clock. I am a little worried about an alarm not going off if we lose internet, but truly we almost never use alarms and when we do, we usually wake up just prior to the alarm going off anyway. So I have only used the alarm once, and turned it off prior to it even going off anyway. So I also don't really know how well the snooze option works, but assume it would be fine. The brightness of the display is nice, very visible during the day but at night (bright and dark times, not really night or day) it lowers it's brightness nicely and is not too bright. So, so far it is working well as far as the clock part goes. As far as comparing the gen 3 versus the older gen 2, I would say first off, I am not audiophile, far from it, but compared to the gen 2 dot (not echo) the gen 3 seems to offer not only louder volumes, but also clearer and crispier audio, not that I would only buy it for that, but some might. The only thing I wished for, was that it came in more than one color, I would have preferred black, like just about everything else on my nightstand, the color is not bad, it just sticks out more because everything else is darker on my nightstand. Maybe the clock part wouldn't work as well with a darker color, not sure, but on that note, the clock is very easy to read from across the room, so no problems there.",0
5,"Decent, great for the price...
  
",26.Dec.19,Yes,"So I finally broke down and entered the world of _mart speakers. Got tired of the wiring mess with my 5.1 system. Having to try to integrate a surround system with a Firetv Stick. Have 3 different remotes to run all and have the wife keep up and use it all confidently.I purchased 3 of these and an echo sub. I tied two with the echo sub and a 4K Firetv Stick. _heater.Setup was actually pretty easy. Had it all up and going in about 15 minutes once the speakers had updated to the latest firmware.Sound wasn_ too bad......but it was not what I needed for my main TV watching area. The sub helped tremendously but the system sounded well, just not what I wanted. I also purchased two echo 3rd gen speakers and WOW! Much better. (Reviewed under those speakers).I did however, order 3 more of the dots as well (6 total). I installed one in our master bathroom, master bedroom, garage and 40_50 building. For listening to music in the background they work pretty well. Setup is a breeze. I have 3 different _roups.As far as sound, I will say they aren_ terrible. Much better than a couple of other blue tooth speakers I have. Obviously the small size limits the bass, but they will fill an area for listening. There is no comparison to the echo 3rd gen or echo plus but common sense should tell anyone that.They_e great for certain situations and places. For the price (on sale at $19-$22 ea.) they_e pretty good. Not sur if I_l buy more of these or just wait for the echo 3rd gen_ to go back on sale and buy those.Still......NOT BAD little speakers!",0
5,"Good interface with Alexa ....
  
",26.Dec.19,Yes,"I luv these echo dots. I have one at the house and I luv it so much, I got another one for the weekend house.  It's a bit tricky to configure the wifi smart plugs to turn on the light with the same name (ie kitchen light) at different locations.  However, this is an ""Alexa"" issue and not the echo dotdevice sincee it has the geo-location capability.The echo dot devices themselves work well.  I placed the device in the dinning room since it is central to all the spaces in a small house.  I can give Alexa commands from anywhere in the house with this setup.I used the echo dots to turn on the lights in different rooms, the night light in the bathroom, or the LEDs on the Christmas tree.  I also tell Alexa to set the temperature on the wifi enabled thermostats to turn on/off the heat.I don't have any electronics or clocks in the bedroom, I just ask Alexa for the time when I woke up in the middle of the night.  Some people may find this creepy since Alexa is constantly listening for commands.  I am OK with her.One command I use a lot is the timer.  I cook and do tons of task at the same time so I use Alexa to remind me of things.  I also ask Alexa to play Christmas music since the speaker in the echo dot is pretty good.The echo dot device is a good interface with Alexa to do things in a ""smart"" house.  The microphone and speaker are good quality.  The low profile and small size make it less  intrusive although Alexa is constantly listening.I always inform my guests of the device when I have visitors.  If the guests are uncomfortable with Alexa constantly listening, I simply unplug the device.  The ""constantly listen"" creepy factor can easily solved by legislation.For those Alexa haters, don't get these wonderful echo dot devices.  You can continue to gather firewoods to burn in your cave to keep warm at night, or you can tell Alexa to set the temperature to 75 degree in your comfortable house.  Your choice!",0
1,"Pretty much useless going to try echo plus
  
",26.Dec.19,Yes,"I bought a 55' amazon fire TV and an amazon echo dot for my wife who is paralyzed it simply doesn't work 50% of the time sometime's it will turn the volume up but not down sometimes it will turn the volume down but not up most of the time alexa just says fire TV dosn't support that but it dose because it works sometimes alexa won't turn the TV on or off at all Most of the time alexa won't switch the TV inputs for some reason a lot of the time I'll give alexa a TV comand and she'll turn on my Xbox iv gone through the alexa app were it lists what you said to alexa and what she did in response and you pick if alexa responded correctly alexa is supposed to learn from this but she doesn't and the alexa app rarely lists the commands she got right so basically Alexa has been pretty much worthless except for setting alarms, timers &amp; turning my Xbox on &amp; off which I have on a shelf out of reach it should be noted that a Amazon echo dot cost about $25 where a Amazon echo plus with built in hub cost $150 a big difference in price and probably a big difference in quality so I'm going to bite the bullet and try the echo plus I wouldn't bother normally but like I said my wife is paralyzed and if Alexa worked as advertised it would change her life a lot O and don't bother trying to make phone calls with Alexa she'll make the call but you can't hear the other person talking and the receiver only hears bits &amp; pieces",0
3,"Not sure what I'm reviewing here
  
",26.Dec.19,Yes,"I mean, 5 stars on the Dot.  Let's say 2 stars for Alexa and the software.  I bought this primarily as an alarm clock to replace my 10yr old Motorola droid :)  Alexa OS alarms give you 3 recurring options and 3 options only.  Every Day, Weekdays, Weekends.  So if you have a flexible sleep schedule you're screwed.  You can say ""Alexa cancel today's alarm"" and that works, but if you aren't 100% sure if you maybe canceled a different day there is no way to tell.  If you ask ""Alexa, when is my next alarm"" the answer will always be ""You have a weekday alarm set for 5:15am""  I plan on complaining about that officially but who knows if they'll care or implement it.  Using the phone app to check on your alarm gives you no more information than Alexa herself did.  If you don't currently use Alexa at all, keep in mind she's dumb as a pile of bricks.  Google is a lot smarter and I'll assume Siri is too.All that said, I like the clock just fine and have no plan to return it.  I like being able to ask her what time it is, when my cat is in his usual spot on my bed...with his butt between me and her.",0
5,"My new alarm clock!
  
",26.Dec.19,Yes,"I had been using the Echo Spot (now discontinued?) as an alarm clock for a little less than a year when the screen begin flickering on me. Luckily, Amazon gave me the option to exchange for a new Alexa device and I chose this Echo Dot w/ Clock as my replacement. I've been using it for couple of weeks now and notice a big different in the audio quality of the Dot over the older generation's Spot. The sound is much clearer. Responds to command with no issues. Some people complaint that the clock face is a bit too bright and is non-adjustable. I do wish it were adjustable but luckily I don't find it disturbing my sleep at all --- it's not too bright, but would definitely be ""bright"" for sensitive sleepers.Edit: Right after I posted my review, I went into my Alexa app and found out that I can actually adjust the brightness of the clock display. I had it on adaptive setting; no wonder I didn_ find it bother me at night! This makes this device even better!",0
5,"Amazing to have with Alexa. Even worth the money just as a bluetooth speaker honestly.
  
",26.Dec.19,Yes,"This thing is awesome. If you can get past the idea of something listening at all times (I'll admit it is an odd thing) this is so cool to have for so cheap.Very rarely has it ever misunderstood us or not known what to do. Any music/channel available on Amazon Music can just be asked to play and it will. Pandora account channels can also be played from. The sound quality is better than literally ANY bluetooth speaker you can get for this cheap (yes it is also a bluetooth speaker).Alexa is pretty sweet to have in your house. The Dot will have a yellow ring on it for notifications so when you notice you just say ""Alexa play notifications"" and they can be anything from Amazon Shopping stuff to you or any friend setting up a notification for you. When I need to remember something I just say something like ""Alexa remind me to bring in the garbage cans in 30 minutes"" and it will beep, say it, and show a notification on your phone.People in the house, or even away from the house, can call in to the dot, or dots in other rooms can act like an intercom to other dots.I also did some smart home automation. It came with the outlet, and I added a DC switch, water main valve servo, and flood sensor. My water main will shutoff if there is a flood, and I can just tell Alexa to turn the Christmas tree on/off. There are skills for Alexa that listen for break-ins and also ones that make it seem like you are home with sounds, talking, and turning things off/on randomly.If you want the smart home features make sure that whatever service the device you get uses has an Alexa Skill to link it up. If something says it needs a hub and doesnt mention direct Alexa connection DO NOT get that if you dont have that hub. I have a few things and just to give an example they use Kasa, eWeLink, and Smart Home which Alexa can link to those accounts and control them. What this means is you will have accounts for each of those apps and Alexa will go through the internet to control those with their accounts. (That is my understanding, so no control with no internet).I took a star off of Alexa Integration, because even though my devices show in the device list, they do not show in the create routine menu (place to make a series of things happen). I worked around this so far since the smart home apps usually have their own routine makers. This could be a deal breaker if you get the wrong devices as Alexa would be the only common account to try and utilize the devices in series, but it can't. (Maybe I just dont know how to fix it, but it isnt hurting me for now). Another workaround would be IFTTT (If This Then That) is a service (somewhat complicated to figure out) that allows linking various accounts and making routines. This is somewhat hit or miss though as companies need to pay for support and some may only check device statuses like once every 30min to save money.",0
4,"Not another useless gimmick
  
",26.Dec.19,Yes,"Many times these devices come along and you really don't see anything really useful for it but when you are a severely disabled American Veteran as I am and if just walking around in your own home can be hazardous to your health, by setting up wifi sockets and wifi outlets which manage lights throughout your home then you can see how devices such as this is quite literally lifesaving. Many times I will get in bed while leaving the bathroom or hallway light on but by putting these wifi devices in these areas I can then ask Alexa to turn them on and off, also depending on which wifi light socket you get, you are able to set the brightness on a regular normal light bulb. When I get up in the morning I have Alexa to turn on the bathroom light, the living room lights and my smart tv, I can even use Alexa to set the volume on the television which is great considering how the volumes are different from each HDMI port. This is especially helpful if you lose your remote or don't feel like walking to get it if you had placed away from yourself. Depending on the wifi device you get to set it up can be easy to tricky. I would strongly advise anyone who is having problems setting up their wifi devices to go to YouTube and search for a similar device if not the same one.",0
4,"Love Alexa, but...a couple of things
  
",26.Dec.19,Yes,"In general, Alexa (echo dot) seems to be working well, and I love the music.  It's not loud enough to carry throughout the house (not a problem) but is great in the room where you are. I requested a couple of pieces which would force me to buy Amazon Music at some $$ per month as they weren't available in the basic library, I was disappointed by that.  But the worst thing is that halfway through Messiah yesterday, the music started to stutter and Alexa hung up and was unresponsive.  I unplugged her, and plugged her back in, and everything was fine except I didn't get to hear the rest of Messiah.  The great thing was I discovered I could play the local NPR radio station.  So I haven't yet tested the ""drop in"" feature which is one of the reasons I bought multiple echo dots, hopefully it will work.  In general, I love the echo dot.",0
5,"Awesome little voice recognition speaker. Great for playing music, checking the news and weather etc
  
",26.Dec.19,Yes,"I recently gave my echo dot 2nd gen to my daughter and she uses it to listen to music and play games in her room, I was going to buy another 2nd gen one to keep in my kitchen but I started reading the reviews on this one and decided to take a chance on this one instead. I made the purchase and just opened it for Christmas. Ever since I took it out of the box everything has been a breeze. Setup was so easy because it automatically synced with my account making it to where I didn_ have to use the app or anything. In fact, I like it sooo much I just ordered a second one for my bedroom!! Sometimes she has a hard time hearing me and recognizing what i say but I  Love Amazon products and devices and have never had an issue with anything.",0
4,"Largely an entertaining device.
  
",26.Dec.19,Yes,"I got this as an experiment.  I have been using the google equivalent and wanted to compare. They are very similar in a lot of ways. I found that there are more entertainment options on this device. What do I mean by entertainment? Games you can play, a celebrity voice, integration with Audible, and the like. I particularly enjoyed the Starfinder game which is a choose your own adventure style audio RPG.It controls the same sort of smart devices as the Google version. The build quality is really nice and the audio coming out of it is loud and clear. Where it falls behind is in voice recognition. I had to repeat myself a few times while using the device. I didn't have to repeat a whole lot, but enough that I noticed the difference. I will also say the level of information available from google is just greater so doing search was better there.All of that said, I think the Echo Dot is a good device and I would be comfortable with giving it to friends and family.  It is useful and fun.",0
3,"A lot of sound from a little package!
  
",26.Dec.19,Yes,"This was given to me by Travelers Insurance Company to test an Agent Messenger Skill. Set up was confusing but that could have been brought on by me because I really didn't want to attach it to my personal Amazon account. I proceeded anyway having to download the App on my phone and visit the Amazon website. Once connected to our office Wi-Fi, the sound is incredible coming from such a small device. I'm not a big fan of being so connected and it attached to my personal Amazon account. Besides, who knows who's listening with these devices. Everything can be hacked these days! I really only use it to listen to a local radio station, so I'm not sure how much longer I'll keep it connected.",0
3,"Good for music, muffled speech hard to discern
  
",26.Dec.19,Yes,"We liked our first generation Echo Dot, so when the newest one went on sale for $22 for Christmas we purchased one to get a ""new and improved"" model. Alexa's voice on the new one is best described as muffled, sometime to the point of being unintelligible. My wife is not at all happy with this. We never had this problem with our old one. Attempting to adjust the EQ in the Alexa app had no affect on this muffled speech problem and seemed to only change EQ parameters for playing music. By the way,  music does sound better on the 3rd generation DOT. Still, for a newer model that should be an improvement, Amazon took one step forward (music) and two steps back (voice) on the new Dot.",0
5,"Buy now!
  
",26.Dec.19,Yes,"I love it so much I bought another one! It recognizes my voice from other rooms.  It's nice to be able to ask the time/weather/etc when I'm busy.The unit is small and unobtrusive. The sandstone one blends in nicely with any decor.  The sound is great; has some nice bass.  (We have a small Bose and the sound is as good if not better.)  The dots are set up to play music individually, or collectively.I'm saving my pennies to get some smart plugs to further integrate our home to the dot's  program.  We have one plug already; it turns the light off/on when we ask.Can't wait to learn more about it!",0
2,"Speaker improvement
  
",26.Dec.19,Yes,"The speaker in this 3rd gen Echo Dot seems better than in my 2nd gen Echo dot which is a good thing because it often loses bluetooth connection with my Bose Soundlink Color Speaker.  Almost never a problem with my 2nd gen Dot.  The Bose announces it is connected but the Dot says it is having trouble connecting (even now) and on the app it is searching constantly.  So if I don't want to hear my expensive Amazon music through  my Bose speaker, then it is okay.  We have several Echos, Towers and Dots, and smart plugs throughout the house so I am not new to this game.  For the sale price I paid, it is just okay.",0
3,"Interesting ""upgrade"", but not 'better'
  
",26.Dec.19,Yes,"In my opinion, the new 'dot' falls short on two fronts: 1) the original dot used USB type power adapter and cables. This allowed you to use longer or shorter cables and USB power hubs to great advantage. Now, it's a wall wat with a long cord and a barrel connection. A step back I think. Not great. And, 2) The audio was supposed to be improved... but it is more muffled and overall just not as solid.  It gets batter the louder you set the volume, but that is 't always the right effect. even with the audio controls built-in, the setting s are weak.  The Gen 2 is a better all-around unit.",0
5,"Small and powerful speaker!
  
",26.Dec.19,Yes,Great sound! Very easy set up and great music selection! Ask Alexa anything too. There_ a mute button for privacy also convenient to get the weather .. The only thing I was not crazy about is They tend to repeat the songs especially while I was using it during the Christmas season and also if I put on smooth jazz they play the same music over and over... wish Alexa had more of a selection of old fashion Christmas songs... I pay a monthly fee I think $4.95 a month for unlimited music it is well worth it however there are ways around this by downloading the app so I_ told.. will try it,0
5,"Love the Quality
  
",26.Dec.19,Yes,"We've had a Dot forever but decided to upgrade to one with a clock.  I love this little Dot.  The sound quality is so improved and the Alexa App includes sound adjustments of the bass, treble, etc.  The light on the clock can be adjusted and there is a feature which allows the light to adjust automatically according to the ambient light.  When we ask for the current temperature, it is shown on the dial.  When our alarm goes off, we can either tell Alexa to snooze or stop or we can tap the top of the Dot.  This is a great unit.  We love it!",0
3,"Instructions would be nice.
  
",26.Dec.19,Yes,"Even though I can build databases, I could not figure out how to set up this device without research! Once plugged in the unit says its ready for Set Up, but doesn't tell me how. The little folder of 'instructions' is not much better. I'm told to download the Alexa app, with no instructions of how to do that. I would have thought I'd be downloading the app onto the Echo device, but not so.  It seriously wouldn't have been so hard to tell us in the instructions to download the app onto a phone!  Many others have had the same trouble, as evidenced in the Q&amp;A section of the product page.",0
4,"Very nice ""hands-free"" assistant and entertainment center
  
",26.Dec.19,Yes,"Having seen Alexa in action in my daughter's kitchen, I was happy when this one arrived.  Thanks to pretty good set-up instructions, and very good technical support from Amazon's Alexa Support Center, I have been able to start enjoying Q&amp;A about all kinds of ""searches,"" as well as connections to our Smart Thermostat, and most recently, the blu-tooth enabled speaker (Oontz Angle 3) I bought, which significantly improved the sound quality.  Among other pleasures, Alexa integrates my Skype subscription, so that I can use voice-recognition to call anyone in my Skype contact list without lifting a finger, and take advantage of the Echo's (and Oontz's) speaker-phone capabilities.",0
5,"Worth every penny
  
",26.Dec.19,Yes,"I held off on Alexa for a long time but finally decided to get one when Amazon was hosting their 99 cent deal with Amazon Music. I was really missing out on this thing. I use it for a lot already.I have it connected to turn my Xbox on, my office lights, control my smart outlets, etc. Feels great to come home sit in my chair to relax and ask Alexa to turn my stuff on, browse for my show, play it, dim the lights, etc.Best yet the speaker on this Echo is actually really good for music. It's not going to be as good as the bigger Alexa devices, but it's still superb. The volume goes very high.I'd recommend this in a heartbeat.",0
5,"Love this little device, why didn't I buy it sooner
  
",26.Dec.19,Yes,"OK, I've been keeping my eye on this device but felt I didn't really need it.  But we wanted to listen to a couple of radio channels (including our local public radio station) that live stream in places we didn't have a radio.  AND, I love Audible books and wanted to listen to them before I fell asleep.  So when the 3rd gen and pre-Xmas specials came out I bought them.Very easy to set up, very nice sound and I've found more to uses it for.  I'm still searching for some nice relaxing apps to add to it.  One wave sounds were too noisy and had a notable click when it repeated in about 1 minute.  Ugh! Not relaxing.  I'm still considering whether to pair it with my new smart TV.  And, whether to take it with me on vacation.",0
3,"Great device, terrible Amazon streaming policies
  
",26.Dec.19,Yes,"We love the speaker, but you cannot stream music from the same source on two different devices. So, with my 3 Alexa devices, I can only stream one song at a time from Amazon music (that pay extra for!). The only way around is is to set up SEPARATE music accounts for each device. Not worth it. I hope Amazon changes this because I know of a few  people who are switching to Google Home because of this. I have family members ghat received these for Christmas and they_e going to be frustrated when the first fights breakout between the kids and what music they stream.",0
1,"Privacy concern. Will not recommend
  
",26.Dec.19,Yes,"Sounds IS GREAT... but the device not so. And I stopped using it, because found that it does not protect enough privacy. The app navigation is not transparent enough, and the default features enabled are tricky... unless you search for them, which you must know what you're looking for, this is privacy concerns. It will be great that on set up, it goes with the user on all the privacy features si that user is aware of what it allows. I found the current strategy to be misleading.Will not recommend .",0
4,"A handy companion
  
",26.Dec.19,Yes,"The speaker has a pretty good sound quality until a certain volume to where it sounds like it could blow out. The voice recognition seems to work for the most part, but it will occasionally misinterpret some commands. I can_ tell you how many times I tried turning off my lights with a voice command only for it to turn my TV off instead. Which leads me to the next point, the integration. I was actually pretty surprised how hands-off a lot of the integration was save for providing some account access to Alexa via phone app, but from there I_e been able to do a lot. It has me excited about expanding the smart network at home and the different interactions the devices can have. The major downside to this is that it could start confusing certain commands with a different device and who knows what kind of awkward results can stem from there. What_ clear is that this technology is making great strides in making life more manageable and although it_ not perfect, it certainly works.",0
5,"The echo network works very well in our home
  
",26.Dec.19,Yes,We have an echo dot in each major room of our home.  This serves as a very effective intercom system plus all of Allexa's information services are available throughout the house.  We also have an Echo Connect device linked to our phone system so that we can place voice activated calls from any room in the house.  This could be very helpful if someone falls or has an emergency.  Unlike medic alert necklaces and wrist monitors this does not require that you ware something.  It works with just anyone's voice.,0
5,"All of Alexa in a tiny little package.
  
",26.Dec.19,Yes,"We bought 3 echo dots during their 3 pack sale recently. While they may not have all the bells and whistles of their larger counterparts, you could definitely just have echo dots around your house and be comfortable and confident your getting a good Alexa experience. Our kids love to play games with her, and ask her questions, and jokes. We like to tell her good morning and get our fun fact for the day, then have her start reading us the news, it_ become a morning routine. It took a minute to realize I could attach more than 1 music application to her and call them out by name and she would differentiate between which I wanted her to play. She will even play a specific playlist on my Apple Music if I call out it_ name followed by _n Apple Music. Same with SiriusXM, call out the radio station. She does kind of struggle with my 5 yr olds voice, but my 5 yr old has an issue with articulation and any AI is going to struggle with that. I was initially going to put the stars down to 4 under voice recognition for that purpose but thought not to, because it_ not a design flaw, more a simple quirk in my small child that she needs to grow out of. I did want to write it in my review for those that might want to get something like this for an older family member that may have a medical issue and couldn_ articulate well because of a stroke or other reasons. Alexa seems to be adapting to her slowly, but she will probably grow out of this stage before Alexa adapts to her.",0
3,"Looks Great, Sounds muffled
  
",26.Dec.19,Yes,"I purchased the Echo 3rd generation and upon connecting , I foiled the sound to be extremely bass heavy or muffled.  I contacted Amazon who duplicated my issue on their end with the same results. The equalizer in the Dot does not make much of a change except for raising the volume.  Amazon sent me a replacement Echo 3rd Gen unit but it had the same issues.Granted the new Echo is a lot more attractive than the original. The clock is an added plus. The ability to ask the new dot certain questions and have them performed is quite interesting. It will reset the EQ , adjust the EQ settings, set the brightness level and sound level just by using your voice.  Amazon explained it might be fixed in a future upgrade.All in all I_ ok with the unit.  Good luck",0
5,"Cool
  
",26.Dec.19,Yes,That was my kids favorite Christmas present. They don_ leave Alexa alone. Alexa doesn_ hace the best voice recognition and often understands completely wrong. I have things added on my. Art that they didn_ even ask ir said and I_ supervising. My teen is in love with this but she has trouble sometimes with Alexa understanding.Uf. And useful but also tricky to do settings.It has a good sound for tiny body but I could do way better. But for 25bucks is prefect.,0

",26.Dec.19,Yes,"I love my Echo Dot!! I use it mostly for listening to music, but I like it so much that I bought 2 more !!  It sounds great! It_ easy to use and connect as long as you download the app. My kids do other things with it like jokes and games it_ really impressive what this little thing is capable of! It even seems to have learned the speech patterns of my youngest who is autistic and has speech issues! Alexa understands most of what he says now!",0

",26.Dec.19,Yes,"Setup is fairly easy, but since I'm pretty tech-unsavvy, it took two calls to tech support to finish the process.  That's an operator error issue that someone with more knowledge would not have.  The sound quality is excellent, I think rivaling more expensive sound systems.  I have connected two Smart Plugs to control living room lights.  I will add a second Dot in the basement so I can play my 60s mix there while my wife plays her Country songs upstairs.",0
4,"Secure?
  
",26.Dec.19,Yes,"Hello all. I have and still hear and read horror stories about how voice prints and ongoing conversations are kept on servers and / or in the cloud. Still, I was given this product as a gift and find it really fun and easy to use and integrate with the small number of 'smart' devices I have at home. How secure it is? I have no idea and so far, have experienced no negative or 'scary' incidents described in the media. Lots of personalization to go and experiments to do with respect to functions or 'skills' as they call them.",0
4,"Some issues with it.
  
",26.Dec.19,Yes,"When I bought this I spent hours trying to set it up. Finally gave up after it would not work. I then called Amazon and they spent a lot of time with me trying to get it to work. Finally they found the problem. The box was never open however the serial number is on bottom of box. Some registered this item and then returned it back to the store. So they had to un register it so I can get my name on in place, then I was able to proceed.  Another thing is if you like Elvis on xm, it will play channel  19 for a while then throw you in to another station.",0
5,"never thought Alexa and I would be friends
  
",26.Dec.19,Yes,I never thought I'd like this but I figure Google's looking in on me anyway no matter what I do. I like the fact that I can get radio stations in my house on a.m. that I can't get on other devices. Yes I can get them on my computer but I don't want to sit in my office. Also I'm starting to use the shopping list more frequently. It's really helpful instead of looking for scratch paper all the time. Great Christmas present from me to me,0
2,"So Disappointed
  
",26.Dec.19,Yes,"I had not expected much from the maligned Flex and a lot from the Dot. I received the Flex first and was happily surprised, but very disappointed when I got the Dot. I have to almost holler for it to hear me and it sounds as if it responds with ALL bass, so you can't understand it. It may be great if you are getting it to add to your music sound system. I am going to contact Amazon and see if I got a defective one.",0
5,"AALEXA IS LIKE TALKING TO A PERSON, FANTASTIC AND INCREDIBLE
  
",26.Dec.19,Yes,"I always heard about Alexa, and I was curious to see how it worked.  I ordered mine recently and I was so surprised on how Alexa sounds and recognized my voice.  It took me a while to install it, but it_ not that difficult.  I am glad I bought my Alexa, she even wake me up with music _ _ .  She sings for me and is always so cheerful.  I know I still have a lot to learn on how to use it.  I love _ Alexa_______",0
5,"Super nice for office_
  
",26.Dec.19,Yes,I bought this for the bed room but decided to use it in the office. It_ paired with my echo and is a perfect desk speaker with clock. Takes up minimal space. The clock dims with changes in light.  I am sure Alexa will be a great assistant when I go back to work next year _ I did buy another dot for the bed room. Both dots with the echo are a super little whole home stereo system with intercom!,0
4,"Terrific product, with some bumps in the road.
  
",26.Dec.19,Yes,"Echo Dot is an unbelievable value at the price, and the simple instructions in the box got ""Alexa"" up and running in no time. After that, getting integrated with music-on-demand (and following up on Alexa's best offer for Amazon Music) became a chore. I imagine younger, more technically astute customers would have known that one has to use either paid unlimited Amazon Music music or paid Spotify (vs. the free versions). But, that being said, asking Alexa about the problem yielded nothing, and technical support told me my router might be bad (not the case). After searching online cleared things up, Alexa's original Amazon Music price offer for one device was hard to recover--and required a call to obtain--since other (higher) subscription prices run simultaneously. While Echo Dot is a terrific product, it could provide a little more basic support, along with more consistent pricing information about the music service.",0
5,"Amazing
  
",26.Dec.19,Yes,"Omg I just love it, and so does everyone else in my house including my 3 year old niece who is constantly telling Alexa to play baby shark lol. I will be buying more for other rooms in the house. On some reviews I seen the speaker wasn_ loud enough I don_ see how it isn_. The sound is perfect. I have her in my kitchen and she can hear me all the way in my Livingroom and I can hear just fine",0
5,"Impressed.
  
",26.Dec.19,Yes,I have the google home mini already and had no intentions of buying anything alexa related until this was gifted to us through sirius radio subscription service. I have since decided to do away with my google home and replace it with everthing amazon alexa related. I love it. The voice recognition is superb in comparison with the Home and Alexas capabilities far exceed what I was even aware any A.I. in the home could do. Impressed and certainly happy with this little device.,0
5,"Love it!
  
",26.Dec.19,Yes,I_ very impressed with the dot. I have one of the _ther  brand as well and much prefer this one. Clear sound. Good voice recognition. Only complaint is all the _lerts it has for me. It gives me Lots of recommendations on how to use it. But I can see how some people would find it more helpful than annoying. Very small complaint. Overall a great purchase!,0
3,"has times when it keeps searching for voice
  
",26.Dec.19,Yes,"Sound is good, good interaction.  I have already had to reboot it several times by unplugging it and resetting it.  At one point it wouldn't stop searching for my voice and the light ring kept going on and off. A simple power reboot didn't work and I left it unplugged for over 24 hours before it would work properly. I'm not sure if I am going to keep it.",0
4,"Decent, mild problems.
  
",26.Dec.19,Yes,I switched this one over to recognize _cho. I didn_ want to be triggering my other dot. I found that it does not recognize Echo as well as Alexa. I would have to ask Two or three times before it finally did what I asked. I switched it back to Alexa and it_ working better but I swear my gen 2 echo dot is way better and far more consistent.,0
5,"Nice little echo
  
",26.Dec.19,Yes,I like the clock feature.  It helps declutter the nightstand.  The clock light dims when you turn out the lights so you don't have a bright light blaring at you.  The sound is better than on the 2nd generation dot.  If you want real good sound you will need to connect it to better speaker.  It does all the features of all the echoes,0
3,"The Good and the Bad
  
",27.Dec.19,Yes,"I purchase this Dot (and 2 more) for my kids room so they could each listen to their own music, this is where the Bad comes in.  They are not able to listen to different music on our Amazon Prime Music account, only one device can in  control or the Music on Amazon Music. Unless I want to create them all separate Amazon accounts, which then I will need to manage and then invite them to the Amazon Unlimited Family Plan, which as you can guess cost an extra $149 a year.  Kind of a rip off if you ask me.Now that being said, here are some good things...They can each listen to different iHeart radio stations and/or Spottify account.I can now sync them all together and play the SAME song through out the house pretty easily.The sound out of just a little device is great for the size.I purchased them on a Black Friday deal and they came with smart plugs.So, Amazon, time to give back and allow people to stream different music from our Prime Music accounts  on different Amazon devices (dots, echos, shows) without gouging us for more money.Other than that, I like them.",2
5,"Great Product !!!!!
  
",27.Dec.19,Yes,"You had my expectations about echo dot and Alexa, so far they were all overcome.A robust and excellent quality manufacturing equipment, to be one of the basic equipment its sound quality when playing music in a room or dining room of regular space is heard excellent, and if we add the equalization function available in the app you can achieve Interesting improvements in the quality of audio reproduction.Pro:-. The interactions, speech recognition and the text to speech engine are incredible.-. The generation of routines integrated with Skill, helps to reduce several functions or interactions in a simple command.-. Excellent Audio Quality-. Integrations with Online Music Services.-. Accesible price.-. Simple integration with electronic equipment.Cons:-. The maintenance or development of skill is very poor.-. Many available Skill do not work properly.-. The skills available or to be developed must support at least two languages _(English / Spanish).-. It does not support some way of working offline, in case of connection failure to the internet.-. It does not yet have integration with messaging systems like WhatsApp, Telegram, etc.-. It does not yet have integrations with VOIP systems other than Skype.",0
2,"Better options may be available for you
  
",27.Dec.19,Yes,"As a speaker it_ better than the old ones. But if your using this only to give voice commands may I suggest the new (cheaper) echo flex? This little thing plugs right in the outlet, and has no bulkyness to it, no cables and adaptors etc.If you are planning to use this as a (secondary) speaker, than sure its better than the flex, but terrible compared to bigger Echo_. I think with the arrival of the flex this actually became almost redundant in the Line up.If you are planning to connect this to your stereo with a 3.5mm jack, than yes that will work. And if your on a budget then it_ the best option for you.  But if you have more to spend then may I suggest you buy the Alexa Link, together with the flex? It has a much better DAC (Digital Audio Converter) and also the option to go out optically to a high end DAC. The big plus of the Link: you can switch between your tv audio, Alexa, and another output (I connected the google audio to it with an optical cable) all without ever having to switch channels on your amp. Love that feature. Really great advantage.",0
5,"8yo has SO much fun with this, definitely recommend.  Very easy to set up.
  
",27.Dec.19,Yes,"I really wasn't sure about this purchase, I didn't know much about these Alexa things and my 8yo had never even mentioned one for Christmas.  But I'm so very glad I bought it!  She has an absolute blast with this Echo Dot and it was definitely the hit of Christmas day after all the presents got opened.  I really thought there would be more to setting this up but it's very easy!  All you need is Wi-Fi, of course.  I downloaded the Alexa app and within minutes it was all set up.  My daughter figured out in minutes that it will actually play fart sounds, lol, go figure.  She kept saying this thing will do everything.  We even played kids trivia and it asks you how many players then goes around asking you all questions.  I can't believe this thing was only $25!!Edit:. I didn't know what the Smart Plug was for so I ordered it as well, then later learned it's so you can plug a light or something into it so you can tell Alexa to turn it off or on.  So, you definitely don't need it, unless you want that option.",0
5,"Awesome device
  
",27.Dec.19,Yes,"This amazed me honestly. First I will say that had this not been on sale for a dollar (plus a month of amazon music) I wouldn_ have bought it. Once I got the Echo out of the box, it was set up in minutes. I have mine in the living room beside my Xbox One. I found the skill on Alexa_ app to be able to control the Xbox, which is super useful. I can play music to make the room more lively which is always nice. The sound quality is very good considering it_ such a small package. I don_ keep the volume up normally past 8 as it loses clarity, but it_ not a deal breaker. One cool feature I found out was that you can connect to external sound systems with a line-out connection which I will be doing soon. I will probably never use amazon music as I have Apple Music, but this is able to link to Apple Music. All in all I_ say this is more than well worth the price and especially with it being on sale. If it broke today I_ jump on amazon and have it replaced immediately.",0
4,"Life savior
  
",27.Dec.19,Yes,"A characteristic treat of an autistic child mom is that we become a ""broken record"". We have to repeat the same routine time and tie again. Day after day. Only for the reminders option, Alexa is worth her price. Period.I don't really have many skills on her, I basically use her to control lights/smart plugs, music and our routine reminders.My main complaints about Alexa is that I would like her to be more ""understanding"". Sometimes you or the kid asks her something and you keep getting the ""I don't have an answer for that"" or ""I don't understand"" kind of answer and is a little bit annoying.Plus, I would like an option of English &amp; Spanish (Spain) combo language, not Latin. Latin Spanish Alexa sure won't understand some commands. No offense intended but Latin &amp; Spain has very different accents and vocabulary.",0
4,"Not always reliable with smart home and hub links
  
",27.Dec.19,Yes,"It is not uncommon to have to repeat commands that require action with the smart home links such as outlets and light bulbs even though Alexa repeats back the command exactly as given but no action actually takes place.  Example: ""Echo, turn on lights.""  Alexa responds back with the same command content, but the lights do not come on.  I repeat the command again, and the lights come on.  Similar experience with the Harmony Hub commands that control my TV and Theater sound system.  I know my network is working with huge bandwidth (Gbit), but I cannot speak to how these device links work over the WIFI.  If they are actually communicating over the local network with each other, there would not be any excuse for this type of activity or lack thereof.  I can't speak to how the various devices (Harmony Hub, MajicHome, and KASA) communicate with the Echo Dot.",0
5,"Very good
  
",27.Dec.19,Yes,"We do enjoy using our new Echo but her voice is very loud, we can turn up and down, but if you play music it not so loud, even when you say ""alexa turn it up"" or ""alexa volumn 5"" it sounds a bit muffled. We wanted to rename it but it didn't give us a choice other than; Alexa, Echo, Computer,.. but thats ok. And it does guard the house though we forget to tell it to most times. I am glad I bought it, it helps to keep my daughter on time with meds and teeth and school and all sorts of things, i can get weather anytime. I did notice though when i ask for it to play a certain musician it plays the same list every time.. and i have to ask her to skip music, when i told it i don't like a song it still plays it. But still a very good product!",0
5,"Wow!
  
",27.Dec.19,Yes,"I can't believe Amazon was having a Facebook promotion for this item and guess what, I took up the offer.  The first thing I want to say is Alexa was so easy to set up.  You do have to download the Alexa app to run it but it's worth it.  I have set up an automatic weather update for every morning since I'm not a TV person.  It scares me some mornings because I forget it's set.  But I have not had any issues with it besides the voice recognition.  Sometimes, Alexa picks up the TV voices and says the most random things.  It also picks up other voices in the home that are not linked to it.  I'm guess Amazon is working on that but I do like it and would recommend it.  I will be ordering another one very soon.",0
3,"Sadly Disappointed with the Display
  
",27.Dec.19,Yes,"This is my fourth Echo device, third Dot. I enjoy having Echos, using them, and find them really useful. But with the Echo Dot with clock, I feel like I was sold a bill of goods. I saw advertised that you could display time or temperature. I want to be able to have the temperature always displaying. The only time the temperature shows up, is when Alexa is telling me the weather, then it goes back to the clock. I have not found a way to display temperature as the default setting.On the plus side, the sound is a huge improvement over the second generation Dot. It is incredible how much better the sound is, but the size is only slightly larger.The engineers did a great job on that.",0
4,"huge learning curve. and needed family music plan
  
",27.Dec.19,Yes,"we got 3 echo dots and 1 echo show for Christmas. huge learning curve. it took us two days to figure out how to let the kids listen to music in their rooms (make sure you turn on your explicit filter, parents). i had to make the kids scripts that told them ""(alexa, computer, echo, amazon), play (song/artist/genre) from (amazon, tune in, i heart radio, spotify) on (specify name of echo dot in their room"", because you can't play amazon on more than one echo at the same time, and we loooove music. so before you start your free trial, decide which trial you want, because you can only get one (family or unlimited). only with the family plan ($14.99/ month or $149/year) can you plan amazon on more than one echo at a time. today we ended up switching over to paying for a month of family, and will likely purchase an annual after that.",0
5,"Best small speaker ever!
  
",27.Dec.19,Yes,My parents have an Echo Dot 2nd generation and were not very happy with it's low volume and audio quality but I decided to order the Echo Dot 3rd generation due to the great bundles deal with Amazon Music Unlimited and I have to say I was so impressed I had to bring it to their house so they could see how amazing the new generation is! The audio quality is far superior to anything else this small and the volume is magnificent. I'd easily pay the retail price to get another so they can enjoy mine.,1
3,"Not bad
  
",27.Dec.19,Yes,Elexa answers question but if they are umm risky in anyway she just says something like . I don_ know that one. Anytime you ask to play music they will play free music but it_ not the exact song your always looking for but it is the artist. It always mentions to pay the $3.99 per month for Amazon music. Then you can play any song you like. At night time the light around it is always flashing which I do not like. It_ in my room and I have been unplugging it at night time but then I_ not able to see what it_ like for Alexa to wake me up to music. I bought two of them at $24.99 so for the price it_ a good buy. We_l see how it goes. I thought it_ be more fun but it_ ok.,0
5,"Convenient, simple set-up, good sound
  
",27.Dec.19,Yes,"I_e resisted this long, but finally got first Amazon Echo Dot with Black Friday deals.  I_ only using a fraction of what it can do so far, but have found it to be so convenient, I bought 3 more for Kitchen, Living Room and Bathroom (1st one went in bedroom).  Love just being able to ask them to play whatever music I like or ask simple questions I would have grabbed the iPad to look up before.  Easy to set up and sync with bulbs and Amazon outlet to really make life more convenient.  Sound quality is better on larger model, but this is more than adequate, and great when multiple Dots synced to play as group and fill the house with music.  Wish I bought sooner.",0
5,"I'm a fan
  
",27.Dec.19,Yes,"My husband has wanted this for a long time. I've been so against it . Now that it's here and I've read up on its features I love it! We now also have the Ring security camera.  That came with a Dot as well. Now we use it as a intercom. No more screaming around the house. I have a disability and now I feel more secure knowing I have Alexa should I need help .The downside is that everything runs through your homes wifi. If that goes down, nothing worksAlso, my 3 yr old granddaughter learned to say ""Alexa play baby shark.""Bottom line is, now I'm a fan and plan on adding more devices.",0
3,"Works well...but plug in, no USB. Liked Gen 2 better!
  
",27.Dec.19,Yes,"Honestly I don't use my Echo to listen to music. I have some Yamaha's for that.  This ""new"" dot need 15w and a PLUG.  It doesn't sue USB so I can't plug it in where my others dots are (ie USb distribution at computer desk, USB charger on the coffee table, USB at Craft desk). I'd rather have more Mics and less speaker,...and USB powered.  I mostly use thew Echo to turn lights on and off, and control my environment.  I have a weird muscle disease, and occasionally have difficulty moving....and even paralysis.  Voice is the last to go...so I do LOVE the DOTS,  (7 of them).  Just my personal preference.  (FYI: Ask My Buddy...works)",0
5,"Alexa becomes almost a member of the family
  
",27.Dec.19,Yes,"Alexa is always willing to provide outside temperature and time, both locally and other locations of interest.  She also serves as an excellent alarm clock and timer.  And, with appropriate smart plugs, will turn lights on or off when requested.  She also answers most question as a verbal encyclopedia as well as providing a vast library of music (with pretty good audible).  They can become so handy that you may find yourself with more than one in various locations around your home.  We now have five, and the dots are almost as good as the more expensive models.",0
4,"Good for what it is. You will want to upgrade right away.
  
",27.Dec.19,Yes,"The sound quality is terrible compared to my other speakers. I have a cheap Philip's speaker and a cheap logitech that sound better than this thing.It works ok with Apple music, you need Amazon music for it to work properly.The Alexa feature is awesome though. We check the weather and news on it almost every day on it but, dont buy this to stream your music. I feel like music sounds very flat. My 20 dollar logitech x100 puck speaker blows it out of the water and it is 4 years old.Voice recognition is great on it.",0
5,"Love the dots.
  
",27.Dec.19,Yes,"I now own 7 of these. I use them for whole house music and running smart devices (about 45 devices, including switches, locks sensors, thermostats). They are not Bose or Sonos quality, but they are a fraction of the cost. The software is still a little glitchy but it gets better as time passes. Definitely not a home entertainment system but if you want to play the same music in all your rooms and you have a bit of patience, this works for a fraction of the cost of the systems claiming to do the same. Not to mention, it has a lot of other cool features.",0
3,"Not what I was hoping for.
  
",27.Dec.19,Yes,"I was hoping to replace my JBL flip travel speaker with this, but it doesn_ sound nearly as good.its only marginally better sounding that the version 2. The high end is muffled and indistinct.  it_ not much smaller than the jbl. Maybe it_ even larger with the dedicated power wart.  There_ no internal battery even though it_ heavy. I hate the nonstandard power connector and outsized wall wart. To top it off, there_ not even an aux in. I_l keep it and use it. But I can_ use it as my travel speaker. It was a real disappointment.",0
3,"If You Want To Play Music, This Is Fine
  
",27.Dec.19,Yes,"But if you expect Alexa to do other things, disappointment awaits.  First, the voice is so muffled I can varely understand it in a quiet room.  Second, it will turn your lamps plugged into a wall socket on and off, but won't dim or brighten them.  You're stuck with whatever bulbs you've got in there.  Third, its weather reports are spotty and may or may not be accurate.  (It told me it was sunny this morning while rain came from a completely overcast sky.I think it has a way to go before it's truly useful.",0
5,"My favorite new gadget
  
",27.Dec.19,Yes,"I love this echo dot.  Got it on sale for $24.99 and I've been telling everyone who doesn't have one to consider purchasing.  I bought smart plugs to pair with it to control my night stand lamp.  Works like a charm!  Can control the light when I'm not at home even with Alexa app.  Voice recognition is accurate, speaker quality is really good for such a small unit.  Love the alarm, routine and reminder set features.  User friendly and totally customizable.  Get one if you don't have one.  You'll love it!!!",0
5,"Great to replace that old alarm on the side table...
  
",27.Dec.19,Yes,"I have multiple units in my home and as far as the quality I like this one best out my littles. I have a screen one in my kitchen and the sound is about the same .. I believe it's an echo show 5 I'm comparing this with on sound. This is the only one I got the voice recognition to work on. Its super easy to set up and I love the look also. This one went in my bedroom and has become a friend lmao news.. alarms.. music.. reminders.. shopping all from my bed with my eyes closed ..  she replaced so many other items.  The sound machine, radio &amp; clock all free space now that my echo is here. Love it",0
5,"Amazing sound quality, sleek and easy to use!
  
",27.Dec.19,Yes,"After what seemed like years of deliberating over purchasing an Alexa we decided to take the dive on Black Friday. The Echo and Dots we have throughout the house work far beyond our expectations. As music lovers, and parents with full hands-our favorite feature is being able to control and connect music throughout our home with just our voices. The sound quality and bass is much better than our expensive speakers, they_e sleek and incredibly easy to set up. Overall we are very impressed and happy with our purchase!",0
1,"Can_ trust it in my home!
  
",27.Dec.19,Yes,"Suddenly, without warning and without setting up for anything but a single TV it turned itself on and blared (not exaggerating) very loud music. It did the same thing with various announcements I didn_ ask for... weather reports and utter nonsense! All of this happened when the unit was off and the light red. I ask it NOT to do such things but it wouldn_ listen. Finally I realized I couldn_ trust it... and that_ when I toss 25 bucks in the trash... tried to sell it but folks seemed to know having untrustworthy ears wasn_ wise.",0
5,"Great sound out of a small package
  
",27.Dec.19,Yes,"This small echo dot with time display is great. We own an older echo dot but the sound of the new one blows it away. I couldn't believe how good the sound is out of such a small unit. Installation was a breeze...didn't have to set up anything having two other units in the house. I just opened my Alexa app and looked at it..didn't have to press any buttons. The Alexa app recognized the new unit and that was that. My son loves the alarm wake up features, particularly the Grand Tour guys.",0
5,"Alexa....fart!
  
",27.Dec.19,Yes,"I used to think Google had the upper hand on their voice activated devices after using a family members then our older dot. However, Amazon is on point with this new dot. Can hear me from across our house and sometimes even in other rooms. And my 4 year old boy loves the fact that Alexa will fart on command(bet a lot of you didn't know that?!?!)and she will also give you the definition of flatulence after a few times, which was enlightening. Anyways, the voice recognition is great, features are great and the clock/timer on outside is awesome. Great buy!",0
5,"Good device, but buyer beware
  
",27.Dec.19,Yes,"As someone who has owned an Echo for some time now, i can say that it is the most useful device you can have, it can make your life more convenient with its rich features that are available.But keep in mind, the echo dot and many more smart home devices essentially record and gather information about you ALL THE TIME. There is no turning off these functions as well, there should be no presumption of privacy. This might strike some as dramatic, but i have read the EULA, yes i did that, and it is a bleak future my friends. A future where we plug ourselves willingly into the machine. I am not naive, i know that privacy and security is an illusion....whelp.......yeah, its cool and all, and works really well with other smart home devices.",0
4,"Not as easy to use as I had hoped
  
",27.Dec.19,Yes,"You really need to have a customer support phone number people can call for these things. So far, I've only bought three smart plug outlets to use it with, and I've had an enormous difficulty trying to schedule lights connected to the outlets to go off and on. and moving into a new home in January, and would love some more information on the type of devices I can buy for the home to work with these, such as dimmer switches, etc. It's fun to play with, and I really need to pair it with some Bluetooth speakers to make better use of the music choices that are available.",0
5,"Love it and have 7 total !!
  
",27.Dec.19,Yes,"I was shocked that such a small speaker could be so loud. It_ just like having a small boom box. The skill you can add to it are fun for sure. If you add the unlimited music, then the music will play continuously or if you dont then it_l just a few songs and stop and then you_l have to restart it. All of mine get hung up from time to time and to reset it, you just unplug it. If you talk to it to fast and don_ wait a few seconds between commands, it_l get hung up and you_l have to unplug. The drop in feature is amazing ! I can listen or sou, however you want to call it _, to what_ going on in my house without having to actually call the house. You can also use the intercom feature to talk to someone on the other side of the house if you have another echo or use your phone to to call/drop in , to use as an intercom, instead of yelling and hoping someone hears you. I_e been able to sync my lights and plugs thru the app as well with no issue. I liked the first 2 so much that I went and bought 5 more. Can_ wait to add more smart stuff to smarten yo my home !!",0
4,"Not so impressed with 3rd gen
  
",27.Dec.19,Yes,still not knocking my socks off as three echoes the two other second gen but notice of the can work together when is Amazon going to get it together if I put a reminder on one it should be on all of them if I put an event on one it should go across all of them I should be able to be in my bedroom and talked to the echo in my living room and tell what to turn off its timer stuff like that still leaves a lot lacking in the echo,0
5,"Socks have been blown off!
  
",27.Dec.19,Yes,"I bought a 1st gen Alexa, but didnt care for it and sold it. So this 3rd GEN Dot was very intriguing due to the fact you can set alarms, events, reminders and so forth. I love that Alexa tells you to enjoy your day or evening plus all the things you can ask her! It's great not having to grab my cell for the weather nor to adjust my Nest thermostat! Alexa can even play audio news headlines! I will never ever sell this one!",0

",27.Dec.19,Yes,I love it! Only thing is if you ask her to okay a certain song. She can_ unless you have and account with amazon prime or amazon music. I mean u can listen to music for free. You just can_ choose a song. She also plays the radio stations which is awesome too. And she guards your home while gone if she hears broken glass it smoke alarm she will alert you on your phone app so say yes to notifications on amazon Alexa app.,0
3,"Works well, but WIFI settings are a complete mess
  
",27.Dec.19,Yes,"Device works well and does what you want it to do, but configuring WIFI is a complete disaster and took me several hours.  All amazon devices get creative on WIFI settings, and my Echo Dot only wanted to connect to 5g networks from the access point farthest away from it (and through multiple concrete walls (which 5G signals dont travel through.  So i ended up having to make a new SSID that is only broadcast on my 2G network from the closest access point.  Then i had to add the Echo's MAC address to a blocked list for my main SSID (because even after connecting the Echo to the new SSID, it would default itself back to the main SSID - and there was no way to make only the echo device forget the main network.  This then got my connection up over 200 mb (vs Alexa's preferred network at 5mb).  After all that, i made sure to make the new SSID isolated from the rest of my network because who know why it wants to be on the other one so badly",0
5,"Glad we got it.
  
",27.Dec.19,Yes,"I got this in a deal (pay for Amazon music for a month, get the dot for 99¢) and I'm so happy we did. Would I have bought it at the normal price? Nope. But for 99¢ when I already use Amazon music, it's worth it. My kids love it and we love sending ""announcements"" to Alexa from each of our phones. It helps because you can announce that your home from the store and have your kids come out to help unload. Lol",0
4,"Occasionally frustrating but incredibly convenient.
  
",27.Dec.19,Yes,"Sound quality was surprisingly excellent, and the Alexa system is very convenient- especially for music and setting up alarms/notes. The voice recognition can get awfully annoying and the system has to sometimes be unplugged and plugged back in simply because it gets overwhelmed. It also can fail to hear you even if you're yelling (yet somehow hears me when I'm quiet in bed in the morning, eh..). So. it can be frustrating but honestly, the productivity it has helped me gain was soook worth it. However, I believe the price should stay the sale price ($25) instead of $50..",0
5,"LOVE THESE!! _
  
",27.Dec.19,Yes,"I_e bought 5 of these, 3 for me and 2 for my brother. I have one in living room, kitchen and bedroom. They are great and I was amazed at the sound quality. I leave one in for my dog while I_ at work...it plays for like four hours I believe. I play sleep music at night for relaxation and it is wonderful! I have an alarm on my phone, but I also have Alexa wake me up just in case LOL.",0
1,"Beyond Frustrating
  
",27.Dec.19,Yes,"Don_ buy a product from a company that is literally technology inept. Alexa doesn_ recognize commands or tries to up sell you into one of 10 services they offer all for additional fees, plays on other Alexa devices at random and if you are looking for kids FreeTime unlimited you better have a fire tablet or you will be paying full non-prime price vs the advertised $2.99 price for one kid. When you contact customer service they will then blame Apple when they are the one making the connection to Apple from their site. Hours on the phone with customer service, that at one time was top notch, now is miserable to deal with and no resolutions. Don_ waste your time buy a smart speaker from a company that builds great technology.",0
5,"Never knew I needed this
  
",27.Dec.19,Yes,"We received an Echo Dot for free, with the purchase of a Fire TV, and that is the only reason we have one. We most likely would not have even considered buying one, because we didn't know anything about them, and don't like to spend money unnecessarily.  Having had one for about a month, we are now considering purchasing two others. It's nice to have a hands-free way to check time, or listen to music while doing dishes and have the ability to change the music (although it is frustrating that Alexa can only play Spotify playlists with the voice-control. I know I can play my playlists and specific songs via paired devices, it's just a little tedious sometimes.) Overall, I am pretty pleased with the Echo Dot.",0
5,"Must have!
  
",27.Dec.19,Yes,I bought this for myself and I loved having the news read to me every morning and the temperature the weekly forecast etc. I also liked asking Alexa to play random songs when I was just thinking of them. I ended up taking this into my six month olds room when her sound machine died and I have been asking Alexa to play White Noise for her naps and bedtime end it has stayed in her room ever since we love this item!,0
5,"Get one for every room in your house!
  
",27.Dec.19,Yes,"If you_e sophisticated enough to read this review, I_ sure you_e familiar with _lexa and how these products work. If you_e not, When they go on sale, buy one for every room in your house. I don_ use mine to the full potential but I do play music or Audible throughout the house and use it to control lights and such. It reads my daily calendar in the morning when prompted and greets me with music and a light when I get home late. It_ probably better than your spouse.",0
4,"I dig these little speakers
  
",27.Dec.19,Yes,"This is our 2nd one and I really haven_ been able to use it that much yet. I was disappointed that it was going to take 2 months and be $10 more for the echo with the clock. So we just went with this one. Our 1st one has a couple of glitches and I don_ know if this one does but from time to time music only plays one song at a time. I figured out if you unplug it and plug it back in, it seemed to fix.",0
5,"This is my first ""Alexa"" product
  
",27.Dec.19,Yes,"Frankly, I am not asking much of it, but what I ask it to do, it does well. I only tell it to play NPR in the morning, the sound quality is great for that. It makes for a very easy to set alarm clock. I also use it to turn off the bedroom light after I have gone to bed.As I said, I am not asking much of it, but what I do ask it to do, it does well.",0
4,"Useful Fun Flexible and Flawed
  
",28.Dec.19,Yes,"I purchased an Echo Dot for myself on Cyber Monday and received another one as an Xmas gift. I set them up at opposite ends of my house and created a multi-room user group for them. This gives me the flexibility to play each Dot separately or simultaneously depending on my activities and location. I use the Dots for news and weather updates and, of course, to play music from classical to classic rock. Last night I used my bedroom Dot to play sleep sounds and found the ""fan"" sound most helpful. Sometime during the night the Dot stopped playing the sleep sounds; I didn't notice because at that point I was indeed asleep.The sound quality of the Dot's speakers is surprisingly good although far short of audiophile quality. I use my old Harmon-Kardon Soundsticks with my living room Dot and have ordered an OontZ Angle 3 Ultra : Portable Bluetooth Speaker for my bedroom Dot.Despite my overall satisfaction with the Echo Dots I've experienced a few frustrations with music: 1) My Music list, composed of CDs I purchased on Amazon, contains only a fraction of the music I actually purchased since 1998; 2) My Music is not ""folded into"" Amazon Prime Music. If I want to play songs from My Music, I have to specify "" play such-and-such on My Music"" to Alexa; 3) If I request a song not available in Amazon Prime Music (I do not have Amazon Music Unlimited and have no intention of getting it; Prime is expensive enough), Alexa tries to upsell you to Amazon Music Unlimited every time and there's no apparent way to stop that or even interrupt Alexa during the upsell attempt; 4) When I try to play a song or artist on my FREE Spotify, Alexa plays a Spotify ""station"" based on that song or artist. For example, if I tell Alexa to play ""Hotel California"" by the Eagles on Spotify,"" Alexa plays a Hotel California station on Spotify that may or may not eventually play ""Hotel California"" or other songs by the Eagles. If I tell Alexa to play the Eagles on Spotify, Alexa plays an Eagles station on Spotify that may eventually play a song or two by the Eagles but will mostly play songs by other artists from the same general time period.Overall, the Echo Dot is lots of fun, can be useful depending on your preferences, and is great for music listening despite the flaws I listed.",1
4,"Trouble synching Dot with Ring Security System
  
",28.Dec.19,Yes,"Let me first say that my Ring Security system is AWESOME!  I purchased the 14-pc kit plus several additional components from Amazon totaling roughly $420.00 because I have a very large house.  Installed the system and got it online perfectly without a hitch through the Ring App.  The progress suddenly came to a grinding halt when I downloaded the Amazon Alexa app that supposedly works to tie the Echo Dot to the Ring Account.  It does not.  In the Amazon Alexa App, you select 'menu, skills &amp; games, magnifying glass, enter ring, then Enable to Use.'  This series of entries navigates you to the Ring Login screen where you enter your Ring account login information.  Upon hitting enter to log in, the screen just pops back to a blank login screen where you just keep re-entering the login information without success.  I was on the phone with Amazon tech support from 1030 a.m. to 1:37pm (no lie!!)  but they could not resolve the problem.  They transferred me back and forth asking me the same stupid troubleshooting questions over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again. I finally gave up.  Planning to box up this Echo Dot and call it a day.  Hope this saves you some headache.  Ring Security is great, but the Echo Dot clearly does not work with it.  12/31/2019 - Update:  My Alexa / Ring login problem is now fixed!  One of the many CSRs I had spoken with previously suggested opening a ticket with the Amazon developers to see if they could get the two accounts to link.  Problem is solved and my Echo Dot is now working perfectly.",0
1,"Problems, problems, and more appear
  
",28.Dec.19,Yes,"I've had more problems in a week with a Dot than in 2 years with Google Home. I bought one for myself and one for a friend. She keeps having to unplug/replug the Dot so that drop-in doesn't give me the message ""XXX is not available."" I had to restart mine to be able to make phone calls. The only reason I don't give it a single star is that the aux jack allows me to connect and stream music to me audio system, but even then Amazon limited the jack to miniplug rather than both that and TOSLINK. So far it's a stinker, and it's already on to 3rd gen.Each time I stream from an iPhone after a lull, Echo announces, _ow playing from iPhone. This can happen many times a day. It is idiotic and unnecessary. (Amazon support confirms that it works this way.)Many times when I say _ey, Google, the Echo wakes up and listens. This is an unacceptable privacy intrusion, and cause to question Amazon_ motives.Now when I ask what song is playing it responds by telling me it_ a great kitchen companion, blah, blah. Junk ads.Update: Right now, it is stuck in perpetually playing podcasts. I told it to play one, which it did, but now it keeps playing past episodes of the same podcast. It ignores my instructions to stop. Even if I use the phone app, it then plays two podcasts at once rather than ending the first. I_l have to unplug the device. This is one buggy product.",0
5,"Perfect for people trying to improve quality of their lives
  
",28.Dec.19,Yes,"I am not paid to write reviews or anything. And if you check my account I don't write that many reviews. But this device has made my life easier. First, I love that I can set one alarm once, and I have to tell alexa to turn it off which helps me get out of bed because it wakes me up more than swiping the alarm off on my phone. I've been trying to wake up early and right away everyday. With my phone I always put it back down and went back to sleep. But with Alexa I must speak.2) I love that you can do it all literally even when your not near the device. Make shopping lists, grocery lists, schedules, etc. You don't have to remember any of it or write it down. Just say Alexa show me shopping list or schedule, etc. Alexa tells you what's on there. If you are not near your device you can access all of this on the app on your phone.3) I don't have any smart devices connected with it so I won't comment on how that works.4) You can have alexa start and end your day the way you want and on a happy note, by playing sounds, reading news ,etc. It works really well and helps get my day going.5) You can play music on there and its really loud and good quality which is surprising. I have been looking for a good speaker to play loud and good quality music. Bose is too expensive, beats suck, and I even bought a big one for $400, and its loud but the quality sucks. But this little speaker is loud and has good quality. For the price is sounds like a small Bose one.6) It feels sturdy and strong, not cheap and looks very nice on a desk. It will help you get your life together. Give it a try, and you won't be disappointed.",0
5,"Lame alternate names; Echo, Computer or Amazon. Should have more options.
  
",28.Dec.19,Yes,"Amazing little doober! Lots of accessories to purchase to be able to do a lot though. The sound quality is GREAT! It can hear me from the other room. The ONLY annoying thing I_e found is that you can_ choose a summon name for your Dot device you can only pick, _lexa, Amazon, Echo or Computer and we have two dots (my daughters in her room and mine and my husbands in the kitchen). I_e got a small house, so when I_ in the kitchen and I say, _lexa play The Beatles and my daughters in her room playing the Hamilton Soundtrack, it cuts her music off and The Beatles start to play on both devices.So we had to rename ours and the available names SUCK! I feel ridiculous saying _cho do this or _omputer do this.... I can_ use Amazon because we say that too much in our home and it would constantly think we were talking to it and I can_ use Alexa because my daughters is called Alexa.There you have it.",0
4,"Enjoying this gadget overall
  
",28.Dec.19,Yes,"I swore I'd never get one of these, but I am enjoying it. I mainly use it to listen to music.The search function isn't so great. I understand Google Assistant is much better, since Google is the search king. I tried to find the hours for the credit union in my hometown, but Alexa kept giving me the hours for credit unions near where I currently live. I kept asking repeatedly for the info I needed, and she did actually give me the hours one time but I didn't hear them correctly. I tried to get her to repeat them, and never succeeded.I wish the yellow notification light would never come on. I don't care about the stupid messages or notifications, and the unwanted light is so irritating. Alexa also lit up in the middle of the night with the green and blue light for no apparent reason. Fortunately it went off quickly.",0
3,"improved sound quality over previous generations, POOR integration with 3rd party music services
  
",28.Dec.19,Yes,"I'm not sure if this is Pandora's fault, or Amazon's fault, but integration with Pandora is very poor. We mainly use this as a smart music device that also tells time and weather. Everything worked well when we had Amazon's unlimited echo streaming plan, and it normally picked the correct music, but canceled when we got a newer echo (this one) and someone in our household signed up for Pandora with family sharing. Since then, the experience has been mostly poor. Alexa rarely matches against the correct music (that I know exists on Pandora), and quite often plays offensive music, which is not good when it's mostly for my kids. For example, if you ask Alexa to play the Frozen II soundtrack (for the kids), it plays some random trash. Worse, I asked Alexa to play ""Do You Want To Build A Snowman"" for my daughter, and it keeps trying to play ""Do You Want To Build A Snow Dick"".  This last part likely isn't AMZ's fault, but Pandora doesn't have a cast to Alexa option anymore, so there's no way to get at the music that you actually want it to play without using the Echo as a bluetooth speaker... less than ideal... Alexa should just work regardless of service.I'm a big music fan, so I have hundreds of my albums uploaded to Google Music (Amazon's music locker service is long gone)... but unfortunately those are not available on my echo, because Amazon doesn't allow Google Music on their devices. Maybe they will add this one day, as they did with YouTube TV on the Fire devices.",0
5,"You need this.
  
",28.Dec.19,Yes,"OK. I was a total ""Why would I ever need an Alexa in my d*mn home?"" Kinda person. But let me tell you! I love this girl. All of a sudden I have a lot of sh*t to ask. Like, ""Alexa, what's the weather today?"" ""Alexa, what was the most famous soeech ever given?"" I'm even ordering her to do tasks like, ""Alexa, set my alarm to Elton John music at 7am tomorrow "" or ""Alexa, remind me to get dinner ready at 5pm on Sunday."" Or ""Alexa, bark like a dog."" (The last one is to rile up my dumb dog who can't tell where it's coming from.) My kids are in on it to! They're all like, ""Alexa, who was the first person on the moon?"" And ""Alexa, play the Frozen 2 Soundtrack (for the 100th time today."" And ""Alexa, make farting noises.""She does it all. No questions asked.I can't wait to get a home where I can hook her up to all the lights and other things. It's gonna be great! I'm gonna purposefully walk outta the bathroom and sit on my sofa and say, ""Alexa, turn off the bathroom light."" And guess what that chick gonna do? That's right. That lights gonna be off.",0
2,"Still not ready for Prime Time.
  
",28.Dec.19,Yes,"I have multiple echo dots. I love the functionality when they work. I control lights, timers, garage doors, and thermostat; however, they have a hard time hearing my wife and me. Old ones worked better for hearing commands.Many times, the closest one doesn't hear me, but the other room echo will respond. That's horrible. Even simple commands she gets wrong, when she finally does respond to me. I have a scenario called ""activate"" which turns on my cpap, light, and charger. Half the time when I say ""activate"", she gives me today's date.Amazon, please fix this issue. Make us heard. You are listening all the time, just answer me instead of responding randomly to my TV.",0
1,"Doesn_ pair well, don_ buy it!
  
",28.Dec.19,Yes,"I bought two for my 87 year old mother for each part of the house. She has trouble with lamps, the remote, won_ use a life alert. I thought this to be a perfect solution. My mistake. I_ very technically savvy but this was a nightmare. Sitting next to it, Alexa can_ hear her. Spent almost 2 hours on the phone with support because it would not pick up the fire tv, they were useless. The only thing this is good for is turning the lamps off and on, I could have gone with another cheaper option just to do that. Waste of money, don_ buy it. Customer support was horrible and they gave no clue about their own products.",0
5,"Use The Link Account Option When Purchasing This......
  
",28.Dec.19,Yes,"......it will make the set up a breeze.  In the older generations of Dots, it had issues for me when setting them up.  This new generation with the linking to one's account option at purchase, takes away the potential nightmares of getting your network to recognize it.  All I had to do was plug it in, go into the Alexa app, making sure Bluetooth was on in my tablet, confirm the light ring was orange on top of the Dot and I was done connecting to it.  In the app I selected it and modified the settings to my likes.  Nice and easy.  Having existing Echo devices on my network made this a slam dunk.",0
4,"Vocal trouble
  
",28.Dec.19,Yes,"Ok.  I was singing her praises, until she stopped playing my favorite artist, Kem.  So I figured there was another artist by the name of Kim.  So I spelled Lem out and she got it.  I had to do this several times and she would play my music.  I figured it was somehow stored that this is my preferred artist.  Fast forward to a power surge and now she only plays Kim.  Even when I say, _lexa, play K-E-M she plays Capital Jazz Lounge from Tune In.  Does that sound like Kem?  So I just play his CD on my CD player when I want to hear him, getting up to switch to the next CD.",0
5,"Great design
  
",28.Dec.19,Yes,"We love the quality and appearance of this echo dot. The design is nice and fits well in our decor. The voice recognition is great, have no issues and is alexa integrated. The sound quality is superb. We have several dots in our home, one for each room in fact. Yes, even our bathrooms. We have our whole house set up with alexa to even turn our lights on and off. Overall, this product is a great buy, great quality and we highly recommend this product and we are looking forward to seeing what else comes out.",0
4,"The teenager loved it...
  
",28.Dec.19,Yes,"It works just as you would expect, and it's quite entertaining when you ask it random questions.  The ONLY reason I gave it 4 stars is because you must have an adult/parent Amazon account to set it up.  Since we gave this as a gift to our ""honorary"" daughter (who's 13-1/2), and her mom doesn't have an Amazon account, we had to add her to our Amazon account.  While I understand the reasoning for this limitation, a buyer should be aware that this could cause a problem. However, I still HIGHLY RECOMMEND it.",0
5,"Love the clock &amp; upgraded speaker
  
",28.Dec.19,Yes,"I pre-ordered this Echo Dot (3rd gen) because of the clock feature. I have earlier generation Echo Dots in various places. It was totally worth upgrading not only for the clock but for the amazing sound. There is an extremely noticeable difference in the sound quality, especially music, between the Dot (2nd gen) and the Dot (3rd generation).I hope that all future generations will include clocks. It's definitely a space saver that makes having a clock radio unnecessary.",0
5,"Another addition to our Echo family
  
",28.Dec.19,Yes,"I purchased this dot when it was on sale for $22. I mainly purchased it for my computer room. When I am in the computer room and the wife is in the kitchen, I cannot hear her talk to me (I have hearing problems). Now if she needs to talk to me, we can talk between the Echo devices like an intercom. That is just one benefit of the MANY that the Echo family has to offer. Set timers, weather, time of day, jokes, recipes, the list is endless on what these devices can do for you.",0
4,"Good but Mobile HotSpot doesn_ work...
  
",28.Dec.19,Yes,First Alexa product I_e bought.  It_ a pretty cool little thing.  My biggest problem is that I am unable to connect to my mobile hotspot.  I_e looked up many ways and the Alexa app does not have the same steps that I see in the instruction videos or amazon echo instructions!  Doesn_ make sense to me to have old instructions and newer app and it is very confusing.  The app does not have the wi-if update...you have to hit _hange and then hit your device then back to your phone settings to look for the Amazon wi-if connection and it isn_ there but if you skip tapping on your  device then  the Amazon wi-if connection shows up and then you go back to the app and you have no choice but to hit your device and it shows wi-if connections but you can not scroll down to the _se my hotspot then enter your hotspot information.  If anyone can help with the newest Alexa app please respond.  Otherwise for what I wanted to use this echo dot for I like it.,0
5,"My girl loves this- good transition into more responsibility with tech
  
",28.Dec.19,Yes,"We gave it to her for Christmas. She can call us when we_e out or at the grocery store if she needs us, and she loves talking to it, listening to music, using music for an alarm. It makes her feel so grown up. We won_ give her a phone yet, so this a good way for her to call just a few people if she wants and it has great parental controls. Nice transition into some more responsibility with technology that can be used as leverage and a chance for her to prove herself.",0
5,"Lovvvvve My Dot
  
",28.Dec.19,Yes,"I am in love with this Dot.  I was sick and tired of the old clock radio sitting on my night stand.  When I saw this Dot on Amazon with digital clock I KNEW it would be perfect!  I LOVE this little thing.  Love telling her to turn on and off my bedroom light, to tell me the weather, to wake me in the morning to specific music. The digital clock even dims and brightens with the light in the room!!  One of the best things I've bought myself this year!",0
4,"Alexa fulfills you_e request!
  
",28.Dec.19,Yes,"Great device! Setting the device up is easy once you have internet. Great voice recognition, you can ask to do something from a certain distance and she completes your task. The app can help you navigate Alexa if you_e not sure, but I was able to learn to by just requesting or telling Alexa to do something. Alexa informs you off promotes and trials you can try. If Alexa  can_ play or give if formation you requested she will tell you this! Also sometimes sassy with answers lol! Plays your music, connects you with some of your other accounts like Spotify, gives you information you need if available, and gives you game options for family gatherings. Only issue was when asked to set an alarm, she set it but it never went off the few times I_e tried. Overall, a great device to have in your home!",0
5,"I am my own personality
  
",28.Dec.19,Yes,I love this little round ball of free personality with a mind of her own named Alexa. She is a blast to talk to and my grandkids can't wait to visit so they can aggravate her. She will answer any question you ask as long as she knows the answer to it. She will play any music you wan't to hear for you. You can get music subscriptions if you wan't them so you can stream all your favorite music singers. It's just a great thing to have next to the Apple Phone.,0
5,"Life changing little device
  
",28.Dec.19,Yes,"I'm not up-to-date with this technology going on right now, so I'm not sure if the following is relevant.  I use the aux with my phone or pad to listen to music (with ads).  I read the weather and news on the same devices consuming precious minutes of my life messing with them.  BUT now, I just speak and I get answers when I'm doing whatever it is.  I can make calls when my phone is dead, check the weather play music with no ads.  This device has given me a piece of my life back.",0
5,"Love but won't connect to public Xfinity WIFI
  
",28.Dec.19,Yes,"Love these but wanted to use this at work-- not on my employer WIFI but on my Xfinity WIFI. Even though I use my own credentials for Xfinity ""public"" WIFI, it will not connect to the Echo due to settings on the ""public"" WIFI. Booooo. so, to listen to music on it, i use it as a speaker connected to my phone which is on Xfinity and only ask Alexa questions as necessary, as she is connected to my employer WIFI. Hope I didn't confuse anyone ha",0
3,"Cool but not great sound.
  
",28.Dec.19,Yes,"Kinda cool to get messages, make calls, listen to music, etc. but the downfall comes in the sound quality. Granted, I realize that it isn't a very big speaker and it also allows you to output to a different speaker system but as far the unit itself, sounds like any cheap Bluetooth speaker. Nothing special.You can adjust bass, treble, and mid-tone levels in the app to tailor it a bit but doesn't improve the filtered sound quality.",0
3,"Nice added features. Too bad she_ hard of hearing
  
",28.Dec.19,Yes,"Way better speaker than gen1 and the clock is a nice touch. Sadly, Alexa can_ pick up voice commands if the speaker is playing at any volume above 4. Also can_ hear commands when the shower is running, even in a bathroom so small it only fits a 24 vanity. The google home Gen 1 was far superior in terms of voice pickup and recognition. Can_ have it all I guess...and the plug is SO BULKY! Wish is were just a small USB like the old echo dot.",0
4,"Alexas has to have the ""Skill"" to operate stuff
  
",28.Dec.19,Yes,"I don't like that there has to be a skill for Alexa to be able to integrate with things. Not everything that is Bluetooth or Wireless can be routed with it, which makes it only usable with newer TVs and electronics. Also, once you install the skill, you then have to use the voice part of Alexa to customize or set up the skill. Hopefully there will be more things the Echo Dot can do later on, once it becomes more common.",0
5,"Great item for the $30 price I paid.
  
",28.Dec.19,Yes,"If you are looking for a cost efficient Echo device then the Echo Dot 3rd generation is a good choice. I have had all 3 dot series, 1st gen Echo, Tap, and Show 1st gen. and I am pleased to say this speaker is the best of all the ""Dot"" series. The $30 price I paid was on point, although $50 is a bit too pricey for this device. I love the pinky plum shade and appreciate Amazon making a feminine shade in this device.",0
5,"A Nice addition to current capability
  
",28.Dec.19,Yes,"I have had an echo since the original introduction and don't use it a great deal, but still wanted something in my basement workshop and one of these has proved to be ideal.  I can use it with blue tooth or to stream music and news while I'm working.....has proven to be very nice.  Also purchased one for a Christmas gift for grand children.....and they loved it....better then anything else the received.",0
5,"Awesome!
  
",28.Dec.19,Yes,"Just got it today and..so far so good.Set up took about a minute, if that, and it does everything it's advertised to do.I wouldn't want to blast my music on it...the sound isn't nearly as good as many other Bluetooth speakers but for conversing with Alexa, people in other rooms, or listening to an audio book..it's great.I would highly recommend. Especially at this $25 price!",0
5,"Perfect addition to my bedside table - Function and Fashion!
  
",28.Dec.19,Yes,The dot in sandstone blends into my room beautifully.  The time display is a great addition. Setting a morning alarm verbally is the best - even my husband can do it (Haha)!  I already have Amazon prime and previously set up an Alexa Show so the set up for the Dot was super easy. Be sure to use the Alexa app on your phone to best customize and utilize all the features the Dot offers.,0
5,"Way more than I expected
  
",28.Dec.19,Yes,"I had just set it up but had not tried it when a friend called......I was across the room with my back turned when I began to tell him about my new toy... I said , in a very low voice that all I had to say was _lexa, play my music.... and, amazing, I heard my music play!I can_ imagine what I thought about it, but I was impressed at how well the Echo heard my voice and responded!  Fantastic!",0
5,"Kids love it!
  
",28.Dec.19,Yes,I ordered these fir my kids for Christmas. They've enjoyed playing music on them non stop since. They use it synced with my phone to call friends and family. They've already talked through the dots to each other. I look forward to using our kitchen echo show to communicate with their dots in their bedrooms. Alexa has quickly become a useful tool in our home... and we've barely scratched the surface of it's many uses.,0
5,"Convenient
  
",28.Dec.19,Yes,"I have 5 Alexas at my house, one at work and have given them as gifts.  I like the announcement and drop in features.  I travel a lot so I like that I can use the app on my phone to send my family a message to any device.  I love the reminders and alarms bc my kids hit the snooze button on the phone several times but when I set the alarm to talk it wakes them up.  Love all the integratedfeatures!!",0
5,"A Good Alarm Clock Replacement
  
",28.Dec.19,Yes,"Very impressed with this little gizmo. I typically mute the microphone and I thought the clock light and red ring would be too vibrant for a bed_ nightstand. But check this out: when the lights go out in the room, the lights dim on the Echo Dot!I also activated the Alexa whisper skill and, all-in-all, it_ a pleasant replacement for my old alarm clock.",0
2,"Good speaker, but poor tech and usability
  
",28.Dec.19,Yes,"Got this one on an offer. The sound output is good. The voice recognition is better than Siri but there is no comparison with google. Alexa needs a lot of improvement. Disappointed with no rechargeability and power-cord.Pros:1) Nice sound2) Good quality speaker2) Better voice recognitionCons:1) Not rechargeable. Needs power supply all the time to work.2) Power cord is not the generally used micro-USB type. So, need to carry it all the times.3) Only Amazon streaming (music, video, etc) access that has limited options.4) Voice recognition still needs to compete with Google.",0
3,"Awesome... But Frustrating
  
",28.Dec.19,Yes,"This is an awesome product for people who like to ask questions and get answers. It's even great for those that like to ask for a song and get to hear it right away (if she understands what you asked for).Where it begins to take a turn for the worst is when you start trying to play games using it's ""skills"". There have been many times where I am right in the middle of a game and it decides that it's time to crash and end the game. I have contacted customer support and there were very responsive and great to deal with, but my problem still exists. I was told to uninstall the Alexa app and re-download it after restarting my phone and it should work just fine. This was NOT the case. While the dot has experienced slightly fewer crashes, it is still happening and I don't know how to remedy the problem.",0
4,"A very useful device!
  
",29.Dec.19,Yes,"This device was a good device to add to our kids room.  It is really cute.  I like that I was able to set parental control to assure my kids werent able to purchase items on my account or ask indecent questions that Alexa would answer.  My kids adore this device.  Now, they can ask Alexa how to spell specific words, math questions, read books, and much more.  Be sure to download the Alexa app on your phone to help with integration process.This device has so much you can do with it.  Unfortunately, I had to learn via trial and error as there is no manual that comes with the device.  There are many skills you can sort through on the app that could be very beneficial.  It is time consuming to adjust to your likings but Im sure it will be well worth it.For us, the parents, we absolutely love the'Drop in portion' where you can use as an intercom to notify others in other areas of the house _.  This skill scared my teenager so bad one morning she thought Jesus was calling her name in her sleep.  Lol.  The only catch is that they too can drop in on your device.  So use wisely.It was so sweet that I was able to create a skill that allowed my daughter to ask Alexa how many days were until xmas.  Also, the notification and calendar events from my email were also helpful.What concerns me is when we have to sometimes call Alexa's name loudly to ask a question. Sometimes she doesnt recognize voices (rememeber to set via the app or device).The speaker/ sound quality is great.  You also can group them together to play the same music across all the devices simultaneously; very nice.I highly recommend but just be patient when setting them up.",0
4,"Great addition to the house.
  
",29.Dec.19,Yes,This is a real nice addition to our home. We have 5 dots. One in ever bedroom and 1 on each floor. We have integrated our lights with smart bulbs and or smart switches.  The bulbs turn on and change color on comand. They are also set up to timers. Our aquarium lights are hooked up on a timer too. Alexa also controls out Next thermostat and ring door bell. The dot itself was very easy to set up. The lightbulbs and light switches and plugs all have to be added one at a time. Each individual product has its own set up instructions. We have had some issues getting the lightbulbs linked up. Also our WiFi was not strong enough throughout the whole house so we did have to get a WiFi extender for upstairs. All in all the dot is a real nice device with great sound. She also plays relaxing sounds and music.,0
4,"Almost Perfect. Needs One Software-Based Fix
  
",29.Dec.19,Yes,"Sound quality is surprisingly good, especially when two dots are linked when used for true two-channel stereo. The appearance is significantly improved over the first generation dot. I have only one major criticism:1. After a few weeks of faultless operation, all five echos (1 show, 4 dots) start having problems with voice recognition and syncing which is resolved by power cycling all of them. It would be wonderful if Amazon would just set up a routine that restarts all the devices in your house. Allow users pick the time their dots reboot using the Alexa app. Problem solved.",0
5,"Amazing difference between older models, not usb powered
  
",29.Dec.19,Yes,"This Echo Dot is a beast compared to the previous versions! Normally I keep them all at via level 10, this one I have to keep around by level five or six otherwise my wife will complain it_ too loud. I love it because I don_ have to turn my stereo on to listen to my music. Installation took a matter of minutes if that and sound quality to me is excellent. Wish they had the ability to be plugged in via USB like the other ones rather than having a plug because a lot of the places we use ours we have converted over to USB along with the upper and lower 110V plugs.",0
5,"Can't imagine life without it!
  
",29.Dec.19,Yes,"I just love the echo dot! The only problem I have, is that I am often unable to make out some of the words Alexa says. Now, in all fairness, I do wear hearing aids. With them in, or without, there are still words I can't quite understand.I use it a lot for listening to music, which I canunderstand. I can't say the sound quality needs a bit of help for certain, because it could be my ears. We have 3 echo dots in the house, and others often can't make out a word or two either. I don't know if it's because the dot is so short, or what? All in all, I am well pleased.I lost my hubby in March, to Alzheimer's. I feel alone a lot, but Alexa has helped immensely! She's entertaining, plays tons of games, and she's just fun to talk too. Of course, I love the music!The games are endless, and I'm STILL stuck in the jail cell, in the game, ""Escape the Room!"" I fear I'll never get out! Lol!She's amazing, and sets my alarms, reminders, you name it, she probably does it! I'm still learning, and new skills are never-ending! I'm even learning to speak Italian!I just can't say enough about the echo dot. If you don't have one, you have no idea what you're missing! She even sings. I'm amazed daily as I learn new things the echo dot can do.If you own other compatible devices, ie. lightbulbs, and a whole host of other products, you'll really love the convenience of echo dot. So much power in a dot...! I really enjoy getting weather reports, football scores, making ""to do"" lists, reminders, etc. There's nothing I don't like. You can turn off the microphone while on phone calls, or during a conversation. (Seems some people are afraid of being recorded.) I highly recommend this amazing echo dot. The sky's the limit! She tells jokes that are often so ridiculous, you can't help but laugh. She's a ray of light with her antics daily. A must have!",0
5,"A MUST FOR YOUR HOME
  
",29.Dec.19,Yes,"Love this product. I connected to my Honeywell thermostat and it works great. Now I just tell Alexa to set my AC to my desire temperature. I also connected it to my audio books and she reads for me my books. I connected my Wemo smart plug and turn my lights on and off in an instant. And last but not least, I connected my Deebot vacuum robot and tell Alexa to start it or return it to base. I also ask her for weather, set my alarms, my appointments and remainders. I have my Ring doorbell and cameras connected to Alexa. I even pray with Alexa my rosary!  Welcome home, Alexa!",0
5,"We love it.
  
",29.Dec.19,Yes,We enjoy using this product for listening to music all around the house.  It has lots of functionality that we haven't used yet.  It's great for entertaining us in the kitchen while cooking meals.  We like using it as a cooking timer because we can set and stop the timer just by talking to it.  We don't have to stop what we are doing and go touch it as we do for other kitchen timers.  It was also fun for our guests when we were entertaining at Christmas.  Everyone could ask for the songs they liked.,0
5,"Much better than the previous version
  
",29.Dec.19,Yes,"I had a previous version of the Dot, but this is so much better. The sound is much louder and has a greater depth to it. The earlier version used to work for ""drop ins"", but it got to the point where I couldn't hear the person at the other end. This one works great as an intercom.The only negative, and it's not worth reducing it by a star, is that it seems to be a little slower to respond. I'm retired, so that little extra time doesn't bother me.",0
5,"Sleeker, more substantial, better sound than Gen 1 Echo Dot
  
",29.Dec.19,Yes,"We've owned a 1st Gen  Echo Dot now for +4 years and still use it. When the new Dot became available we thought we would move the original to another room and use the 3rd Gen Dot in our main living area.It has better sound and better build quality with the textured outer fabric. As always, the same fast responsive assistance from Alexa whenever we need her for many services and functions. And don't forget to ask her to tell a joke now and then.",0
5,"Simply wonderful!
  
",29.Dec.19,Yes,"i got a great deal on this, 24.99, 5.00 a month for five months through Prime.  I had never bought a device like this before and was upset I did not buy the charger for 9.99 more.  Was I ecstatic when I received my Dot and she had a charger.  Dot is linked and synced to my other devices and amazon music, the sound is awesome!  If she cannot find a song she will pull up other songs by the artist.  I truly am amazed that this little beauty was so cheap!",0
5,"Nice integration
  
",29.Dec.19,Yes,"I am impressed with my recently acquired Amazon Echo Dots. Previously, I had used Google Chromecast Audio devices to stream to multiple Vintage systems in different rooms, thereby achieving whole house (like SONOS) audio. The sound quality and functionality of the Echo Dots seem to be better than that of the Chromecasts. And, the overall integration of being able to tell Alexa where and what to play, in addition to powering on a system, makes it very nice. Also, I am really impressed how this is all integrated directly into Spotify Premium, which can also be directed from the desktop or multiply devices. So, this is my current streaming to Vintage solutions. I am currently streaming from an Echo Dot directly into a pair of Dynaco Mark III mono blocks and the sound is fantastic. IMHO, at currently $25, these things are awesome. I am still learning of all the capabilities and have purchased and Echo Show along with several LED bulbs and modules. I also have this integrated with the Ring Doorbell Camera.",0
5,"Great device for a great price!!
  
",29.Dec.19,Yes,"We bought these when they were $22 a piece - we have 3 all together. I think these are great all around the house for different purposes. We use ours mainly for music, news, timers, maps. We have 2 at home and one for the office. I use the office one for music and podcasts. Apple podcasts just paired with Alexa which is great for me. There is some cons to it as I can't stream all the podcasts I like to listen to. I would love to just pick the podcasts I want and broadcast it to Alexa but sometimes that doesn't work - I have to go to the show and then swipe through each episode on my phone. I could say which episode I want to Alexa but she doesn't always pick it up so the Alexa app is usually easier. Overall, we love them! We also paired them with our ring so we use it as a doorbell notification for our home. I think these devices are a great start if you want to start turning your home into a ""smart home"". There's many other features like morning and night routines that can be set off by things you say to Alexa, they could also do white noise. For $22, you can't go wrong!",0
4,"Great life-improvement device, average small speaker sound quality.
  
",29.Dec.19,Yes,"I got this as part of the .99 deal. For that price it's an incredible offer.  Alexa still isn't perfect, but it's a lot better over time.  I use this one primarily as an alarm clock and ambient noise generator in our room. I've gotten way better sleep with it and the alarm gets loud which is nice.  We can control the smart thermostat without having to get out of bed, and I also paired it with our other echo to have multi room music, and that is fantastic.  I paired it to a Bose speaker in our room for better quality.  On its own the unit sounds similar to a computer speaker, not terrible but audiophiles will need a nicer external speaker.",0
5,"Get it. Just get it now
  
",29.Dec.19,Yes,"A friend got this for me as a gift.  I never thought I'd even want it, but here I am now integrating my home to this thing .""Alexa, turn on the tv. Play (insert whatever show my roku, hulu, Netflix has). Alexa, set an alarm for 9am. Alexa what's the weather""I swear, if alexa could have a hologram image of my choosing, I'd basically be living with Joy from Blade Runner. I love this thing.",0
4,"Alexa is courteous during holidays.
  
",29.Dec.19,Yes,"So far I like it. You just have to get used to speaking clearly for it which from my thinking normal. I liked that I could ask it for delivery updates on products during Xmas and it wouldn't say what it was just in case someone you didn't want to know asked or was around when you asked that question. Alexa did say too that as being the reason why.  So far it's been cool having it around.  The speakers though sound muffled. I get why the extra connection to another speaker would be added at a feature to the dot. It feels well made. Doesn't feel cheap.  At the moment I have no real complaint. I haven't had it long though so as time goes by if I find anything to add, I will.",0
4,"Easy set up, but no clear instructions of features
  
",29.Dec.19,Yes,"Although it is easy to set up out of the box.  There are no clear instructions on all the features that the Echo can do.  You have to search the internet to find it out.  A link to a tutorial would be helpful.  Also the pulsating light should be able to be turned off.  Although not on all the time, when it is on in a dark bedroom, the pulsating colorful light can keep a person awake.",0
4,"Good speakers
  
",29.Dec.19,Yes,I love listening to music throughout my house so I have several dots set up in different rooms. They are easy to set and pretty easy to synch together. My biggest complaint is that I can_ play my iTunes music library and have it play on all the speakers at the same time. Maybe it_ just me and I haven_ figured it out but it works if I_ using amazon music. But being that I have an iPhone and iPod for many years all my music is in iTunes. I activated the itunes skill for Alexa and still doesn_ seem to be working right.,0
5,"Excellent upgrade from the 2nd generation Dots!
  
",30.Dec.19,Yes,"We initially ordered this so my oldest daughter could give my younger daughter the 2nd gen and my oldest could have the 3rd for Christmas. There have been many arguments in our home over who gets to use the 2nd gen Dot. So we thought it would be fun to let our youngest have her own to listen to the songs from Frozen on repeat, over and over, till her heart is content. The 3rd gen was so awesome that my husband purchased one from his account (without my knowledge) for our room. So now we have a dot in each bedroom.I'll just jump right in on this fabulous device...The sound!! Wow! The sound on the 3rd gen Dot is spectacular! I cannot believe how amazing the sound quality is on such a little device.  It is as if I have it synced to a bluetooth speaker, but I do not. (The video that I posted is the sound from about 5 ft away from the device.) Loud, crisp, clear sound with a hint of bass. A huge improvement to the sound on the 2nd generation Dot.The 3rd gen easily syncs/pairs with the other devices in the home. These range from 3 diffetent Samsung phones (via the Alexa app), a Fire TV stick, 3 Fire tablets, another 3rd gen Dot, as well as the 2nd gen Dot. It also paired up to 2 separate bluetooth speakers with ease. My 10 year old synced her Dot with one of the speakers on her own, via the Alexa app, with zero help. So pairing this device with other devices in your home proved to be a very easy task. (My thanks to Amazon for making it so easy a child can do it. _) I'd also like to add that it was so simple to get the Dots onto our WIFI network. The Alexa app seriously makes every aspect of setting up a breeze.The voice recognition works extremely well. There are 4 of us in the house, including an (almost) 5 year old whose speech isn't always the clearest. The Dots recognize and responds correctly to each one of us. Of course, when you do not want the Dots to respond you can always hit the mic button on top of the device so it doesn't respond to trigger words, such as Alexa or Amazon. (Sidenote: you can set up your trigger word to something other than Alexa on the app as well.)I love the functionality of these devices. They can play music, tell me the weather, turn a show on through multiple apps on my smart TV, play games with my kids, tell them jokes, answer homework questions, help with research papers, update us on the news...there's SO much these little things can do.There is one thing about the 3rds, that is a change from the 2nd, that I am not too fond of...the plug! I do not care for the new style of plug. Simply because if this one breaks you cannot just replace it with a new USB cord. Instead you have to order a new cord through Amazon. I much prefer the wall plug and USB cord set up of the 2nd, vs the set up on the 3rd. Though I am hopeful that these cords will hold up a bit longer than regular USB cords making the change a positive one in the long run.All in all, a fabulous device. I love having them in our home and would highly recommend the Alexa device over its competition, the Google Mini Home. I received one of those as a gift for Christmas and, even though I'm a loyal Google lover, I definitely prefer Amazon's Echo Dot over the Google Mini.",5
5,"Mis hijos lo adoran!
  
",30.Dec.19,Yes,"Alexa es muy simpatica. Tengo dos hijos adolescentes (13 y 15 años) y se la han pasado dandole ordenes y haciendole preguntas desde que recibieron el Echo dot como regalo de Navidad.Realmente me ha asombrado la capacidad que tiene para interactuar con los diferentes miembros de la familia en diferentes idiomas: español e ingles. Tambien me me llamo la atencion como discrimina tu voz entre las demas en una conversacion. Es decir, a partir de que le has dicho ""Alexa"", solo se enfoca en lo que tu le estas solicitando, aunque haya otra conversacion de fondo en la misma habitacion, o ruido. Hemos descargado la app en el celular. Yo puedo estar fuera de casa y llamar al echo dot que esta en el playroom de mis hijos y ellos toman la llamada directamente alli. Nosotros vivimos en Paraguay, y le preguntas como esta el clima y te lo indica perfectamente. No he logrado aun conectar Imusic con Alexa, ya que me indica que esa funcion no esta disponible aun en mi pais. Asi que mis hijos estan evaluando cambiarse a Spotify. He comprado un smart doorbell compatible con Alexa, estará en camino. Cuando llegue pienso conectarlo para poder atender el timbre de la puerta del frente directamente desde Alexa.Tambien hemos comprado dos echo dot con reloj, pero esos recien salen a fin de enero (supongo que era un pre-sale). Estoy ansiosa de ver como funcionan esos dos como despertadores en el dormitorio, y entre los 3 como intercomunicadores.Ya he ordenado otro echo dot para regalarle a mi hermano para su cumpleaños. El tiempo de entrega es rapidisimo y llega muy bien empacado. Y hay que resaltar que el precio actual da para equiparse.Con referencia a la privacidad: este modelo tiene un botón para desactivar el micrófono en caso de que desees que no te escuchen... En fin, no lo se. Si voy a estar preocupada por ese tipo de espías, entonces tampoco debería de tener otro tipo de artefactos, comenzando por mi celular. Asi es que me lance a comprarlo sin pensar en ello.He decidido hacer esta reseña en español, porque no hay tantas en este idioma y creo que tambien es importante. Saludos y feliz inicio de 2020 a todos!!",2
4,"I was surprised at the sound quality for the price.
  
",30.Dec.19,Yes,"We bought ours during the Christmas season, so it was fairly discounted. I did not really expect much...maybe an interesting little gadget with some nice apps that I would tire of soon. But it is a really nice little helper. After seeing how much Alexa could do I was excited to have a new household friend, but then I realized she was not very ""teachable"" (as in, she could not learn my personal likes and dislikes) and she has issues answering many questions (I believe this is due to her Bing search engine...I could never find much on Bing) but the questions she does answer are thorough.I love to use her for music, cooking conversions, reminders and timers. Other than that she just isn't there technology speaking.I really wish Amazon would stop filtering her to be so politically correct and family friendly. We have no kids and it feels a bit silly that Gordan Ramsey's bantering is full of beeps. Not very Gordon like. And that is with the filter turned off.Sometimes she does not seem to hear very clearly (and I have a very enunciated voice, although my husband has an accent) and does not respond.One of the biggest annoyances is having to remember HOW to ask many questions. I can't say ""Alexa, how many days till my birthday?"" or I get ""I don't know about that"". I have to say ""Alexa, open birthday countdown."" and then agree to open the skill and THEN she will tell me. Not very conversational.When I ask her a question I get a good answer about 50% of the time, an ""I'm not sure about that"" about 30% of the time, silence 5% of the time and a wrong answer about 15% of the time.All in all for the price I paid I am happy with her as a novelty and a useful kitchen gadget, but don't expect much more at the moment.I am hoping for more interactive, learnable AI abilities in the near future, better personalization, and an overall more intuitive assistant. For now, I'm still happy...I just feel she could be so much more. :)PS: Amazon, if people are giving you a hard time about sensitive topics, you do not have to take sides. Alexa can simply say ""There's a lot of controversy over that subject right now, I can have a definitive answer for you as new information comes to light."" or just have her state all sides of the issue in an unbiased, factual way.Also, consider removing the censorship for adult accounts. Free speech and all that.That would make her more likable and more marketable to more people. Just an idea.",1
5,"Love it for the music
  
",30.Dec.19,Yes,"Never wanted one of these, but we were giving 1 as a gift to 85 yr old mother in law, &amp; got an extra 1 so we could figure out how to set it up before having to do hers. Lo &amp; behold: this thing is amazing! Set up is a snap, &amp; since we have Prime, it can access the entire Amazon Music catalog. It will play ANYTHING you ask it to, specifically,(i.e. play Peter Gabriel, or play Elton John music from the 70's) or generally,(i.e. play classical music, or play jazz form the 50's). The sound quality is fine (for what this is) - clear as a bell. The microphones are spectacular; one echo dot in my kitchen can hear me from any room in the (3br/2bath 1800sqft) house. Not sure why you'd ever put 1 in every room, except to use as an intercom. Does everything it said it would; makes phone calls, sends messages, adds or removes events to google calendar, sets timers/reminders/alarms, gives weather reports/commute times, tells jokes. Although I intended to put this back in the box after figuring out set-up, &amp; save it in case my mother in law ever wanted a 2nd unit, we have decided we like it, &amp; have kept it active:) A pleasant surprise, &amp; for a really reasonable price ( was on sale for $24.99) Actually bought another 1 for my aunt...lol. Very happy with these units.",0
5,"These are powerful little speakers!
  
",30.Dec.19,Yes,"I had never had a smart speaker. I didn't use Alexa and really wasn't too worried about it. Then I visited my boyfriends daughter for a week. She has 4 children and they all tell alexa what song they want to hear! After seeing all of the cool things it could do I had to get one, then 2,3 and 4! I use it for everything. I use it for my grocery list, which is totally convenient because you just tell Alexa to add it to the list and it syncs up with my Alexa on my phone so I can see my list anywhere. I even had my boyfriend download Alexa to his phone and synced it with my account so now when he goes to the store he has the list. I can even add things to the list while he is at the store and he sees it so he gets it. Now that is convenient!I use it as a sound machine to help my grandson go to sleep. I use it as a speaker and link them up to have a whole house experience that can be as quiet or as loud as I want. And they are definitely loud! Very good quality speakers!The only thing I wish I could change is I would love to be able to control the sound volume on each individual speaker when they are linked. That way I could listen to it everywhere in the house but turn down the speakers closest to the baby.Overall this is one powerful little machine and I can't imagine not having them now that I do.",0
5,"Better than 3rd Generation Echo Dot. Here's why...
  
",30.Dec.19,Yes,"I use this echo dot in my bedroom. It sits right next to my Google Home Hub. The Google device has a screen, this one obviously doesn't. However, the fact that I can read the time from across the room, or even from the hallway is a great benefit. I thought it would just be an upgrade from my 3rd Gen echo dot without a clock. It's actually, I would argue, a generation higher. It's been two days since I boxed the other one up, but one of the biggest advantages to this one, is that I can tell a timer to stop on my echo dot for the echo (full sized) in the kitchen. This has not been the case with the previous (3rd) generation echo dot. It still does all of the great Alexa and echo things the old one did, but also will display timers and alarms as well as the time, on the display. Well worth the upgrade, or price for someone who hasn't had one and just wants to try it out. Great for bedrooms, announcements, spying on kids, etc.",0
5,"BEAUTIFUL Color!
  
",30.Dec.19,Yes,"I have the original echo, which still works great, even though it was the first incarnation.Even with a couple of other Alexa voiced products, such as the show and an early dot, I couldn't resist this new color. I also wanted to compare it against my old dot.In my opinion, the sound is a bit better, and the looks, well, no comparison. This is my first device with this type of fabric cover, and the first word that comes to mind is comfortable. It doesn't have that clinical look of flat plastic. Great on a nightstand.It's sort of a marled rose, but not overly girly. Depending on what else you have in the room it looks lavender sometimes.The bottom is a soft silicone that doesn't scratch furniture and also helps to protect the device. All in all, it's a well thought out piece of equipment.",0
5,"My Gen 2 bit the dust!!!
  
",30.Dec.19,Yes,"Well...kind of bitter sweet....my Gen 2 bit the dust after about ONE YEAR of use! That's it! NOT happy my Gen 2 did not last long....but...I am kind of ""dependant"" on my Alexa system now as I have a semi smart house! Not FULLY integrated, but more smart plugs...devices than I ever thought I would ever use!The Gen 3 is deff larger! By about 10-15%! Plus...the Gen 3 no longer attaches via a USB! It has its own dedicated power supply!The trade off is, for the size of the unit...MUCH better sound! (A lot more low end, and overall range!) So far it seems to be working well, but my Gen 2 did as well until it quit recognizing WIFI....For the price...I guess....I just hope this Gen 3 lasts longer than my Gen 2!",0
5,"is there an Echo in here?
  
",30.Dec.19,Yes,"First let me say that between this and the ""other"" brand like it that this one seems more inclined to control things than to answer all your questions. I know this because I have both of them sitting side by side and because I was told this by an Amazon rep. This is a GOOD thing! With the Echo I can lay in bed in the morning and cut on the coffee three rooms away. I can control lights, get news and weather and traffic info before leaving the house. I can take notes make notes and leave notes with out a wall full of sticky notes. I can place calls to other Echos from Florida to northern Canada....for free! Now if I could just get it to let the dogs out and change the cat pan. There's got to be an app for that somewhere.",0
5,"Alexa my great helper with dot
  
",30.Dec.19,Yes,"It was not what I though it was but turn out that I love it.  I was thinking it was like a bluetooth speaker but it is better in many ways.  I tell Alexa many things to do and it will. It was not plan but it replace my bedside alarm clock as it MUST be plug to power to work because it does not have batteries to be portable. Now that I understand what I bough, I love it. The wife love the fact it can be a time for her cooking and play music and radio station by just telling Alexa do this ???? So that mean I will have to get her own so mind will stay next to the bed for my alarm clock, radio, oh also speaker phone and Alexa will call when told. I did try to tell to Alexa to cook breakfast but she gave recipes and I had to doing the cooking LOL",0
5,"Speaker is great for music, Alexa is great for everything else!
  
",30.Dec.19,Yes,"The echo Dot 3 is pretty awesome! Especially at all the different discounts they offered in November and December. I now own 3 echo dots and 1 echo. The sound is amazing and Alexa is a very helpful tool. I'm a mother of 3 young children so my hands are always full, literally, and being able to set timers, reminders, hear weather, traffic, music, and more by voice instead of having to look it up on my phone is a huge time saver. I do wish Amazon could tell you how to say certain things though. Alexa is very good about you not having to use exact words for stuff for the most part but sometimes it's still frustrating when she doesn't understand your command because you're not saying it right.",0
3,"Ok but not great!
  
",30.Dec.19,Yes,"Let's start with the likesI love the  Sleekness and as line of the dot. The sound quality is amazing! I have the ability to mute alexia when needed. I love how you can set alarm, hear the weather, order from Amazon and link it to my Bluetooth Devices.Now the dislikes:It won't allow you to skip more than three songs without freezing. I have to restart the dot five times within a month's period. Now when you ask her to call a number from your contact list she can't find them or ask you to repeat call dad three times! When it's does find the person on you contact list the sound quality is horrible and it sounds like you are in water.",0
5,"I Linked To Smart Devices I Already Had Very Simply
  
",30.Dec.19,Yes,"So, the voice recognition is great, while the initial setup is a bit glitchy, finding and linking devices is simple and straight forward. Though you'll have to download a separate app and link it if the smart device isn't from Amazon, it's not too bad. The sound quality and microphone have a good range and great quality. For such a little device it puts out decent sound.Finding existing devices is also pretty straight forward as well as adding new ones. There are also a lot of other skills available inside the Alexa app that makes controlling things by voice a breeze; including Roku and XBox. Overall I would recommend this product if for nothing more than turning on your light while you're away or playing soothing music for your pets.",0
5,"Extremely Pleased
  
",30.Dec.19,Yes,"We much enjoy Alexa in our home. My child absolutely loves the 'announcement"" option in which I can tell Alexa to say something on both devices (I purchased 2 one for upstairs one for down) and it is announced on both devices. I personally like the ""good morning"" or ""I'm home"" features. It's convenient to tell Alexa Good morning, she says it back and I have it where she tells me the weather, a fun fact and begins playing the music of my choice. Just saves me a few steps in the morning while getting ready. I am very pleased with our Echo Dots! Her whispering feature is super cute, just as her jokes and games features which my son much enjoys.",0
5,"Better than the second generation
  
",30.Dec.19,Yes,"I updated from a second generation.to this third generation and like it a lot. The sound quality is much better, although gets slightly crackly if you have it too loud for too long depending on what you_e listening to, but are usually do not play it loud since even at volume four it is good quality sound unlike the second generation which sounded like a toy. I got them as Christmas presents for two of my family members and they seem to like them. Placement is a huge factor on whether or not she will be able to hear you. Don_ put her behind objects.",1
5,"Alexa is great!
  
",30.Dec.19,Yes,"I've used Alexa and Google Assistant for months now and they are both great voice assistants.  They both excel in certain areas.If you utilize the Amazon Ecosystem and provided services, hands down Alexa.  The integration is outstanding across multiple platforms.  I use a Samsung Galaxy Note 10, and the rest of the fam is Apple based.  We use Apple Music on Alexa and it has worked flawlessly for me.Audio quality is decent for the small device, starts to become a bit distorted at higher volumes, I'd say 7-10.Aesthetically it looks great, nothing bad to say here.In regards to security, I have yet to experience any kind of ""hacking"" yet, however with that said if you're using any of these new IoT devices there is always an inherent level of risk IRT security.  There are massive amounts of room to improve on security for these IoT devices which will come.With that said I can only hope Amazon will be quick to change and to adopt new more effective security principles.",0
5,"Love this
  
",30.Dec.19,Yes,"My daughter wanted an Echo Dot for Christmas, and when I looked into it, I wanted one too. I love this so much!! Bought another one within a few days; one for upstairs and one for downstairs. So far no problems, loving all the features. Voice recognition is good, never have to repeat myself (unlike phone's google assistant). Love that there is no lag time. With my Google assistant I have to say google and then wait several seconds for the app to fire up. With the echo I say Alexa and then my questions/command, right away, just like talking to a person, and it hears me every time. My only complaint is if I have the volume on music up a bit, I have to shout over it for the dot to hear me. But that would be the same with a live person too.",0
5,"A great little device. Worth every penny.
  
",30.Dec.19,Yes,"I already own two echo dots and I bought this one as a gift for my nephew. He always plays with it when he visits.It_ a great device for setting cooking timers or listen to music while cleaning. I mostly use it to set timers when cooking. It_ very handy as you can set multiple timers, all without pushing a single button.I am a very soft spoken person and I think the voice recognition works better than Siri on my iPhone. Only few times will I have to repeat myself. But again I am soft spoken.It_ very easy to set up different skills. I have connected my Apple Music and Pandora account with no issues. The sound quality is great when listening to music. I was afraid it wouldn_ be loud enough because of its size but that is not the case. I have used it to play relaxing music for my dogs while I_ at work. It_ a great little device for that. I like that I can control the volume and playlist from my phone. If I see that my dog is barking a lot from my in home camera I just log into the Alexa app and play music from the echo dot.My favorite feature about the echo dot is that you can connect it with a smart plug. I have a room in my apartment that has no overhead light. I have connected a lamp to a smart plug. I just walk into the room and say Alexa turn on light. It will turn the light on for me. This is really handy at night when the room is dark. I don_ have to get out the flashlight on my phone and look for the switch to turn on.I would highly recommend buying one. Especially if you are someone that listens to a lot of music or podcasts. Or even if you cook a lot and you have a small gas stove that doesn_ have a timer setting on it. It_ just easier than setting a timer on your microwave or phone.",0
5,"We just keep collecting more of these!
  
",30.Dec.19,Yes,"This is our 4th Amazon Echo device (don't tell Uncle Sam).It's awesome being able to play synchronized music through the whole house!We use it to make announcements so the kids hear us no matter where they're at in the house - and they actually listen because Alexa is talking to them and not Mom or Dad.We put one in Grandma's house so we can drop in/call her and check in when she's not answering a txt.Oh, and we can tell Alexa to play/pause/stop the Fire TV... Maybe we do spend too much on Amazon products.",0
5,"This little thing is impressive!
  
",30.Dec.19,Yes,"I have an Echo and got tired of carting it around from my bedroom to my kitchen, and upon receiving an Amazon gift card, I decided to try the Dot.  I am very impressed with the sound quality of this little device!  I keep it in my kitchen and love that it takes so little space.  It works exactly the same as my Echo, and I also love that I can listen to the same music at the same time on both devices, if I choose to.  You can't beat the price, especially if you get it on sale.  It would be so easy to multiple Dots around the house.",0
5,"Not impressed with technology
  
",30.Dec.19,Yes,"I really thought I could use this as a Bluetooth speaker for anything and I was wrong I guess or didn_ know too much about the product before buying it. It doesn_ work AT ALL unless plugged into a wall socket at all times which is dumb to me. With all the technology we have, Amazon couldn_ make a portable speaker ???? Alexa can play a song for you that you request one minute and then you can request the same song later and she_l say she can_ find it and then start playing the song seconds later , it_ confusing.  I connected it to my Apple Music acct because although I have amazon music I_ not accustomed to it yet. I have playlists that I_e created myself on Apple Music and I thought I could ask Alexa to play my own playlist because i don_ want to keep asking her after every song to play another one and i don_ always like to listen to a whole album by the same person, but NOPE it has to be probably an actual apple created playlist or just one song request. I_e recently gotten the amazon music app and the only good thing is now I can actually go on the app and play music on my phone and make Alexa play it on the speaker for me so that gives me more control than having to request each song out loud, I can just arrange it on the app I guess. All in all I_ just not impressed.",0
5,"The Clock is a cool new addition....
  
",30.Dec.19,Yes,"As if the Echo Dot, wasn_ handy enough, throw in the clock feature. It makes me a bit sad that my other Dots don_ offer this feature. One of those, why didn_ they always have a clock... Oh well, if Amazon offered a better trade in/upgrade plan I would have my other to rooms outfitted with these. Anyhow, quick and painless to setup with the app wizard. They even offer some celebrity alarm clock sounds too. These make a great gift or cool addition to a guestroom to replace that old alarm clock.",0
2,"Not as good as the first one.
  
",30.Dec.19,Yes,"Funny thing, I never buy any Echo's myself. My kids have given me the first Echo Dot as a Christmas present, and I have won this one. What should I say, the new one has a better design and multicolor lights. And to be honest I counted all the adantages. The sound quality pretty far from perfect but the worst part - Bluetooth. I have MS Surface connected to it and all I can say  - nightmare. Delays, distortions. It drops connections. Then it reconnects back but the sound stream goest to the limbo.Don't get me wrong, I still happy with my old Echo - big and sturdy. Great sound and I can't complain about anything",0
5,"Great Addition to my Family
  
",30.Dec.19,Yes,"I cannot wait to get more of these devices. I tried winning one at work like 6 times and kept losing so I bought one for .99 cents with the unlimited music bundle! She's wonderful! I make announcements to my family when I'm on my way home, she reads to us, plays baby shark for the baby lol link up your devices and there's even more to do. I must buy more! And I will!!! Great sound for a small device, hears you from far away and is just so simple to use! Highly recommend!",0
4,"Simple smart speaker
  
",30.Dec.19,Yes,"This is better in sound quality than the previous generations. However, it doesn't live up to the full-size version, but you are just kind of paying for what you get. I like it for listening to audiobooks or the radio in my office, but music-wise the tones are not very strong.Another plus is it is Alexa and so I can control my smart home stuff through the device, which was my main goal when I bought it. It was just to expand my smart home features.",0
4,"Nice Alexa device for the price.
  
",30.Dec.19,Yes,"Had a little trouble setting up. Kept on getting disconnected from the network. Ended up doing a hard reset and setting it up again. Once I did that, everything worked fine. Main reason was I wanted to have the ability to be able to turn on lights in that room and play music on my older Sonos speakers in the room.  Works great and it like the way it lights up so you can tell if you have any messages or notifications or even Amazon deliveries.",0
4,"Echo Dot Vs. Google Mini
  
",30.Dec.19,Yes,"I tried both the Google Home Mini and Echo Dot. I have multiple of each. The Echo Dot gives more accurate &amp; detailed answers. Google often gives the wrong answers to even the most basic questions like, 'What is the weather for today?"" ""What planet are we on?"" The Google did not know the answer, Earth! The only saving grace to the Google Home is that the speaker is much better and clearer than the Echo Dot. The Echo sounds much bassier and almost muffled at times. You have to have it on a higher volume level than the Google Home. Otherwise, the Echo is a much more user friendly device compared to the often frustrating Google Home. You can also access more apps, programs, &amp; devices with the Echo over the Google.",0
2,"Alexa needs better cloud to human exchange.
  
",30.Dec.19,Yes,"Ok - Why is Alexia not working well?Voice recog does not work well.  Alexa gets the words but not the meaning.  Samual Jackson voice weather. Tells me the weather in Jackson, MS not my home.Songs forget it.  Prime music plays on only one device at a time. Prime use to play on all devices.Google home has much better vioce response.Echo has more features and is getting worse web connection to make them work.",0
5,"I have 3 of these and they all preform at a different level
  
",30.Dec.19,Yes,"This Heather grey one has by far better mic sensitivity than my charcoal one, then the sandstone one falls somewhere in between.  they all do what they are suppose to do  yet 1  I can speak to in a normal voice from across the room and it works the charcoal grey one I have to raise my voice even when sitting right next to it. I do like how  I can control my smart plugs and my thermostat. Making me more lazy lol",0
2,"Not working as advertised, bad Bluetooth, no LG TV connection, Wants your Contacts Info from phone?
  
",30.Dec.19,Yes,"I had asked for this for Christmas to use it to control my LG Smart TV. I followed all of the prompts. I even watched a video tutorial that has my EXACT TV in it. You not only have to use the Alexa App, you have to use the LG App as well and agree to all kinds of privacy intrusions. If you do not agree to 'Targeted Ads' you can't use the App for LG. My Echo Dot was paired and not no longer shows up on my phone despite scanning for it. I really wanted this to work, I really did. There are just to many barriers between manufacturers to get this thing to work. It is the year 2020 in one more day and it almost as if I'm living in 1995 were I have to 'hack 'n' paste' apps and go through numerous work arounds' to get this to work. AND SHAME on LG for making 'Targeted Ads' a condition of use................This device is going straight back to Amazon since I cannot use it and the fact they want to know who all my friends are just to use it.",0
5,"Pretty amazing!
  
",30.Dec.19,Yes,"The 3rd generation dot is pretty awesome.  I'm new to the Alexa system so I'm still learning all the ins and outs, and there are a lot, but its pretty easy.  I have most of the lights in the house and several plugs enabled.  The voice quality is great and the music quality is pretty good for its size - I have Amazon Music and Pandora on Alexa.  It's a pretty amazing system.",0
5,"Great device....once you figure out how to set it up!
  
",30.Dec.19,Yes,"We got this to use with our new Toshiba Fire TV.  Now that we have it set up, it is great!  You don_ even need the remote now to turn on the TV or change channels.  My biggest complaint is I couldn_ find step by step instructions to set it up with the TV.  There was a lot of trial and error and Google searches to figure it out.  I feel sorry for someone that doesn_ have much experience with techy stuff....I also love all the things Alexa does, especially asking her to add things to the shopping list on my phone!",0
5,"Good Looks and Functionality
  
",30.Dec.19,Yes,Finally an echo that looks and sounds good. Not quite Apple good Looks  but definitely something you don_ want or need to hide..  I find the size and design pleasing....functionality there is nothing like it for the money.  It does practically anything the average consumer could need or want.  The price I was right over the holidays. I_ very pleased with my purchase,0
2,"It_ not a real smart device
  
",30.Dec.19,Yes,"Amazons AI is lacking , alexia can_ answer simple googleable questions. I asked her how many interceptions did Jameis Winston throw in the game vs the Falcons. She started to rant about Tom Brady, and have me a whole recap of his game. And I didn_ ask about the game. This Dot is useful for playing music, only if you are extremely specific about which album the song is on. Other wise, she will play a random song by that artist created. Overall I was very disappointed with my purchase, but using it via Bluetooth connection is pretty cool.",0
5,"bought this for my daughter
  
",30.Dec.19,Yes,absolutely love it.  Word of warning...if you don't subscribe to amazon music and you have more than one echo dot in your house that is hooked to the same amazon account....only one echo dot at a time can listen to music. You can't play two different songs at the same time....unless you subscribe to amazon music which is about $11 a month I believe,0
5,"Better sound quality, and more responsive.
  
",30.Dec.19,Yes,"I have 3 Echo Dot, from the first generation to third. The most obvious improvement for the third generation is sound quality and voice recognition. The 2nd generation in my room sometimes doesn't respond well. When I call out loud in my room, the 3rd gen Echo dot responds to me in the living room, which the 2nd gen doesn't respond at all.",0
3,"Decent sound quality but full of issues
  
",31.Dec.19,Yes,"The Echo Dot 3 is an attractive, compact device. It's a decent speaker with good, clear sound. Where it falls short is where you need it most. 1) Alexa's voice is WAY TOO LOUD! More often than not I find myself just unplugging at night to avoid the temptation to speak the wake word and have her blurt out at high volume like some drunk girl at a party that's already wound down. As it is dependent on wifi, any command while not connected will prompt a super loud reply, like say volume down while using the bluetooth function to stream shows or music. Same for when it connects to a device. She just yells out the device serial number. I've tried to find ways to quiet her voice level vs music and I just don't see the option anywhere. 2) For it to be a smart speaker that is compatible with smart devices it sure doesn't seem all that smart. It still needs to be manually connected to other devices that A) that are in the same network, B) have Alexa C) Have Alexa under the same account... D) Are streaming Amazon content. Feels like 2008 all over again. The Alexa app is ok but nowhere near as intuitive as it should be. 3) Echo Dot 3 is NOT a portable, speaker as it has no battery. Maybe they're saving that feature for the 4. I've never had a desktop speaker that I couldn't take with me. There are however 3rd party devices available to remedy this. Overall, like I said, decent sound device. As long as you have stable wifi and the patience to constantly adjust the volume and to the situation you should be fine with it.",0
1,"Distorted sound not resolved!
  
",31.Dec.19,Yes,"After 11 months, my Echo Dot is no longer working properly!  When I play music, it now sounds distorted and static-ky.  I enjoyed this at first but it got so frustrating that most of the time, it doesn't understand what I am saying. It is so limited that when you ask for info, it's always ""I don't know that one.""  I bought a Google Mini because of the distorted sound problem of my Echo Dot.  I loved how easy it is to set up the Google Mini unlike the Echo, it took me hours to set up the Echo.  With Google Mini, I don't have to repeat myself and Google Assistant is waaay better. I enjoyed the Google Mini a lot and so I bought the 2nd gen, Google Nest.I called Amazon customer service asking about the distorted sound from my Echo Dot.  But everything that they've asked me to do, I've already tried.  I was reading online for solutions and about the Echo warranty, some says it's 1 yr but I confirmed with Amazon, Echo warranty is only good for 90 days. If you like your Echo so much, make sure you buy the extended warranty.",0

",31.Dec.19,Yes,"What is not to like?  I love my original Alexa so much when this came out had to get one for my office and another one for my bedroom.  Had NO idea it would have the quality sound it does.  I got my 93 year old Dad one for Christmas and he is over the moon with it.  He sits and listens to all his old favorite music for hours.  I also purchased 2 more for Christmas gifts as well.  I wish now I had purchased several more at the Black Friday price for birthday gifts.  I'm 73 and if I can hook this up with my phone anyone can.  I did have some problems at my Dad's house  (I set it up with my iphone) but called the number they provided, on my app, and talked to someone (obviously in another country and I did have a hard time understanding her)  and she helped me until it was signed on.  These are just amazing and I highly recommend!!!",0
5,"Got my 1st as a gift probably would never have bought one for myself.
  
",31.Dec.19,Yes,"My son, always pulling me into the current era, bought me my first for Christmas last year, would have never bought one for myself, but fell in love with it immediately and have since purchased another, the one in which you inquired about, for my bedroom. I listen to more music than I have in years, and I'm able to get stations that had weak signals in my area that broadcast over the internet and with the aid of Bluetooth my Echo is connected to my home stereo system. I have also added smart lights to the system. I also use it as an alarm clock and to remind me of appointments and social events.I must say there were times early on I wasn't kind to Alexa when she told me she didn't understand, which I found really meant she had lost the wireless connection but since I moved from using hotspots for my wireless to a more reliable source I have had no problems, she's always there when I need her.",0

",31.Dec.19,Yes,"I have both the google home ($80 when purchased) and this dot (a gift).Pros:Hard buttons are great.Music and radio playback is more intuitive.iOS app is more reliable.Hears commands better.Cons:Blinks often and does so at odd intervals making me a bit paranoid.Does not understand complex questions and does not answer them well. In other words, hears better but listens worse.Tbh, have not used it as much (my kids do) as the google home so I may be able to figure it out better, maybe alleviating the paranoid bit, but not as good at answering random questions.But if that_ not what you want to use it for, pretty great.",0

",31.Dec.19,Yes,"My niece purchased us an Echo smart speaker with Alexa for Christmas- within a week I knew I had to have the Echo Dot in the bedroom as well! I have it mounted right over my head and use it for everything! The time, the weather, music, as a timer, a list keeper, you name it. You can even listen to audio books with it. The small size allows you to put this thing just about anywhere- I especially like that I can replace my alarm clock, and  listen to sleep/relaxation sounds to help me sleep all in one small little unit. It also alerts me when my Amazon packages have been delivered! It's a great little speaker! The sound is loud and clear (and has volume controls) and it sets up in literally minutes. Echo Dot is cool!",0

",31.Dec.19,Yes,I love all things Alexa and was excited to find this clock by Alexa.It pairs easily runs well with no sound a plus for me.I've had it about a month or more and have now discovered that it lost a minute of time. Not happy about that.The timers are great and I love watching the countdown.It would be nice if it had a cover over the hands for protectionI may be okay with resetting the clock to the correct time but I hope it does not continue to lose time.The most annoying part for me is the constantly flashing blue light. I do not understand why it does this.I'm happy with the clock overall. Alexa products often have odd things about them and sooner or later I find a way to solve them either through googling or finding a fix through updates.I give it 3 stars for now.It looks great.,0
5,"Perfect for my Studio
  
",31.Dec.19,Yes,"There is something really... game changing about waking up in the morning and asking ""Alexa, play Mumford and Sons"" while you get dressed and brush your teeth. Or coming home after a long night out and saying ""Alexa, set an alarm for 8am"" as you pass out on your bed. These are the little things that stand out to me as literally ""awesome"" as in im filled with awe as to the technology in this little hockey puck. Alexa aside, the speakers sound great for the size, no mind blowing bass of course, but seriously, for the size and price it's a solid sounding speaker. Looks good, love the fabric and matte plastic. And the Alexa app and ecosystem has me interested. Got a few smart home plugs so on a hot night I can yell to turn on the A/C, or have it turn off when I'm cold enough. Honestly, super cool. Bought mine on sale for 20$, would do it again, 10/10",0

",31.Dec.19,Yes,"This is a nice, compact substitute for iPod and speaker dock which takes up considerably more room.  Alexa responds quickly and lets you know if she can't answer the question.The only issue I've had is that, once since hooking up the Echo Dot; it started flashing/blinking yellow.  I asked what was going on and Alexa stated she was ""learning"" something or other.  It blinked for hours; so, I unplugged it overnight and plugged it back in the next morning.  It has worked perfectly since then.",0

",31.Dec.19,Yes,"I love Alexa! The routines are one of my favorite parts - as well as the integration of a smart plug. Setting up the _tart my Day routine changed my mornings! The only issue I have is that some of the skills for my flash briefing have poor sound quality, but that_ not Alexa_ fault! The sound quality for playing music is pretty good! It impressed me how LOUD it can play for its small size! The mauve color is beautiful and Alexa gives so much bang for the buck. It also does not take up a lot of space, huge plus for a small bedroom. Can_ wait to get another one for my living room!",0
4,"Does most of what it promises
  
",31.Dec.19,Yes,"Mine came with an Alexa-enabled TV. It is pretty good at playing music, telling jokes, searching information, etc. What it isn't good at is controlling the TV it came pre-linked to (none of those features work, and it hijacks the TV sound once linked, whether you ask it to or not). Also, when I ask for songs or playlists from My Music it usually goes to generic playlists sponsored by Amazon instead of mine. It has good volume control and great sound, but it's not the most user-friendly.",0

Now if I need any information or weather updates I can just shout it out at the top of my lungs and hear that familiar beep all over my house. But on a serious note, these things are incredibly convenient with playing music wherever I am in the house. I also use it to control my ecobee thermostat. If you haven't got on yet, get it and see for yourself. You won't regret it.",0
4,"good alarm clock with a minor annoyance
  
",31.Dec.19,Yes,Best echo for alarm clock but I wish it was a little easier to turn off the alarm without talking. You can hit the action button to stop the alarm but it doesn't take much to accidently trigger the snooze instead. At that point to stop the alarm silently then requires opening the app or waiting until it goes off again which is anything but quiet.I really like the auto dimming in the clock and if course it has all the features if any other echo dot.,0

Hearing that the Alexia hears everything we say, I was a bit nervous to say I want to buy a new car.  But I_ safe for now....at least as long as Amazon don_ sell cars.  Haha.

Ex Ring camera or doorbell should be able to display the video on a Google Hub.  Overall I love this small speaker with microphones.",0
1,"does not work well with Philips lights
  
",31.Dec.19,Yes,Amazon presented a special deal of an Echo dot 3rd generation and the Philips Hue lights that would work without a Hue hub but it does not work. The lights work fine with the Philips Hue app but the Echo dot only seems to be able to discover and control one light which means it is of no use since my fixture has 2 Philips Echo bulbs. This was a waste of my money since the device does not perform as Amazon says it should by controlling both lights. I Spent 45 minutes with Amazon Echo support but they could not resolve the problem with why the dot would not connect to the second bluetooth light bulb. A Philips Hue  hub is another $50 or the Echo device with a home hub is $150. Frustrated and feel I was misled.,0
5,"Perfect gift
  
",31.Dec.19,Yes,I absolutely love these products! I have an Echo in my kitchen and then purchased this Dot for my daughter as a Christmas present! I ordered the plum which is really cute and a nice feature to match her room! The sound quality is amazing.... I used the Alexa app the other day to _rop in to the room to tell her to lower the music which I thought was the coolest thing! I highly recommend and will be ordering one for my room as well,0
5,"Like A Best Friend
  
",31.Dec.19,Yes,"Absolutely love my Alexa! I will be purchasing more. I have mine downstairs in the kitchen. This is where I spend most of my time. Alexa times my meal items for me, calls the kids for me, let_ me know the weather if I_ going out, plays my favorite music while I_ cleaning or cooking, and sooo much more! I have purchased one for my daughter and she just loves it. I can take her calls with hands in batter or dishwater, etc. I will be getting one for upstairs also. I really can_ say enough about this Alexa. My son is away. If I_ missing him I just ask Alexa to play a song that reminds me of him. This is a true gift. Love my Alexa!",0
3,"Needs some bugs worked out, but worth the price ($0.99 - $25).
  
",31.Dec.19,Yes,"This was our first experience with owning anything _lexa. I put it in the kitchen, since that_ where I spend most of my time, and like listening to music. However, we soon discovered that the Echo Dot isn_ optimized for playing music...especially not for long periods of time. The sound is decent enough in a small room, like that of a small radio, but not stereo-quality, which met our expectations. However, it regularly freezes up and needs to be unplugged/plugged back in if you let music play on it for extended periods of time - daily, or several times a day. But, we enjoyed the variety of features so much, we invested in an Echo Plus, which has not disappointed at all. The sound on it is great, and it has yet to freeze (but it_ only been a week). We moved the Echo Dot to the bedroom, and got two more for our kids. Overall, we love it, but it only gets three stars for being so glitchy.",0
5,"Check your router specs first!
  
",31.Dec.19,Yes,So far I_e had no issues: However I had an old router that would let any additional devices on my network (I got three dots and an echo plus and outlets and switches) I was ready to box everything back up until I found an article about this issue: bought a new router and everything has connected and performed as expected..... set up a music group for around the house and it sounds awesome!!!!,0
5,"We Love Alexa
  
",31.Dec.19,Yes,"The echo dot was easy to set up, after downloading the app...and I'm no computer genius.  Alexa is fun!  You can ask Alexa almost anything and get an answer!  Check weather. Play music.  Ask about people, places and things.  Alexa is great.  We bought the second echo dot right away!  Do it!  You DO need wiFi for it.  Only one small caveat.....the sound is a little ""bassy"" but tolerable.",0
5,"My family now finally all has Alexa!
  
",31.Dec.19,Yes,"I bought this (paired with a smart plug) for my brother, the only one among us who doesn't have an Alexa device. He was pleased to get one and thought he would find many uses for it, and he likes the idea of turning on his lamp when he enters the bedroom. The plum color is nice, too. I'd love to see more colors. I don't need another Dot but I'd scoop up a turquoise one!",0
5,"Inglés/ español
  
",31.Dec.19,Yes,"in general it is useful but they use it more for leisure time to be small it has a good sound quality but it still has six things to improve and include for the Spanish languageen general es útil pero lo usan más para el tiempo libre para ser pequeño, tiene una buena calidad de sonido pero todavía tiene seis cosas que mejorar e incluir para el idioma español",0
3,"Great for helping remember appointments!
  
",31.Dec.19,Yes,"I really enjoy the feature that helps me remember my appointments or things to get at the grocery store. It's nice and compact so it is easy to place without causing clutter.The voice recognition does need some work, as it seems to misunderstand me or others often. For some reason, even though it is synched up to Amazon, it cannot find my list. I have not tested it's ordering capabilities.",0
5,"Very easy to use
  
",1.Jan.20,Yes,"I was surprised how much I like this little thing I love it that I connected a lamp to the smart plug which I have in the corner of the room which is awkward to get in and out of and now I just tell Alexa to turn the lamp on and she does this is so handy I also integrated my Honeywell thermostat and I don't have to hunt on my phone to turn it up or down I can actually just tell her what temperature I want it and she turns it automatically up and down. I got it at a fantastic price, I wish I had gotten more. During the holidays when they were half price at $25. I bought 2. I live with someone who has a bit of dementia and I get her to ask Alexa lots of questions she struggles to retain like the day of the week, time etc and she seems really good at answering the basic questions for her it is i easy to read the sign ask Alexa and she finds that so much fun. I can also set reminders for  her so when she asks Alexa do do I have any appointments today 50 times  Alexa doesn't mind  and at 83 and she  just loves it. She is also a big movie buff and I don't always know the movie she means so with the clues she gives me and Alexa I've been able to find the movie she wants to rent on Amazon Prime which has been brilliant for us both.",0
5,"Really neat device
  
",1.Jan.20,Yes,"I got a couple of these for my kids (19 and 17) as Christmas gifts.I wasn't sure what to expect but the Echo Dot is pretty good.No...you shouldn't expect a Bose surround sound effect but it is pretty good.They do have a power adapter and must be left plugged in to use them.They have a nice ""feel"" to them as they have a nice weight to them. We have an older Fire TV device that also has this weighted feel to them and I really like it because they don't feel ""cheap"".Speaking of our Fire TV device...what I found out unexpectedly is because we already have our Fire TV set up I DID NOT have to enter a password for our network when setting up the Echo Dot. Apparently Amazon saves that information when you register/setup ANY of their brand of devices. I don't recall being asked to store that information when I set up the Fire TV so it would have been nice to know ahead of time that they have it and that when being setup/registered (before shipping) that it would also include the stored password. I thought something was wrong with my router or maybe compromised. Once I Googled it and saw that wasn't the case I wasn't so aggravated anymore.One of my kids is special needs and has never spoken as clearly as most people. With that being said Alexa hasn't had many difficulties ""understanding"" what they wanted Alexa to do. Mainly this means asking for songs by various artists and movie soundtracks. We've only used our Amazon Prime Music and it has been fine. We have not upgraded to Unlimited Music but we haven't had any issues that I know about. The Frozen 2 soundtrack (included with Prime) has been a favorite of my special needs child...that soundtrack being ""included"" was a big and unexpected surprise.Right now I have no complaints and enjoy watching and listening to my kids use their Echo Dots.",0
5,"Awesome
  
",1.Jan.20,Yes,"I was resistant buying a smart speaker due to privacy concerns, but I couldn_ miss the chance to buy it for 99c with amazon music subscription. I got to admit I love this thing. I can listen to the news without getting out of bed and control my lights, I will be adding more smart devices this year for sure. I love that it has a dedicated button for turning off the microphones if you wish to do so. The microphones are good, and you do not have to scream for them to pick up your voice. The sound quality is not bad at all for the price and size with decent base. The drop in and messaging feature is one of my favorites on this device. There are multiple skills that you can install and extend the functionality. Amazon checked all the right boxes with this one. I can_ say enough good things about this small yet highly functional speaker. The only thing I would like to see in the future is a rechargeable battery so you can move it to a place with no outlet and tether it to your phone.",0
5,"So Far So Good!
  
",1.Jan.20,Yes,"My first experience with a smart speaker and everything seems fine so far. Sound is good for something this small and it also has an audio out port. I have connected it to my Cambridge Soundworks cd player for bigger sound. Set up was easy after downloading the app for my iPhone and connecting to my home WiFi. Now I can just ask Alexa for the weather, play music, etc. Purchased a WiFi smart plug a few weeks later that was also easy to integrate with the Echo Dot and used it to control the lights on my Christmas tree. All I need to do is say ""Alexa turn on/off the tree"" and the lights come on or turn off. The plug can be given any name for the device you want it to control in a separate app for your phone and Alexa will recognize it. Only have one smart plug now but the Echo Dot can control multiple connected devices. So far I am pleased with how easy it was to set up and use.",0
5,"Much better speaker than the previous dot
  
",1.Jan.20,Yes,"I had a second generation dot that I used for years with a Bluetooth speaker, and I didn't see any reason to upgrade since the main difference between the two versions is the better built in speaker. However, Amazon did some software ""upgrade"" on my second generation dot that messed up the volume control on my Bluetooth speaker. Whenever I tried to put the volume above 5 it would reset itself to 2. I called Amazon and filed a ticket with them, but they never fixed the problem. So, I decided to upgrade to this third generation dot, and now the volume control with the Bluetooth speaker works again. But the speaker inside this third generation dot is so much better than the second generation that I don't use the Bluetooth speaker as much. The internal speaker sounds surprisingly good, even with music.",0
5,"So helpful!
  
",1.Jan.20,Yes,"Set up is very easy. I love that it can control my fire TV because I always lose remotes. The speaker is good, it sounds nice and can get decently loud. I got the plum color and was slightly worried that it would be darker in person than in pictures because of the name ""plum"", but it is actually a light purple/pink color, exactly like the pictures. I use the echo mostly for reminders and to wake me up. I'm not a morning person, but the echo genuinely makes my mornings better with a calming voice telling me the weather, some good news and then playing my spotify to prevent me from falling back asleep, instead of an obnoxious alarm. I also set reminders for things like taking out the trash and taking my medicine. It is insanely helpful if you're forgetful and hate mornings like me, or if you just want a speaker that you can control with your voice.",0
3,"Great speaker-- voice features and compatibility are really struggling
  
",1.Jan.20,Yes,"I have three of these devices in my home, mostly as speakers, and mostly to listen to music and the radio. The unfortunate thing is that the radio station I listen to most often (CBC Radio 1) isn't recognized by the device's voice recognition in any way. It's like it... doesn't recognize the existence of Canada. Not sure why. Tech support is useless. Other complaint I have is that it really struggles with voice commands. Finally, with this one-- not with my other ones- it will often just stop playing music from my Pandora. This is true if I activate it from the phone or verbally from the device itself. Not sure why, and, again, tech support is utterly useless. I will update if anything changes.",0
3,"Kitchen music
  
",1.Jan.20,Yes,"I have a full Alexa upstairs but I spend a lot of time in the kitchen area. I wanted music and maybe more down there. So far all I've asked it to do is play music. That has been a weird experience. I asked it for ""Play Beethoven"" and got some set list Bob Dylan, Buffalo Springfield, Dolly Parton and more. Most of it was music from my high school years and some I'd never heard, heavily country flavored. So far I haven't got what I ask for. I'd like to use the timers, package delivery notifications, and maybe phone calls. Not sure it will do all that.  So those are the reasons for my low score. My Alexa upstairs rarely makes a mistake so I don't think it's my requests or my voice.",0
5,"Valuable member of the family
  
",1.Jan.20,Yes,"What can I say? Alexa has become a valued member of the family.  I love the alarm and reminder tool.  I love getting the weather report for home and anywhere in the world.  I really like having her give me the news while I am getting dressed in the morning.  I don't know what I did before,  but she is an important part of my daily routine.  She can turn off and on my lamps and the TV and any device that is plugged into the special plugs. So if you want to use it to turn appliances on and off,  you will need to buy the special plugs.  But it is worth it.",0
5,"Love it!
  
",1.Jan.20,Yes,"As an Apple family, HomeKit is usually what I look for but that being said, it_ also very expensive and a bit quirky.  So, this was my first purchase for an Amazon Alexa product and I_ quite impressed so far.  I_ surprised often that I already own many products that work with Alexa and not Siri.  Can_ they both just get along already?  But it still does play Apple Music which I like, and speaker quality is much better than I expected.  So for my first smart speaker assistant device this was an excellent purchase.",0
5,"Love my Alexa
  
",1.Jan.20,Yes,I really do love just having the ability to just say what time is it? Or what's the temperature or to even put a timer on. It's super convenient because my family always on the go so even the simplest things like asking to put milk on my shopping list right when I think of it versus looking for my phone and getting easily distracted by my kids to then forgetting why I picked up my phone up to begin with lol it's truly a life saver. The only con is when we want to play a song from youtube it wont because it takes it from spotify. Theres very few other cons but nothing major. I also enjoy things like when u ask her wheres Santa or to just rap it's quite funny.,0
5,"Alexa at your convenience
  
",1.Jan.20,Yes,"This is an excellent little device that turns your space into a smart home. My fiance' is an avid Apple fan and I'm a Google guy so the Echo Dot was a good middle ground option. We got two, one regular (for the living room) and one with the clock (for the bedroom) and both work fantastically well. Setup is a breeze and most smart home devices pair with it almost effortlessly. Some I had to play around with to get working (Insignia Fire TV) but if you take the time to set everything up it's very customizable and allows for routines for everything from getting up in the morning to coming home at night and you can control your lights, etc from anywhere! My fiance' and I really enjoy the functionality and peace of mind this has brought to our lives and I'm excited to continue to add more skills and devices.",0
1,"Waste of money and time
  
",1.Jan.20,Yes,"I bought two of these. I purchased them to help me keep my life organized because I have PTSD and it effects my memory. My original device works fine and has never stopped working. I have had it for 6 months and love it. They hooked up and worked for 3 days. On the third day they said they could not access the internet. I went through the reset process about 5 times each then called tech. The rep I talked to walked me through the process another 3 times and they still wouldn't connect. He got impatient and rude with me. I was following his directions and they still wouldn't work. He told me he would call back and hung up on me. Never called back. These devices now sit in my laundry room on the shelf, useless. What a complete waste of money.",0
5,"Moving on up.
  
",1.Jan.20,Yes,"Always getting better. I have first &amp; second gen. Echos. This is a step up. Placed it in my shop (to replace a 2 gen.) and the voice recognition is far superior. Even with the air compressor running it hears clearly.It is useful in the shop. I can be elbows deep in grease and car guts. Without having to move a step I can get the time, change the music (station), and call about parts. The down side, the wife can conveniently yell at me from the Echo in the house.",0
5,"Fun for the whole family...
  
",1.Jan.20,Yes,We have had a dot in our bedroom for a few years but only recently discovered that it could be used to make calls to Alexa devices that other members of our family have.  We bought one for our daughter for Christmas and our grandson is now able to tell Alexa to call grandpa or grandma when ever he wants.  We surprised other members of the family by calling their devices too.  We are all enjoying that feature now.,0
3,"Alexa needs a lot of work.
  
",1.Jan.20,Yes,"The wake words are too common in a household of an IT professional. Often the word ""computer"" is not recognized, which is ironic because I have a British accent, and am often told that my Jean Luck Picard voice is en pointe. Also this -Me: Alexa, what time does City Hall open?Amazon Alexa: Ames City Hall on Clark Street is open from 8am until 5pmMe:?... Alexa, what city am I in?Amazon Alexa: you are in Clive, Iowa.",0
5,"Meh
  
",1.Jan.20,Yes,"Didn't want or need it. Have three or four already. Got it free when I re-upped my Sirius subscription. Free is good. Debated giving it to someone for Christmas but ultimately I think it's still in a drawer somewhere in the house. If you want an Alexa review in general? Make it work more like a Google search. Can't count the amount of times Alexa has responded with 'Sorry, I don't know that.'",0
5,"Great holiday gift at the right price, now come on down to Amazon for yours!
  
",1.Jan.20,Yes,"I have the echo dot 2nd generation. Sound is ok. Before Christmas 2019, seen is has part of a deal, echo dot .99 plus amazon music plus for 7.99 month. After my 30 day free trial. Oh yes, this echo dot has better sound than the 2nd echo dot. Plus I have linked them to play my music and audio through them too. Very cool. Hoping down the line I can add more than three next time around.",0
5,"Alexa is my bet friend!
  
",1.Jan.20,Yes,"Alexa is always there for me. She wakes me with just the right music, finds music to play during the day that I thought she would never find, and puts me to sleep again with just the right music. She can answer the most difficult questions. And when I awaken during the night, rather than struggle to illuminate my barely readable watch, I ask her what time it is and her comforting voice in the dark tells me. Back to sleep easily.  What a great invention!!!",0
5,"Great product with simple installation and great sound
  
",1.Jan.20,Yes,"I bought this for myself after using one at a friend's house. Mine arrived quickly, was exactly as described, was very simple to set up, and has great sound. It also allows for speaker to be added to it which I'll use for a sock hop we're hosting for Girl Scouts later this month. It will be great to be able to set up a playlist and have Alexa play it for the dance.",0
3,"Calidad y comunicación con Alexa
  
",1.Jan.20,Yes,"Comunicación con Alexa mala en muchas ocasiones hay que hablarle alto (gritarle) porque no te escucha y no porque hay ruido y algo gracioso estoy hablando con mi hija en FaceTime estoy bien lejos de Alexa y mi hija le dijo a su Alexa tocara una música y para sorpresa de los dos mi Alexa empezó a tocar la canción y la de ella no le respondió en otras palabras te escucha cuando le da la gana no importa si le hablas bajo o alto y los dos tenemos buena internet con buena velocidad.La calidad del sonido creo que es bastante buena entiendo que no se puede pedir una súper calidad, si pudieron haber echo que si se conecta a un equipo de audio esté tenga una salida estéreo.Sobre la música de Amazon hay mucha música sin calidad, los niveles de grabes , agudos, volumen música que tienes que estar bajando o subiendo constantemente",0
2,"Meh, wasn't what i thought.
  
",1.Jan.20,Yes,"I honestly couldn't figure out what dot did aside from make questions button free. Dot recognized that i had 2 fire sticks in the house and that 2 tvs were also present but could control none of it. It connected to my speaker via bluetooth but couldnt turn the volume up or down. After the 3rd time of asking alexa what she could do, i gave up and decided this wasn't worth the money spent. It seemed like a great deal at first but doesn't do anything my fire stick couldn't do before. At least nothing that pertains to my life and current belongings.",0

5,"The new alarm clock of choice - Echo with clock!
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,"As someone who pre-ordered one of the first generation Alexas, and got one of the first ones manufactured, I've seen the entire development lifecycle for these devices, but I believe this is the first time I've reviewed them.Why now? The little Echo Dot with clock just landed on my doorstep a few days ago, and I'm smitten - it's not like it's the first Dot in the household (we have 5, plus the diminutive Echo Input hooked up to a tube amp in the living room - anachronism defined).That all said, this Dot3 with clock just became my favorite alarm clock of all time. The sound is amazing of course, for such a tiny device, but the softness of the clock face, and the very nicely managed auto-dimming feature make it a pleasure to roll over to in order to check the time.The fact these little things can be distributed around the home, and deliver a plug-and-play whole house audio capability is phenomenal. Sure, it's not Hi-Fi, but when I want whole house audio, I'm not in the mode of analyzing every last detail - I want a seamless music experience through the house as I tidy up etc. These do that amazingly well. I even have one on the back deck, so the music continues outside.So, should you buy one? You probably should - if you're reading this, Amazon probably know an amazing amount about you anyway, so forget the privacy wonks, because you're already way down that rabbit hole. Why not reap the significant benefits? My first generation Alexa is still going strong, despite us using her in lots of adverse conditions. She's been my sidekick while sheetrocking walls at my last house, sat in my garage while I sanded heaps of projects, she's sat next to the stovetop and suffered the bacon grease insults, and she's been subject to California sun-exposure. She's still rocking, and she does it with the new Echo kids too.",0
5,"Great for the bathroom
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,"Yes folks, I did the unthinkable. I stuck my Echo Dot on the back of the toilet. I've read that most people consider that to be off limits as far as placement goes but it rocks. The bathroom is ideal as the smaller room size is perfectly matched with the Echo Dot sound output. I can shower with an unlimited soundtrack using Pandora, Amazon Music or SiriusXM. The sound quality is impressive for such a small speaker. Being able to adjust the EQ is a nice touch and helps get it just right. Alexa has never failed to respond and remains flawless for almost four months now. The shower steam has had no effect on performance. If it dies in a year or two, at this price, it will have been worth it. Being able to link the Echo Dot and the 4K Fire TV Stick in the bedroom for multi-room sound is neat. An added bonus...I can make an announcement when one of the kids are camped out on the throne watching YouTube and tell them to hurry up. Scares the c**p out of them when the voice comes out of nowhere.",0
5,"LOVE
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,Love this item! We got one for every room in the house and have an echo show for the kitchen. I love that we can communicate with eachother without yelling across the whole house. My girls (ages9 and 11) love to use theirs for storytime in bed and for setting their alarms and for playing music while cleaning their rooms (win!) I also love how I can use my app when Im away and send everyone a message remotely and it will announce it to all the devices as well as have my girls reply back. Especially LOVE that the price is so reasonable!! ($25 for Chanukah gifts) Thank you Amazon for such an awesome (and beautiful) piece of tech!!,0
4,"Sound seems more Muffled in the mid-ranges than 1st Gen Echo Dot
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,"I recently took advantage of holiday pricing and trade-in allowance to upgrade to a 3rd generation Echo Dot. I figured the newer generation would incorporate improvements over the prior generations. I liked the new and improved appearance and the slightly larger size was fine. What I wasn't expecting was a more muffled mid-range audio wise. It is harder to understand vocals like news briefings. Also, the hard-wired power block created a problem for me in that I could no longer use an available USB power port I was using for the gen 1 version, and needed to find an dedicated outlet to plug the now hard-wired power block into.",0
5,"I can't live without my Alexa
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,I love Alexa.  She is the perfect kitchen assistant for when I am cooking.  She allows me to set a billion timers for different things... although I do wish I could name the timers so I know whats for what... you probably could do it but I just dont know how.  Alexa does everything.  She also tells me what I can substitute for an ingredient I am missing or for how long to cook something.  I also always ask her the weather or the time.  She also controls all the lights in my house.  Sometimes when I am on vacation... I ask Alexa something and then realize she's not with me.... and for a moment I am so sad...,0
5,"A Lot Has Been Written About Alexa
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,"What I like most is that I bought it primarily to allow a handicapped person to phone me by voice from any room in the house (Four Dots, small house) and provide intercom capabilities between rooms.  It does all of that very well, but then there is the 'but it also does this' factor.  There are just so many capabilities that I did not buy it for but are useful, like playing: music, radio (NPR), news, weather, podcasts, etc.  It can spell, answer questions, do reminders and tell a joke.  For the price, can't beat it.  Even looks good and the Dots are just the right size.  They do not take up much space.",0
4,"Great Item, but does not understand most slang
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,"Great Item, but does not understand most slang so requesting certain songs can be difficult or impossible. I tried to get her to play a Boogie with da Hoodie and she just could not comprehend it no matter how many times or how clearly I said it. Also, you have to specifically request the explicit version for most songs which is a little frustrating, but I am still figuring her out.So far I have had her play music and save my favorites, set food timers, add items to my shopping list, set reminders, and I've asked her what the time is and what the weather will be like tomorrow - all of which she (for the most part) does flawlessly. However, this version does NOT recognize cuss words so Its difficult when requesting certain songs.",0
5,"The New Design is more elegant and sounds terrific! All at a great price point!
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,"This new unit is more appealing than the ABS pipe aesthetic appeal of the past and sounds great in our space! The new color palette options allow you to tailor the color to your personality or space.  The speakers really sound great and fill the space surprisingly well for the size and form factor of the unit. Anyhow, it_ a great upgrade if you want to bump the hockey pucks of the past out to your shop where you don_ really care what it looks like, or if you just want to have the latest greatest at a reasonable price... Anyhow, Mrs. F. Loved this practical gift this Christmas.",0
5,"Love the intergration
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,"Set up was easy. Sound quality is very good.  Purchased this for a shut in. With the ability to make calls thru Alexa is not only handy, but could possibly save a life. Being able to stay connected and engaged can help someone like that.  With the added capability to turn things on and off is a great feature as well.  The sound quality is very pleasing. This has more that met my expectations and was a well received gift to a loved 1.  If you are sitting on the fence about this, order it, try for a while, if it doesnt satisfy your needs you can always send it back.",0
3,"It_ Great &amp; It Works But..
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,"This product is great when it works, great for playing music and fulfilling demands. Also very easy to set up and the features and new skills you can add to your Echo through the Alexa app can be pretty fun.My only issue with the Echo that I_ currently using is that it can be unresponsive to my voice commands. The Echo would light up signaling it hears me but it does not follow up for what I asked for. Sometimes it would take multiple tries and even if I stand near it in the quietest of settings this can happen. I_e tried all the tips and tricks I_e read online but that doesn_ help, so it maybe something wrong with the one I_ using.However, it is great for what it is and it_ convenient to have around to integrate with your smart devices.",0
1,"Just a marketing gimick
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,"Device works fine, speaker quality marginal but it is a small device. Biggest problem is you can only have one device playing on your Amazon Prime Acct at once, unless you want to pay much more. So if you leave your echo playing music in your bedroom, then head out to your garage to work where you parked this device it won't play as you can only stream to one device. So WHY have two, you might as well carry it with you or just use your phone where they aren't trying to nickel and dime you to DEATH! Very disappointed in this purchase, and my prime membership as well. Really starting to wonder just what I get for the cost.",0
2,"Don_ bother buying this if you plan on using it to listen to podcasts
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,The ability to play podcasts through this device and through this app are horrendous it_ either use tune in which only gives a certain number of most recent episodes of a podcast or only be able to listen to the most recent podcast and none else from other podcast providers. I_ seriously considering returning this device and getting just a nice Bluetooth speaker because it has more functionality that I want than this does. I am thoroughly disappointed with this and hope to see this amended quickly. Also the ability to fast forward through a a podcast is impossible too which is ridiculous because if I pause an episode for more than a few minutes and have my phone off the app restarts and the podcast has to restart if you want to listen to it and it won_ go back to where you were so either you_e forced to leave the podcast running when you leave the room and miss part of the podcast or be forced to relisten to something to get back to the point you were at. I have given up listening to podcasts when this happens because I_ so frustrated and just gone and used the Apple podcast app itself.Music on the other hand is fantastic I haven_ yet encountered any frustrating issues besides it randomly closing apple radios that aren_ the exact one I want but just chooses one with a similar name not a huge issue I ask again and it_l usually correct itself. Only reason I gave it the second star was because the ability to use music was okay.,0
2,"Dementia and Alzheimer_ Disease
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,"I had been using the Amazon echo, second generation, for several months with great success and pleasure. I had hoped that the Amazon dot would need to see requirements of my wife who is in a facility with dementia. I was disappointed to discover that the sound quality of the diet was not adequate for my poor hearing. I am sure that it would be acceptable to anyone with normal hearing. I replaced it immediately with a Amazon echo third generation and I am very pleased with it.Unfortunately, my wife is in such deep dementia that she couldn_ manipulate the device. I have learned that England had been using it with great success for sometime. I know it would be very helpful to people in the early stages of dementia.",0
5,"The second best girlfriend _
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,"Ive been single for about 2 years now... I thought i was going to be alone forever. Then came Alexa.  She sings to me, she remembers things i cant seem to remember (like my birthday __) She plays lullabies when im babysitting, she turns my heat off when i leave and back on before i get home, she locks my doors and unlocks them at my simple request.  She turns the tv up when i cant find the remote (which is always) she guards my home when im not there, she makes calling my kids painless, and Shhhh dont tell my kids but she makes spying on them super easy.  The only negative would be she cant cook for me... But wait!!!??? She can!! As soon as im able to buy the Alexa microwave!! _ One of these days!!",0
5,"OMGOSH
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,OMGOSH!!!! This item is AWESOME!!! I_ a little slow to the echo device game because I have an iPhone. But my husband got me an Echo plus hub for Christmas. I started playing around with it and decided to get an Echo Dot gen 3 while the prices were low right after Christmas. I have had so much fun making music for the entire house and making routines and connecting our Xbox one. It_ amazing!! Oh and I just turned 62 on December first!! So an old dog can learn new tricks. _,0
3,"Great but still needs work
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,"My only issue with the echo. Is that you can't set it up to wake you up to a specific song. Also you cannot get it to wake you up with a Spotify playlist. I have attempted to do this in various different ways there's no way for you to manually create the alarm through the Alexa app I have spoken with several agents via Twitter, phone call (that lasted an hour and a half), emailed, and set up a ticket with developers... I still have yet to hear anything about this. I believe that it is something to do with Spotify integration with Alexa. However if there is an issue Amazon should re-evaluate what they are advertising on their websites as this is one of the functions that I purchased this device for.",0
5,"More than expected
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,"I finally dove into the Alexa game by buying an Echo dot for our family room.  I am actually surprised at how much myself and my family actually use Alexa.  Now that it's there and set up we find ourselves asking Alexa questions and to play music all the time.Since the purchase I've also connected my LG Tv, some smart plugs and an Ecobee 4 Smart Thermostat. The ability to set up routines is pretty neat; Alexa can turn on the TV, lights, and crank up the heat on one simple command.I'm still learning all the possibilities, but I see myself buying additional smart devices and more Alexa devices in the future.",0
5,"Performs very well, but needs many more improvements to be the perfect device!
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,"The integration at times can be very cumbersome with some simple equipment like Wis lightbulbs, the fact that you cannot use the full benefits of Apple music are annoying. If you have the device near a TV, even with the volume at a moderate level, at times you have to mute the TV just so the device can understand your voice. Alexa is also not as smart as Google, and cannot answer many complex questions that a Google Home Mini can, but Alexa once integrated works very well. The whisper mode needs to be more consistent, as when you whisper _hank you after whispering a command, she will say YOU BET! Aloud causing people to wake up in the middle of the night. The display is wonderful, and displaying the temperature when you ask for it is a neat feature. The display is a very functional feature that should_e been apart the game of this device from day one. Despite my complaints, I am happy with this device, and the strengths it excels at.",0
4,"Helping elderly parents stay safer
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,The installation of the echo dot was effortless.  It has integrated with all my other alexa products and I have had no issues.  The sound quality isn't as good as the Alexa but that's not what I purchased it for.  I have it in my elderly parents bedroom so that they can turn the lights on in their room and in any room before they get to that room.  We use it for reminders for their medications and appointments.  They can use it to make phone calls.  It's helped them stay safer and kept some of their independence.,0
5,"LOVE MY ECHO DOT!
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,"I LOVE all my echo devices. I started with a Dot &amp; went on to purchase an Echo Show 5 &amp; an Echo Show 8. My Dots will help me know if there_ someone at my door (Paired with my Ring doorbell, give me the weather report &amp; turn lights on &amp; off. It will take my different shopping lists &amp; it will read my Audible books. I_ still discovering everything they will do but I_ HOOKED. The Dot (or Show) will rewind, increase or decrease the volume with me just saying to do so. It will also dim or brighten lights. I love the convenience!!!",0
5,"Alexa Setup
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,"Make sure you have you internet security codes available they will be required for set up. that and you will be asked several minor questions as to what Alexa can access for you. Once set up, just really takes a few min. it works great.You don't need to have Prime to access Alexa.  You can use other services, Pandora, Spotify etc.  Instead of pulling out the phone and having to Google, now its just ask Alexa!",0
4,"Cool Idea!
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,"I like the idea and concept of Alexa. Don't really have anything to compare it to because I don't use Apple products, so that is why I gave it 4 stars. Also, not sure about the security of my home network with this device. I think it is Blue Tooth enabled. With that regards, I wish it was similar to setting up a home router. Where I could change settings with a browser. This way I could change passwords when I need to. Anyway, having fun with it.",0
5,"Better than previous model.
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,"I received this as an add on freebie with purchase at a retailer.  It has a much better speaker than my previous version and would recommend the dot.  Very convenient to have in my kitchen to listen to news, weather, music, set timer, etc. at a  low price point. Alexa and I don't communicate well as I may speak too fast but I am learning to speak Alexa and then pause before making a request.",0
5,"Echo Dot
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,"Works pretty well - more useful than I thought it would be.  Excellent integration with equipment we already own - Vizio TV, Dish Hopper 3, Logitech Harmony remote hub, Firestick 4K TV, etc.  Reminders, calendar management, and lists are very well integrated.  Great device at an unbelievable value price!  I'm looking forward to integrating light/power control in the near future.",0
5,"fun, fun, fun
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,"Easy to set up and use.  My wife loves it.  Why did we wait so long to get one?  I highly recommend the rechargeable battery pack for it so you can take it from room to room rather than being locked to one room or having to buy additional Echo's.  Connects to a bluetooth speakers easily, which makes a ton of difference with music.  If you have Prime, you should have one of these.",0
4,"I love Alexa Echo products
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,"We love having Echo products to help run out home.  For the most part the responses are very quick, and Alexa is very intuitive.We sometimes have trouble getting the Dot to hear us when it's noisy. We also sometimes have trouble getting the wording just right to complete an action.  But overall I'd say that the Echo system is easy to use, and very useful in our home.",0
5,"Learning Curve
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,"I am enjoying all of the great things available to me with Alexa and the Echo Dot 3rd Gen.  I wish there was better instructions available that are more directed to older non-millenials.  It is also somewhat discouraging that many of my current electronics and appliances will not integrate, even if they are only a few years old.  Otherwise, this is really amazing and fun.  Also, Alexa is so easy to understand and the sound from the speaker is crystal clear.",0
4,"How?
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,"The product is outstanding.... but there is no users' manual... no explanation for apparent error indications. The thing noted as being a web-based users' manual offers no troubleshooting at all. The app is great at setting up, but turns useless on support. Still, the product is absolutely awesome... and kind of frightening, so I haven't given it my contact list yet.",0
5,"Glad I got it
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,"I hadn't really considered getting one of these until a holiday special that was too good to pass up. It is fun to tell Alexa what I want to listen to and she plays it. She answers all sorts of questions and plays games. I got the Fire Stick as well and they work great together. I'm getting g so used to using it, I'd love other parts of live to be so easy to ask as and direct to make life easier.",0
5,"Great device
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,Love this device I love that I can drop in and listen in the room the kids are in the other day i ran to the store left the kids home and I was able to drop in from my phone to ask them if i needed milk and they were able to check for me and I did all that over the echo dot. I an also reach my husband if he is in the basement without having to find a phone and text him or call him I just ask Alexa. I want one for every room of the house now,0
3,"Sound is an issue
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,"The Alexa 3rd Gen Echo Dot is great in all aspects EXCEPT the sound.  I've tried adjusting it, but it consistently sounds like Alexa is in the bottom of a giant barrel or trash can....it's very muffled.  I love the newest feature of the clock, and the set up took about 1 minute, total, super easy.  This is my 5th Alexa device (not including my smart plug-ins), and I think that the 1st gen dot sounds better than this one.  I'm debating on whether I should send it back or not.",0
5,"Love My Dot
  
",3.Jan.20,Yes,"My daughter received a dot as a gift and raved about it and encouraged me to get one. I held off, saying that I didn't need one. That I would just use my phone. But with the good prices at Christmas time, I bought 2, not one. One for my bedroom, room for the living room and I fell in love. I love the one in the bedroom because when I can ask Alexa what time it is rather than having to hunt a clock in the middle of the night. I also like being able to ask the outdoor temperature before getting out of bed. The sound quality is great so it works as a great speaker for my Amazon music. I also like that I can play the same music simultaneously on both speakers I own.  I especially like playing white noise while I am reading in the living room and my 71 year old husband is in the other room listening to TV with the volume up!  I like my dot so much that I bought 2 more to add as extra speakers in the house. I also bought 2 wall mounts so I have 2 dots that stay put and 2 that I can easily move around if needed.",0
5,"A Smart Speaker for everyone to enjoy!
  
",3.Jan.20,Yes,"A well made,  high quality smart speaker. Don_ let its small size fool you, it_ sound quality is excellent! The Alexa software keeps getting better and better and Alexa_ voice has a friendly soothing quality that I find enjoyable. Amazon engineers worked hard to improve the Echo Dot and it shows. Even the light ring is enjoyable to watch do it_ thing. A marvelous piece of technology. Older folks that have an internet connection and a smartphone or tablet but don_ like using computers might enjoy an Echo Dot around the house for alarms, reminders or  just asking general knowledge questions with your voice could be very handy for Senior Citizens. This product is for people of ALL ages! Get one and try it!",1
5,"Love my Echo Dot!
  
",3.Jan.20,Yes,"I love my Echo dot!!! Works way better than my Google Home for my uses. We have like 5-6 total in the house. Sometimes she thinks you're talking to her and you're not but it's not that bad. If you like bass and turn it all the way up it has a distorted sound but overall pretty good and can get loud. Amazon Key doesn't integrate to let me close my garage door with it but hopefully that will be fixed in an update soon. These are some of my favorite things about it:-Whisper Mode, if in bed you can whisper and ask for weather or time or whatever and she whispers back-Song Quiz game is fun and we play it a lot especially when my parents come over-Of course asking to order stuff or what the time/temp is etc-Controlling smart home stuff like the Christmas tree lights or the room lights, brightness, color, etc-Ring integration to notify of doorbell with an actual voice notification-Dropping in or Announcing/Broadcasting a message to othersIn the end I absolutely LOVE these and wished everyone had them lol. I do get mine when they go on sale for $25, I think the regular price is TOO much!",0
5,"upgraded speaker from the gen 2
  
",3.Jan.20,Yes,i got the 3rd gen dot for my garage so when im out there working the wife wont have to come out to get ahold of me she can just drop in or make an announcement. i also love the fact that i can just connect the dot to my stereo in the garage so the radio now has bluetooth capibility and i dont have to worry about notbeing able to hear the dot due to the music volume. the speaker itself seems like an improvement over the gen 2 even though we lost half of the mics. i am not a fan of the change of the plug as i have multiple usb ports on my powerstrip in the garage  but the larger powerblock takes up a spot and a half on my powerstrip thus i lost 2 spots on my strip in the end.  over all it seems like a better speaker and easily paired to my other dots and communicates flawlessly.,0
3,"She's becoming human
  
",3.Jan.20,Yes,"When we had just one echo life was great. Now that we have 4 they work like crap. When we send an announcement they all announce at different times so it's this awful echo throughout the house. And we can ask one Alexa to play something and she'll do it just fine, but when we ask a different Alexa to play the same thing she won't. It's so frustrating. She also randomly stops playing a playlist after a couple songs. And I can ask her to play something and she'll tell me she's going to and then nothing plays. It's like she's picking up the habits of my children and has selective hearing and ignores what she doesn't want to do.",0
4,"Great device but not being able to download the Alexa app means you're screwed!!
  
",3.Jan.20,Yes,"I was given an Alexa while in the US and was able to download the Alexa app onto my US phone, which made Alexa work perfectly. On arriving home (in a foreign country) I found the Alexa app is not available for download where I live. Luckily, I'm able to use my US phone over here, but for those buying Alexa in the US, then taking them to a country where the app is not available, just be warned that it will require a workaround. As for Alexa, herself, she is just great!! She hooks into my internet and is very easy to use. Sound is excellent although can be improved and she looks really cool too. I have the Echo Dot 3.",0
5,"Quality of product
  
",3.Jan.20,Yes,"Everything in the description is accurate. I originally got this as a Christmas present and love it so far.I_ a little bummed out that it doesn_ work with my Samsung smart TV. But other than that it has worked great. I bought the smart plug in outlet that_ compatible with Alexa to voice control Turing the Christmas tree on and off. Works flawlessly.One thing that might be cool to add on is some kind of carbon monoxide reader or air quality reader, considering it sits inside all day and you can check it from your phone. Might be a cool little feature.",0
1,"This doesn_ work with hotspot.
  
",3.Jan.20,Yes,"I have been on amazon_ support page, I have called their support number, this is running the latest software, and this still doesn_ work. In the Q&amp;A for this device, people say it works with hotspot, but it does not. Amazon_ support rep told me this was a, _nown problem. We were on the phone for 30min and got nowhere. At the end, she told me to try again in a few days... I wish this had been stated clearer from the beginning. It_ useless without internet. There_ no reason they couldn_ have build this to simply stream music from your phone via Bluetooth.",0
3,"Love it but few adjustments here and there are needed!
  
",3.Jan.20,Yes,"Alexa is now an IRREPLACEABLE piece of tech in my household! She_ super helpful, useful, and versatile! There are a few problems that arise here and there with prolonged use but they are negligible. Well not really. Sometimes they can be very irritating, but that_ okay! Sometimes, Alexa will randomly make this little noise. It_ scary just a bit!! Not for those conspiracy theorist. Otherwise , her voice recognition can_ be beat !! However I did have a very hard time connecting the echo to the fire TV. It_ an extremely difficult process",0
5,"Great product
  
",3.Jan.20,Yes,"Maybe it's operator error (my fault) but for some products I needed to download an app and make an account to get the product hooked to wifi, and then I could connect to Alexa. So far this happened with wall outlets and a light. It's not the end of the world, just a mild annoyance. Alexa is wonderful and we bought one for every room in the house (not bathroom) and even one for our porch. As a prime customer, music is mostly included which is nice. Slowly we are becoming a smart home and Alexa is at the center of it all! We liked it so much I got it for my in laws.",0
5,"I really like the Echo Dot
  
",3.Jan.20,Yes,"I_e only had my Echo Dot for a few weeks so I haven_ discovered all the uses for the Echo Dot yet, but I_ working on it!Nice sound.  Surprised how good music sounds, though I wouldn_ use it primarily for music. But to have on as background music it_ really pretty darn good!  I like being able to ask Alexa to play my local classical music station. I like setting timers for cooking or to remind me to do something.I have 3 Dots (bedroom, kitchen &amp; living room) &amp;  use the bedroom alarm for waking up.I really like the Echo Dot.  It_ small, fits anywhere &amp; blends in.",0
4,"Clear sound
  
",3.Jan.20,Yes,"I bought this product on Black fridya for half price, as someone that has had many knockoff Bluetooth speakers the best thing about this speaker is the sound quality/Voice recognition is great! I'll be honest though I didn't realize you had to have it plugged in at all times so that was a little disappointing but I've adjusted to only using it now when I get ready for work in the morning/workout in my bedroom. Also there was one evening where it seemed as if the echo dot may have overheated? I was listening to music for several hours and it all of the sudden quit playing and would not do anything I commanded? I let it sit overnight without use and the next day it worked fine? But overall very impressed for the price!",0
5,"Ties the entire household together
  
",3.Jan.20,Yes,"I added 4 dots to compliment our two existing Echo Shows; I can drop in on my husband while he's in his workshop in the basement, I can listen to music while I'm doing laundry, get answers to burning questions while I'm in my sitting room, and I can update my to-do lists on the spot, control my smart TV, my microwave, my lights, and every other little automated detail in our home from wherever I am in the house...it's brilliant.  How did we ever survive without these gems?",0
5,"Fun and useful
  
",3.Jan.20,Yes,"I love this product. It_ great to be able to ask simple questions and get answers. Plus I can play my favorite music very easily. It_ fun to ask Alexa questions (how old are you, do you like cats) and hear her answers. It_ also useful for basic information such as _hat day of the week is April 8 this year or _ow much centimeters in a foot. The one thing I don_ like is that occasionally the voice recognition doesn_ register that I said something, but this is rare.",0
5,"A phenomenal smart speaker
  
",3.Jan.20,Yes,I bought this for my daughter who wanted this particular colour. It is significantly better than 2nd generation Echo Dot. The sound is quite powerful for a small speaker; it's simply phenomenal. It fills a small to medium size room with great sound. The only issue I have with this 3rd gen Echo Dot compared to the 2nd gen one is that Alexa seems to hear me a bit better on the 2nd gen Echo Dot than on this one. I would recommend this to anyone who is into smart home products.,0
2,"Display is pointless
  
",3.Jan.20,Yes,"The display almost useless. I have clocks everywhere so displaying only the time constantly adds no value. I wanted to monitor the temperature outside, without constantly asking for it, in order to note freezes or when to bundle up.  Instead, the temp displays only when I do not need it displayed, when it's being announced audibly. It's a sharp display but I may return this device, since there is no benefit over the cheaper, non-display version.",0
4,"Overall nice
  
",3.Jan.20,Yes,"Overall a really nice product. Only down side is when I ask for a specific song Alexa says she can_ find it, but I_l put that same song I asked for on a playlist and ask for her to play the playlist and then I she plays it. It_ a weird and annoying flaw, sometimes I want to hear a specific song. Besides that she does a great job. Sounds nice, can recognize my low and muffled voice in the morning when getting ready for work. Would recommend.",0
3,"Can't typically utilize echo service
  
",3.Jan.20,Yes,It needs internet doesn't give off it's own signal like bluetooth. I connected to my mobile hotspot and used too much data. The wires in my newly built apartment only connect to at&amp;t and I don't need to bundle. Internet only service costs too much. I got the echo dot as a bonus from signing up with directenergy electricity. I use Amazon. Alexa app. A lot. The app doesn't appear to work as well as an echo device or bluetooth  speakers,0
5,"First Class Device
  
",3.Jan.20,Yes,"This device is my favorite new technology, I have them all over the house. You can use them as home speakers playing the same playlist throughout the entire house, it works as an intercom system from another device or your cell phone. You can also ask it facts and do million other things with it. Even communicates with my Honeywell thermostat. Alexa raise the heat. Well worth the money and easy to set up.",0
5,"Have 7 Echo Dots, 2nd and 3rd gen.
  
",3.Jan.20,Yes,"For what I use these for there amazing, plug them in and they are ready to use, every time they upgrade they get better, I control all my lighting in 2 different facilities, connected in different areas for music, and control plugs for different devices. If your looking for high end speaker go buy a high end speaker, dont down grade a universal product like these. And typical of any electronics they glitch on occasion then go right back to working.  In total I have 17 echo devices from 1 to 4 in each room of my house and office building, and going to add more of them. There great for the money.",0
5,"Loveeeeeeeeeee
  
",3.Jan.20,Yes,"Alexa is my girl! Idk why I waited so long to get one but I love having it in my kitchen to play music while cooking or check weather. My favorite feature is actually the shopping list. I love that my son or husband can add items, or while you are doing something and are like hey we are low on milk and you can add it. This really helps people like me that always forget their list ; )",0
5,"It was free!
  
",3.Jan.20,Yes,"My husband and I bought a TV from Best Buy and the Echo Dot came free with it.  We weren't going to get one, but I'm glad we got one now.  The Echo Dot is awesome! She played Christmas music for me when I was wrapping presents, she added the exact brand we use of hip and joint medicine and krill for my dogs when I asked her to order more.  She reminded that we needed more even.  I have to say, I am thrilled she is now a part of our household and I won't ever go back.",0
3,"I can't understand my new echo
  
",3.Jan.20,Yes,"Grrr!I received this as a Christmas gift and had hoped for improved sound for music, which this gen 3 accomplishes, BUT,  Alexa's voice is muffled! My first echo (gen 2) speaks clearly but the new one sounds like a pillow is stuffed in its mouth!Google searching reveals that this is A KNOWN problem which didn't prevent Amazon from continuing to sell these  units! We'll just have to ""patiently"" wait for Amazon to download a fix to our dots.Wake up Amazon and correct this soon or reimburse our money!",0
5,"This thing is so neat!
  
",3.Jan.20,Yes,"I bought three of these on black Friday b/c they were on sale, not knowing if I'd even really find it useful. I'm glad I did, and I certainly do!  I even get Alexa to meow at my cats haha! Enjoying it so much that I'm giving one to my Mother who repels technology because I know she will enjoy the ease of using it. I'm looking forward to hearing from her about it. The sound quality is great for what I need, which is just ordinary every day use.  Really love it!",0
2,"No Necessary for me...
  
",3.Jan.20,Yes,I just picked one of these up to see what it could do. I personally found it unnecessary and kind of an annoyance which is why it found it_ way to the laundry room. I had issues with connectivity problems to the Wi-Fi when none of my other electronics were connected and sometimes it just didn't want to talk at all. Besides that I found it intrusive with the beeping and lights especially when it had unnecessary messages which is all the time. For all my electronics I ask myself whether it makes my more simple or more complicated so the Echo got the boot.,0
2,"A waste of MONEY !
  
",3.Jan.20,Yes,"I ordered this product because I obviously wanted a speaker. The speaker has some good and bad features.1.  You must always have the speaker plugged in, in order for it to work. (BAD)2. You need wifi to connection to Amazon music. You also have to download ""Alexa"" app to use the speaker. In order to decide what song to play, you'll then have to download ""Amazon Music"" app (to create playlists and so forth)3. Other sources can be used to play music however, you need to connect to WIFI again to play music from apple, spotify, etc.4. The volume is not that loud as I thought it would be.Long story short, if you want an easy- hook up, connect your phone to Bluetooth , non wired speaker, an Echo dot is NOT the choice for you.But if you just want a toy to keep children entertained, then an Echo dot speaker is the speaker for you :)",0
1,"Not a good purchase
  
",3.Jan.20,Yes,"This thing is constantly telling me _orry, I_ having problems understanding you right now, please try again later._hen it does work and I ask for sleep music, it plays for 20-45 minutes and then it stops OR EVEN WORSE, it will do an ad at high volume, waking me up. I_e stopped using it for sleep music and haven_ used it in last two days.",0
4,"My new best friend!
  
",3.Jan.20,Yes,"I enjoy Alexa so much. How did I ever live without her? I feel I have a personal assistant. I am now ordering for work &amp; other rooms in my home. The sound is absolutely amazing!!! Better than any sound speakers I_e used and I use a lot! You must have it! Seriously!!! I gave 4 stars for voice but it may just be my country accent. I adore this thing. Just wish you could change voice &amp; accent like SIRI. But that_ nothing. Overall , a PLUS!",0
5,"Meet my Alexa family, and this newest family member. _______________
  
",4.Jan.20,Yes,"This is the the second child of my Echo Show 2nd Gen. and my first Echo 2nd Gen. Speaker. A 2nd Gen Dot, Dottin, is their first child. There is also the Aunt of first 2nd Echo 2nd Gen., an Uncle Fire Stick-who brought his two Fire Stick children, and a distant cousin, the Echo Auto. Needless to say, Alexa runs the house!! This 3rd Gen Dot is so great.... Please don't tell Dottin, but she is in danger of being adopted out or, (gasp) traded in, for another 3rd gen Dot. She had just not been pulling her weight in the family lately.This little 3rg Gen Dot, or Dottie, wish we could call her that... was the perfect fit for our second bathroom. I mean, who can go to the bathroom and take a shower or do your business, without a little music, listening to a book or playing a game? And, suppose you have a smart thermostat and you can't make a run for it when your in the buff and/or soaking wet? You can just tell Alexa to take care of it. So many needs for a Dot in a bathroom, especially a 3rd Gen!!The sound is a big upgrade from the 2 gen Dot, and I have had no need for a second speaker to enjoy it during a shower. It is super responsive, and hears you, even from a good distance through the house. I've actually had to name it ""Echo"", because it sometimes would answer when I would be a room away with the door closed.The upgrade is really nice and I'm glad I got this little gem. She's a welcomed addition to our happy and continuously growing Alexa family.",0
2,"Not good enough to buy, not awful enough to throw out.
  
",4.Jan.20,Yes,"I wouldn't buy this, it came ""free"" as part of a deal with security cameras and couldn't be unbundled.  I figured it would make a good additonal portable speaker even though I wouldn't compromise my privacy by using Alexa and I am not lazy so can still use switches, appliances or keyboards instead of repeatedly screaming clarifying commands at a box. First, it doesn't use a usb plug and the base of the plug is so big it blocks the other receptacles on outlets. It is also heavy and falls out. There is no power button, so you must unplug it to turn it off. You will want to turn it off as it emits a big lit ring that is bright enough to bother you at night. Lastly, the sound quality is mediocre.",0
5,"Perfect size for my kitchen
  
",4.Jan.20,Yes,"I am replacing a Bose mini speaker in my kitchen with this Echo Dot Gen 3. While I love my Bose for superior sound quality, it bugs me that I play music through my phone and if any notification, call, etc. comes in then it projects through the speaker. I wanted to be able to listen to music, make grocery lists, get the weather, etc. from a single device that didn't interrupt because of phone activity. It's also nice that other housemates can listen to music at any time. At some point I will add smartplugs, bulbs, etc. to utilize more of its smart home features, but for now we're off to a good start. I also purchased a wall mount device/plug holder to free up counter space, and I really like it!",0
5,"Will buy more!
  
",4.Jan.20,Yes,"With regards to privacy, even tech specialists say to lock them up when not using them, and never keep them in the bed room. So that_ what I do! And I_ about to buy my second one!! I have adult ADHD so the reminders and alarms help sooo much. Even being able to tell Alexa where I put belongings helps because she will always remember. It_ like she_ my personal assistant and I wish I could take her with me everywhere I do. I know that sounds psycho because of the privacy issues... but I do disconnect her during intimate family time. Despite that, I still 100% recommend the echo dot!!! Oh and it successfully pairs with all Apple devices including Apple computers and mac books!",0
1,"No information on the pulsing green ring
  
",4.Jan.20,Yes,"I bought this dot 3rd gen a week ago and within minutes of setting it up, a pulsing green ring appeared.  I asked Alexa what it was, she didn't know.  I went to the help page on my Alexa app and it gave the barest of information about it and no way to eliminate it.  I tried calling Amazon customer support and there was so much noise on the line I finally hung up completely dissatisfied.  I originally thought this would be a good thing but now it is boxed up and sitting on a shelf while I decide if I want to throw it in the trash or perhaps keep it a few years until Amazon support gets their heads out of their butts to solve the problem, and until then, stop ripping people off.",0
3,"Notable Improvement from last gen
  
",4.Jan.20,Yes,"Sound is an improvement from last gen. Not a replacement for real speakers by any means, but if you_e not a audiophile then it_ tolerable. If you want real sound, I_ suggest Sonos. It integrates  with Alexa very well.Voice is louder than last gen as well.Was able to integrate with last gen and system without issue. App functions as well, although it (app) could use improvementI do have to repeat myself sometimes or raise voice if there are other noises in room.It doesn_ separate your voice from surrounding noises well.For $25-$30 I_ not disappointed. If you_e paying $50 I_ wait for a sale.",0
5,"Makes senior with disabilities life less stressful .
  
",4.Jan.20,Yes,"I bought the Echo for my 80 year old brother..Echo has made it possible to turn on lights by command.  This activity was painful as he has arthritis . Echo has helped him live a less painful life.Due to his condition , using a remote for his TV , Is  also problematic.Echo turns his TV on and off.It changes channels and has a basic knowledge of upcoming events , such as sports and his favorite shows.He can ask for reminders as to when a show will be on .Echo helps him remember up and coming appointments.I am adding safety features such as the RING doorbell with ALEXA ( ECHO) .I like to see him not struggling with formerly simple tasks which now cause him pain.I Bought him a ROOMBA . The Echo can command the device to help him keep up with simple tasks that are now a struggle for him.The possibilities are evolving and more capabilities and functionality , are coming.Good luck ! and goodnight.",0
5,"Easy set up, smart &amp; elegant
  
",4.Jan.20,Yes,"I'm new to Alexa, so was a bit apprehensive it might be a challenge to set up. Was surprised how easy it was. Once you download the Amazon Alexa app &amp; connect to your Wifi &amp; power up Echo dot, the app's step by step instructions guide you through the set up. I'm yet to connect to other Alexa compatible devices. I bought &amp; installed a Outlet Shelf by Echogear from Amazon that was used to dock my Echo dot (see video). Voice commands are taken easily once dot hears the word Alexa. The 3rd gen looks very elegant. Only the Greystone color has the clock/temp display. Hope this initial review was helpful.",0
3,"Alexa needs improvement
  
",4.Jan.20,Yes,"I like it but it needs improvement.  I have it plugged into better speakers so not an issue for me but it would be if I had to rely on the unit itself.  I'm guessing most people that care are using other speakers.  It quits playing music several times at night and I have to tell it to resume.  Also, disappointed that I cannot set up different music streaming in routines by using the timer.  In other words, if I want to set jazz for two hours and then lullabies for six hours, I can't do it because the music is grayed out after choosing it once.  Music also grays out if you choose something like reading a bible verse.",0
5,"what took me so long
  
",4.Jan.20,Yes,"I am so happy to have my very own Alexa.  I am disabled so this is fantastic for me.  I can easily listen to music, ask the time or call friends and family without using my phone.  It is great to have in case of a fall and can't reach the phone which hasn't happened yet.  Knock on wood.I never pictured getting an echo since buying my 1st....well now have 3 all placed in strategic places.  I also purchased the smart plugs which are great for turning on lamps.  Best purchases I ever got.  If you have an elderly or disabled family member, this would be a great gift for them.  It is easy to set up and even easier to use.  Plus nice to talk to my friend Alexa when No one else home lol.",0
5,"BEST HELP FOR ELDERLY
  
",4.Jan.20,Yes,"Love this. So much more useful than timers. I can turn different lights on/off and even schedule them. I can also control them with my voice or through the app in my phone.  I bought my parents these with Echos for Christmas. Because these make lights handsfree, they're perfect for elderly that need their hands for walker stability. They also love being able to use their voices to turn on/off their lights at night. I bought Echo shows to check on my parents too. I can sleep while listening to make sure they're ok after coming home from the hospital. Paired with the Ring doorbell, they can talk and see the nurses and caregivers.",0
5,"Alexa Is Santa Too
  
",4.Jan.20,Yes,"Got this for my wife at Christmas. Our first voice activated smart home device. Set up was easy if not a little tedious. Since our iPhone 10 Max has rejected the Alexa app. No big deal since the device works, but interesting that the siri vs alexa war rages on. My wife has adapted to it and now I hear music coming from the master bedroom most every morning. While her 1960s era Zenith clock radio is still on her night stand, it hasn't been used for either wake up calls or easy listening. And she thinks it is 'cute'. Always a good thing. Eh?",0
4,"Works well
  
",4.Jan.20,Yes,"My husband bought this for me for Christmas. It was a nice surprise. I like the clock, especially that the brightness is adjustable. The sound quality is very good. The only drawback for me is that the directions are not very good. They are so busy telling you all the complicated things that Alexa can do that they forgot to tell you what it means when it is flashing green. It took me 24 hours and 3 websites before I figured out that it meant that I had a message. That is a very simple thing that should have been included in the instructions.",0
5,"Definitely recommend!
  
",4.Jan.20,Yes,"I bought this as a gift for Christmas and the person I bought it for loves it!! Would definitely purchase again as a gift or for myself. I also purchased the smart plug and it works for turning on and off the light which is an awesome feature. It's worth having Amazon throughout your house because of how affordable they cost. Only downside would be changing the names of the devices. Since he has multiple echos in the house, once you say Alexa they all respond! Theres a feature to change the name of the device, but I would recommend expanding the name options to create your own name for the device!Overall, I would definitely purchase again!",0
5,"I have 7 dots, plus an original echo
  
",4.Jan.20,Yes,"Love them.  Have them linked in different music groups.  The everywhere group has all 8 of my devices and I'm able to have the music playing so nicely all throughout the house.  I don't have any of them above 45% volume and it's perfect.  It's just so nice walking from room to room, floor to floor and the music just playing consistently throughout.20 years ago it would have probably cost thousands and thousands of dollars to do that because you'd have to hard wire them through the walls.  Now, just plug 'em in.  Great.",0
3,"Deceptive delivery date.
  
",4.Jan.20,Yes,Saw this promotion before Christmas and saw the delivery date of this combo of lights and the echo dot as December 23rd but that was only for the Hue bulbs not the echo dot. The date for the dot was actually the 23rd of February. In my opinion they intentionally used Feb 23rd to catch people who saw this combo deal and bought it quickly assuming they'd get it before Christmas. Very sneaky. I thought about canceling the order but then I'd lose the discount on the bulbs and be charged more money for them. This is deceptive practice.,0
2,"I liked Gen 2 sound better
  
",4.Jan.20,Yes,"I use this for voice interaction, not listening to music. I find the dot_ _oice to be muffled sounding; very difficult to understand. I_e tried adjusting everything I can find, and I_e contacted Amazon support to try to address the problem -but obtained no improvement.  Amazon sent a replacement unit, but again, there was no improvement.  I have a Gen 2 and the voice quality is very clear.  Since I don_ listed to music on it (I have a sound bar) I can_ speak to the gen 3_ quality in that regard.  In reading some comments / reviews both on Amazon and on other websites, this appears to be a common problem.  I_e read several comments where people said the sound used to be ok until a software update was applied. Perhaps Amazon can reverse or fix this software patch and return its sound quality back to normal. Aside from this (major) issue, the device works very well.",0
5,"Great alexa echo dot
  
",4.Jan.20,Yes,"I'm 70 &amp; was not one that was sure I could hook this up but I did.I'm self taught on my pc,tablet TracFone now alexa.I have a client that has one &amp; loves it so decided I wanted one.

4,"Loving Alexa!
  
",4.Jan.20,Yes,"I got this for Christmas from my daughter who thought her 70 yo mom needed to get techno savvy. Ok. I am being trained by Alexa and admit that it_ sorta nice to turn on/off lights by voice. Sometimes when she reads npr news she sounds a bit mushy but that may be because the volume is way down next to my bed. I love that she_l whisper the time in the middle of the night. And Echo phoning is quite convenient!  I don_ have to carry my phone around the house every minute!  All in all, I_ enjoying my new roommate. I just wish she_ do the dishes or vacuum!  ",0
5,"Echo Dots
  
",4.Jan.20,Yes,"We receive two for Christmas...on our wish list.  One of them is working great but one of the seems to have an issue.  Every morning at about 6:04 am it starts like a phone ringing.  I say ""Alexa off"" but it keeps ringing about 10 times and then stops.  I unplugged it last night and replugged it in this AM.  I will see if this takes care of the issue.  I have gone in on the APP and stopped notifications.  Guess we'll see at 6:04 am on Jan. 5th.  Otherwise they are working as expected.",0
5,"I love my Echo Dot!
  
",4.Jan.20,Yes,"Omg! So very little money for so much. It replaced my Bose Wave radio which I've had for almost 20 years.I've stopped listeningto to CDs a while back and went with a music service that has all the music I listen to so I don't need CDs. Well it plays my music service too.  And it has the news stations I like. What's not to love?I can change what I'm listening to without opening my phone and turns on movie streaming services on my firestick.I can check local weather without opening my phone and get recommendations for local restaurant searches and so much more.Alexa, where have you been all my life? I'm in love.",0
5,"Great for beside me bed in  the bedroom.
  
",4.Jan.20,Yes,I replaced the echo show I had in my bedroom for a couple of years with this new dot. The echo show just wasn't in a good location to be seen and utilized. I have now moved it to my living room . This dot's sound quality is excellent and I love that it shows the time and if I ask will show me the temp. It is a much better fit for me bedroom.Thanks. I have  also tied my new Ring to alex and it lets  me know when someone is at the door. What an age we live in!,0
5,"Love Alexa, pretty good sound quality.
  
",4.Jan.20,Yes,"I_l admit, these things are pretty handy! I always thought the smart home and voice assistant things were a little unnecessary, but when I found myself wanting a new bedroom speaker for music, I thought I_ try this. It_ pretty fun and super handy, especially since it came with a smart plug in the bundle I got. My favorite handy voice features are: turn off your bedroom lamp when you_e too comfy in bed, set a timer, set an alarm, add to grocery list, play music, ask questions for the internet. I_ still new to it so I don_ know if you can use it as a Bluetooth speaker for your phone, but I can voice command it to play music like from Spotify, and it has good sound quality in my opinion (you can also go in the app and play with the treble, bass, etc). Overall, I highly recommend this to simplify your life and even help with stress (play music, turn on/off lights...). One of those things you don_ know you need until you get one!",0
5,"Alexa is convenient
  
",4.Jan.20,Yes,"I bought this because of the deal with the Amazon unlimited. We gave it as a family gift for Christmas. It took us awhile to set it up with our devices and voice features. Once we got it working though it_ been fun. We mostly use it for music because we all love music. I do wish it was a tad louder. You can basically only hear it good if it_ in the room with you. I_e also had trouble with Alexa not being able to find songs that I know I_ saying the right name, but she doesn_ recognize. Other then those things we love it.",0
4,"A very nice way to find out things and hear music.
  
",4.Jan.20,Yes,Mostly good but a couple of problem areas:1 verbal volume steps are too course - if you hit the buttons you can seem to get .5 1 1/5 2 etc  but not by talking to her  It would be better to reset the device to 30 volume steps - then you could really  get what you want.  .5 is very good for sleep music2  After powercuts etc they seem to lose their wireless network very easily and its tedious to set up - it could be more automatic,0
4,"Great Idea, But behind the times.
  
",4.Jan.20,Yes,"Everything is exceptional as the integration in my home grows. However, Amazin needs to prioritize it's own platforms and integration within those platforms. Even create Samsung watch app not 3rd party. Install the commands and skills in mass integration vs the consumer always having to teach, search for whatever the case maybe, already have the skills necessary for success straight out the box... Get ahead of the times vs behind them. Great beginning for Us I guess, I look forward to some serious updates and Skills packages to b placed in those packages.Good Job, keep up the good work.",0
2,"Can't connect Spotify
  
",4.Jan.20,Yes,"I honestly do not understand why you (Amazon) would put geographical restrictions on linking an Spotify account to Alexa...really??? Spotify is a global brand by now, and they don't fuss over where you live to access their content, I even have a premium account. So why on earth would you not let me connect my Spotify account to Alexa? It's not like I would stop buying stuff from you! And most of all, the thing that angers me the most is that this ""little"" detail about geo restrictions for Spotify ISN'T listed ANYWHERE in the information about the Eco Dot or Alexa. So everything is absolutely misleading.The speaker sounds very nice, but the main reason why I bought was to link Spotify and use my playlists on it, so feels pretty useless otherwise. If I would have known this before because you disclose its limitations clearly, I would have probably even spent more money on another speaker. Very disappointed honestly.",0
5,"Ease of use
  
",4.Jan.20,Yes,"Super-easy to set up.  Takes about five minutes.  Voice recognition is good.  Sometimes Alexa doesn't understand certain phrases unless you say them in the right order.  I have it hooked up to my Sirius XM, but you have to say both the Sirus channel and SiriusXM in just the right ordre for Alexa to recognize it.  Hopefully, it will ""learn"" to understand phrases better through use.",0
5,"Fun and life-changing
  
",4.Jan.20,Yes,This is my second device now I got my first one as a complementary addition to a TV I purchased. Never thought I would use it. Now my entire life is run on Alexa LOL My lights my TV my thermostat my stereo system pretty much everything. But it makes things really convenient I don_ know how much my data is now out there to third parties but it_ fun they can do just so much,0
5,"Good ole Alexa
  
",4.Jan.20,Yes,"Setup is quick and easy. You just download the Alexa app on your phone and it will walk you through the process. Sound is decent for one room and the volume goes up pretty high (where you would have to yell over the music). Also, you can pair two echo dots together for more of a stereo surround sound experience. Alexa tends to pick up her name from the tv or a conversation well, but sometimes she won_ pick up my voice unless I get aggressive with her and shout out her name. You can connect it to Apple Music, Spotify, Pandora, Amazon music and other music providers but if you don_ use any of those, it will still play most music through amazon music for free. Also allows you to connect to other household items. Currently I have it hooked up to my smart lightbulbs and smart tv. Now I can turn on/off lights and/or tv without even getting up. Overall a good product to have.",0
5,"Good Voice Recognition, Sound Quality, Setup
  
",4.Jan.20,Yes,"Easy to set up.I have a horrible time getting another popular female voice assistant to understand what I'm saying. Not so with Alexa. She almost always gets me.The sound is great to me, even when playing music.  Admittedly I'm not an audiophile. If you are, your opinion may differ. But for the majority of us, I'm very happy with the sound quality.",0
4,"Recommend if you have other Amazon or Alexa-enabled products
  
",4.Jan.20,Yes,"I really love this item overall. I enjoy being able to control my fire tv stick using my echo dot. However, I have found that it does have trouble hearing me every now and then. Also, the most frustrating thing is that I wish Alexa could answer general questions from the echo dot. For example, she was blinking yellow (I know now that this is a sign that I have a notification) and I asked her why. Instead of answering me, she directed me to the Alexa app on my phone. She does this quite often for any questions I have about her. Other than that, I enjoy the overall appeal of having a little personal assistant on my nightstand that I can ask to turn the lights out, turn my show on, or play music. I would definitely recommend getting this if you have other Amazon or Alexa-enabled products in the house!",0
5,"Upgrade
  
",4.Jan.20,Yes,"I was given the 3rd gen to upgrade my 2nd gen Dot, and the sound quality is much better! Slightly larger than my 2nd gen, but nothing major. The cord does seem to be a bit shorter than my old one, so even though it_ in the same spot, I had to do some finagling to get it there.Setting it up was easy, I didn_ have to reconnect any of my smart plugs.Both dots seem to have some issue with my Southern accent- I have a smart light named Yellow and when I ask to turn it on about 10-25% of the time they think I want to turn on an alarm.If I had any quibble, it_ that the _ink isn_ really pink, it_ more of a red-ish mauve.",0
4,"Good echo, but not.a replacement for an alarm clock.
  
",4.Jan.20,Yes,The only things that I can knock this echo for is that the clock is dim in a well lit room and hard to see and that the main reason for getting this over a regular echo dot was to replace an alarm clock and the alarm on this is not very loud. I have not found a way to adjust the alarm volume yet and increasing the volume does not change  the alarm volume.,0
5,"Amazed!
  
",4.Jan.20,Yes,I love Alexa!  I'm not very tech savvy but it was pretty easy to set up and couldn't be any easier to use.  I'm amazed at everything she does and I've found that she actually helps me save quite a bit of time when I'm getting ready for work in the morning.  She does all the things on command that I used to have to stop to do like checking weather or time checks or even playing my music.  She's also very personable when completing these tasks for me.  My only complaint is that I have to yell at her when I'm playing my music.  The deal I received on this item also made it extremely affordable to check it out to see if this was going to be something I really wanted to try out and I'm so glad I did!,0
5,"Cool Cyber Monday Purchase, Good Quality Speaker/Clock
  
",5.Jan.20,Yes,"I have been wanting to snag a new clock for my night stand. These were on such a good deal during Cyber Monday that I figured ""why not"". I had a first gen Echo Dot and it was pretty lame. First thing I noticed with this 3rd gen Echo with the Clock integration is a noticeable improvement in sound quality over the first-gen unit. The clock itself is a clock - nothing special but it's clear and adapts to the brightness of my room nicely and has a tap to silence alarm option which is nifty in the morning. The sound quality improvement is great - it's not like it'll blow you out of the water but it does a nice job of being a small speaker. I haven't tried pairing Echo Dots yet but I read that I can do stereo and I think that will make a world of difference. Thinking of buying one for my wife for her night stand so that there's a good stereo link in the bedroom for good music listening while getting ready for the day. Even then I don't expect a radical upgrade in sound quality but if I really wanna up the quality game there's evidently a subwoofer you can add to these speakers which would make a world of difference. The speaker gets only somewhat loud in a modest sized room - two would help and with a subwoofer I imagine it would be a formidable stereo sound system strictly for music and podcast listening. The Alexa integration is nice too - makes it useful for a myriad of other things. I wouldn't mind the Echo Dot/Echo Dot Clock being bigger though to allow more better bluetooth audio performance. I think these could be louder and fuller without a subwoofer attachment if they offered a jumbo sized unit. Maybe that's fragmenting the consumer base in Amazon's eyes, I dunno, but I certainy would be interested in that product. Or maybe I should just buy a full size Echo? Only problem is those aren't stereo.",0
5,"Great addition to your Echo ecosystem!
  
",5.Jan.20,Yes,"I am pleasantly surprised with the Echo Dot. Like any Echo devices, it's easy to setup and use. Truly a miniature version of the larger Echo devices. I cannot compare against Gen 1 or 2 but I'd imagine that there are improvements.  If you have other Echo devices, the Dot is a great addition. If this is the only Echo devices that you own, it is equally good.The Dot is perfect for the bedroom, kitchen, basement, family room, or home office.  Literally just about anywhere in your house. Working exactly like larger Echo devices, you can Alexa for a weather forecast, news update, time, play trivia, or interesting facts. The Dot can also be used as a bluetooth speaker. It is certainly not going to be as loud, offer better bass, mids/lows as a full fledged BT speaker or larger Echo but holds its own.TIP:Do you want louder and better sound quality? Pair a bluetooth speaker with the Dot or use connect a speaker using the AUX port located on the back of the Dot.If you have smart plugs, lights or other devices in your house, the Dot can control all of those. Placing the Dot on a night stand,  you can ask Alexa to turn the table lamp on or off. I tested calling with the Echo Dot and it was good. The sound was clear and the person on the other end could clearly hear me. The Dot can stream Apple Music, Spotify, Tune-in, NPR, etc, and pair with another Dot for stereo sound.What this boils down to is that the Dot is a heck of a device for the price! The technology is going to get smarter and better! The debate is out on Google home vs. Amazon Echo. However you may heard that the 3 major smart home device manufacturers are working on a standard. This is good news for consumers.",0
4,"Almost complete improvement
  
",5.Jan.20,Yes,"I own a 2nd gen Echo Dot and bought a 3rd gen about a week ago, here are the comparisons:pros:1) the sound quality is noticeably better. I think people who are griping about the sound quality are those who expect this Echo to play music and fill out an entire large living room. That is an unrealistic expectation. Look at the size of this thing. The sounds are richer and the bass is fuller. It plays music and it sounds great in my master bedroom.2) shape is improved and it feels more quality than the plastic-y feeling of the previous model.3) the set-up was crazy simple. and it was pretty easy to set up the previous model so that's wild.Here is my 1 CON:The 2nd gen Dot connected via micro-USB, which is a pretty simple and universal cord.The 3rd gen, however, uses what seems to be a dedicated cord for Echos only. I do not like that. In the event I need a new cord, I will need to go to Amazon and only Amazon for a replacement. For that, it's 4 stars for an otherwise fantastic product.Maybe I'm being crazy, but I want to put the info out there for you to decide.",0
4,"Works great instead of yelling
  
",5.Jan.20,Yes,"Got this to install in the Master bedroom. Works well to communicate with Echo in kitchen. Now a lot easier to hear what she's saying without yelling. The one thing I do not like is each unit cannot play their own music, only one can be playing. When I was in the kitchen and wanted the echo to play Music, it had to change from bedroom echo to kitchen. And the bedroom echo was turned off. The thing was easy to set up, well somewhat easy. I went to fast and missed a step. I had to go back and start over and this time it went smoothly. For as small as it is, I'd say the sound quality is quite good. Not the Mono you would expect with one speaker. I got these on special with 2 speakers. I plan on putting the other one in the garage so I can be called at meal time. I'll try the music function, but as stated before only 1 echo at a time can play music, and she will want her music in the house. (why the 4 star rating)Guess I'll have to live with the boom box. All in all I think these are great items to help you call the kids or whoever on another floor.",0
4,"A major flaw in an otherwise flawless device
  
",5.Jan.20,Yes,"The 3rd Generation Dot is a minor miracle, and a superb upgrade to Generation 2. Unfortunately it suffers from the same problem, however, as does the 2nd Generation. There is something wrong between the Alexa app and many if not most of the radio stations that Alexa can deliver. I have three echo devices which all suffer from the same problem. Namely an erratic and annoying lack of consistent volume control over the devices. I don't know whether it is Amazon's equipment at fault, or if the radio stations themselves are not compatible with echo devices. It's not a deal breaker, but the problem persists with apparently no one taking notice or trying to fix the flaw, wherever it exists. Otherwise, echo devices play beautifully and are built like a swiss watch.",0
5,"Nice little helper
  
",5.Jan.20,Yes,"I bought this for my vision impaired mother, who is losing her vision to macular degeneration.  I am working with her to use it to operate lighting, entertainment, and life needs.  She uses it mainly to talk on the phone, which has helped her due to it being louder than the phon...she also wears hearing aids.  I programmed it to operate the Harmony Hub, gving her voice operated entertainment across the television.  I am still programming skills into it as I see fit, and as the need pops up.  So far, she's been able to use it easily.Having the larger Echo Gen3, I can say the sound quality is less than the larger device, but still adequate enough for a hearing and sight impared person to hear.",0
5,"Very stylish
  
",5.Jan.20,Yes,"Well i finally got it, since Amazon came out with the third generation Echo Dot with clock, i could not wait to get it. It was delivered in the latter days in December 2019,  this thing is so much more amazing than the 2nd generation one.  The first echo dot really resembled a hockey puck,  this one (3rd), is so much more stylish, goes so well with my decor. I reallly wanted the darker color one with the clock, but so far only the the white with grey cloth has the clock. Anyway I'm very satisfied with this one,  now if you not mindful of the clock, then there's other colors that are simply lovely looking, i do recommend this 3rd generation Echo dot, an upgrade of anything is always better.",0
5,"Not sure I even wanted it to begin with, now it_ an integral part of the home!
  
",5.Jan.20,Yes,Put this in my Christmas wish list almost as an afterthought and was gifted it this Christmas. Started out just using it to play music. I was very impressed with the sound quality from such a small device. Since then I_e added Amazon Music Unlimited so I can listen to all my favorite songs. I_e now added a Logitech Harmony Hub so I can control my TV and other media devices by voice command. I wasn_ real sure I even wanted the Echo Dot to begin with and now I_ already planning all the smart home devices I can add to our home! Getting the one with the LED clock in it for the bedroom as soon as it_ released at the end of February.,0
5,"Great So Far
  
",5.Jan.20,Yes,"I got this as a Christmas present for my mother. While she enjoyed hearing the Christmas music I asked Alexa to play, she unplugged it immediately afterwards.  This was because she had read that folks can hack into it and listen in on conversations.  Now, she plugs it in as needed and unplugs in afterwards.  (She does not trust the microphone on/off switch.)  Forgetting that it was unplugged, I spoke loudly from across the room and the Echo in another room responded!  I enjoy these units but, like anything connected to the internet, I am concerned about security.",0
1,"No longevity
  
",5.Jan.20,Yes,"I have multiple gen 2 echo dots that have been awesome.  I have loved this new updated version until it stopped working correctly.  It works after I unplug it and let it restart but then eventually it stops responding again.  The lights flash but there's no verbal response.  Seems like a software issue to me since it starts working again after being unplugged for awhile but it's frustrating since the previous version worked, and still works, so well.  A great upgrade to the hardware...if it works.  Outside of the warranty window now I guess I'm on my own.  Thanks Amazon",0
3,"Not much of an upgrade
  
",5.Jan.20,Yes,"Upgraded from a Gen Echo Dot.  The sound quality of the Gen 3 is much improved over previous models.  That's about the only positive I have found.  Voice recognition sea about the same.  There is one big negative with this device.  The power cord now uses a proprietary plug for connecting the the device and the cord is only about 4 meters long.  Not quite long enough for placement where the previous echo dot was.  I see this as a hendrance and will be strongly considered when looking to upgrade my other devices. Amazon, you blew it with the power on this one.",0
5,"Really enjoying my echo dots
  
",5.Jan.20,Yes,"My husband just sighs, but he's not the tech person in the house.  I've got news briefings set, am asking about weather and wind chill, doing the question of the day, playing my Sirius music, and doing grocery lists. I got a smart plug for the main living room light yesterday and like that as well. The best thing (for me) is getting my husband out of the basement (fully finished, he's got it made) without having to go to the stairs and yell. So nice to say ""Alexa, tell Ted to come eat"" or ""Alexa, tell Ted to get the dog off the love seat so we can walk her"" or ""Alexa, remind Ted we need to leave in 15 minutes"". Also like the 7 minute workout.",0
5,"Sound quality, WOW!
  
",5.Jan.20,Yes,"This was a Christmas present for our 15 year old. We have the Echo Plus so hook up and usage was super easy. The sound was incredibly surprising!! We got the Plus because we wanted to have better sounds but this little Dot did not disappoint, in fact my dad who is a major music buff got one because he was surprised with the quality of sounds, he said the only thing missing is bass, lol. We absolutely love Alexa. Amazon music is great, the interaction with Alexa is fun, she's become a fun activity when friends are over listening to her jokes, random facts and other humorous things she does.",0
5,"She listens like she hates me.
  
",5.Jan.20,Yes,"I'm not going to give the machine that is fast tracked for global dominance a bad review, she is a lovely machine and is all I could ever want or need in an assistant.  That being said. She doesn't recognize my voice even though I set her up. My speech is very clear and I have no problem communicating with anyone other than my echodot3.  Alexa's voice is rather deep in tone and it makes her hard to understand at times. Other than those two small things my family loves the echo dot 3 and prime music.",0
4,"The instructions need to be far better!!!!
  
",5.Jan.20,Yes,"Bought a new Gen 3 Echo Dot and tried to add it to my list of other Dots.  Well, as seems to be the case these days, the instructions are terse with large areas of blank colors that are devoid of any text, notes or suggestions.  Large areas of white space to the user is of no help!!!!!!  So, as seems to be the norm these days and because of poor instructions, I had to set up a chat with a CSR.  He was really good and was able to solve my problems in about 15 minutes.  Cheers to the Alexa CSR people.",0
2,"Awful
  
",5.Jan.20,Yes,"These are practically useless. The speaker quality is awful - using it as an intercom is pointless because it_ so staticky that I can only hear every few words when trying to communicate through it. We have to repeatedly give commands, and half the time, it doesn_ execute properly. _lexa, no and _top are common phrases when we are using it. Most of the time, I have to really raise my voice for it to hear me.It_ just not user-friendly at all. It_ so much easier to just use your phone.",0
4,"Finding uses for my echo
  
",5.Jan.20,Yes,I really like this product so far. I still have yet to figure out how to sync the new tv with Alexa commands built in but I_ getting used to all the handy things like the intercom system. I no longer have to yell upstairs or downstairs to call the kids or my wife! I went on a date night with my with and I get a call with no caller ID which is unusual. So I answer the call and it was my kids somehow calling my Iphone through  the echo/echo dot and Alexa to tell me goodnight. Gotta love technology!,0
5,"Well I'm Hooked!
  
",5.Jan.20,Yes,"I have been playing with my new Echo Dot for over a week now, and I still have not found out all the things it can do. I have it (her) turning lights on and off, playing music, and a load of other things. I think the array of accessories that it can control will only get bigger. I have found that the Kasa smart plugs provide the most use as they have their own program schedule for automatic operation. I think in the near future, I'll be buying a few more Dots for other locations in my house.",0
4,"Quality product
  
",5.Jan.20,Yes,"For the most part, I like this product. There are several features that it is known for though that you need to pay an additional monthly service fee for. It is also always 'on' and makes random noises sometimes in the middle of the night. We bought this specifically for our bedroom and have not found a solution yet to making the noises stop. Otherwise, just learning to ask your questions in the right way is the only challenge. Good quality product for not a lot of money.",0
4,"I suppose I will get used to another woman in my house
  
",5.Jan.20,Yes,"I really like alexa and plan to eventually  integrate more of my house. right now it is just linked with my firestick and amazon music, my kindle and audible. I will eventually try hooking up some lights and appliances. My wife is jealous of alexa's voice but it sometimes is hard for me to understand. The bass and mid-range overpower the treble and older folks like me need those high pitches more as we get older. I think when Bezos and his crew get older they'll correct the issue but I will probably be dead by then.",0
5,"Echo vs Google Home. I choose Echo.
  
",5.Jan.20,Yes,"While it didn't work with the plugs that not only Amazon said worked, and the plugs said worked, I do still enjoy my Echo. I use both Google home and Amazon Echo, and quite frankly, I'm just going to switch to Echo for my whole-house smartifying/autonomy.I got a Google home because I use YouTube as my main source of music, and Amazon simply doesn't play with Google services. But after having my Echo, I can say that it's far superior. Google home is nice, but rather 'dumb.' Echo has hundreds and hundreds of useful skills... Google has... Zero skills... I don't plan on getting rid of my. Google, simply for the fact I have an android phone and can send info to my phone and such with GH, but all future purchases will be Echo geared.",0
5,"Needs work
  
",5.Jan.20,Yes,"I have three of these in my house already, but I got this one for my 98 year old grandmother. My grandmother is blind and I thought this would be a great tool for her to use. However, the voice recognition for her is less than par. She speaks clear, but slower than most and the Alexa in mid-sentence we'll start doing something before she's giving the Alexa the command. I'm not sure how to remedy this problem. Because it would be a great tool for her and to enjoy.",0
5,"Useful, helpful, educational, entertaining
  
",5.Jan.20,Yes,"Very useful, helpful, educational, entertaining, and a must have for the family and home. To communicate with calls, messaging, drop-ins, or announcements is great no need to pick up the phone. Just speak and it does for you. A skill that is great for parents with children in elementary school is (Spelling Bot) you tell Alexa the words for the week. Then it makes up a spelling test. Your child spells the word to Alexa and tells the child if it was correct or not. It's a fun way for them to practice there spelling words. I could go on and on about the echo dot but to keep it short. I'll just say it is a must have to purchase and set Alexa up the way that will work for you in your everyday life",0
5,"Awesome
  
",5.Jan.20,Yes,We love Alexa. We had a google as well and it did not work well. We had to keep power cycling it. My only complaint about Alexa is that we have one for each of our kids as well as one for our downstairs and when we call for one they all hear the name. We have used the other names that you can call her but with having five Alexis in this house we would like to have a different name for each Alexa and would like to pick our own name. But otherwise she works great For playing music and answering questions with the kids homework when they do not know what definition or how to spell something or setting timers,0
5,"Much better than the Gen 1/2
  
",5.Jan.20,Yes,"Got this new 3rd Gen Echo, wow. Got this free with another purchase. Thought I would give it a try and replace the old Gen 1/2 Kitchen Dot. The sound quality is MUCH better. Depth, quality and volume are much richer and robust.Even better, this one listens and understands WAY better. We were constantly having to repeat commands with the old Dots. This new one is so good, I may replace the other three in my home.",0
5,"Love my Echo Dot
  
",5.Jan.20,Yes,"I didn_ ask specifically for this, it was a gift from my parents when I requested a small speaker for Christmas... BUT I am so glad that my mom chose an Echo Dot for me! I love that it is Alexa enabled because it offers so many hands-free options for music, Fire TV control, recipes, homework questions, etc. I like that connecting to other apps through the Alexa app, like my Apple Music, makes it a pretty diverse speaker too, so I_ not just limited to Prime Music. And for such a little speaker it has great sound output. I_e really enjoyed using it the last couple weeks!",0
5,"Suggestion for howling dog breeds:) and sarcastic human beings:)
  
",5.Jan.20,Yes,"Wish there was away to make Alexa be more of a smartalec - meaning when my husband ask a stupid question/sarcastic question that she gives it back to him:)Also would be nice if she learned Nordic dog speak, or program Alexa to sing the song of their people naturally.  (I have Siberian Huskies and we've been known to have a good 2 to 5 minute howling session. Think row row your boat in tandem. If unsure, Google it, it is a blast a know my munchkins love it.)",0
4,"Am surprised to be pleased!
  
",5.Jan.20,Yes,"Bought this during a special offer, and wasn_ sure what to expect due to the fact that I don_ have huge need for full home automation.  But after buying some smart plugs have found great uses for the echo dot.  Voice recognition and clarity is great.  And for someone who has mostly Apple devices I can say that echo/alexa has much more _peakable knowledgeable base than SIRI(which mostly directs you to a website for detailed info).Very pleased with purchase.",0
5,"Loving our 3 Echo Dots
  
",5.Jan.20,Yes,"This was our 3rd purchase of the Echo Dot. We love it and we discover more and more ways to use it other than music. We just recently hooked up our free account with Pandora and now we can play music from Pandora. I was finding I could not  play some of the artists I wanted to listen to unless I bought Amazon Unlimited music. But I can play with Pandora. Easy to switch back and forth by telling Alexa to play Pandora or Alexa!  I also discovered that I could listen to Fox News! I was totally surprised. Now in one room someone can listen to Fox or whatever news they want, while another person can listen to music in another room.  We also use Alexa for grocery lists, reminders and if you purchase something from Amazon, you can notifications  from Alexa!  We have the app on our phones, tablets and computer!  We love it!!",0
5,"My opinion of the Echo Dot 3 (3rd Generation)
  
",5.Jan.20,Yes,"I did receive the Echo Dot 3, thank you.  I must say I have lots of reading - (learning) to do.  However, the volume of the Echo Dot 3 in my bedroom is not as clear as the Echho Dot Show (meaning the small television) in my living room. I realize I need to do my reading with the paperback book I already purchased.  Thank you for understanding the way I described it!!",0
5,"Stage one complete
  
",5.Jan.20,Yes,"Ok so I can't afford the whole smart home kit so I'm starting off piece by piece.  And plus got a deal on two echo dots.  So we are in the trial stage with Alexa.  Loving it so far I like j6 and alexa answers a lot of questions. Always asking what time is it.  Kids love it.  My 7 yo asks so many questions, now I'm like ask Alexa and she goes to town.  She stumped Alexa on 20 questions on the first try! Anyway might get a camera or smart plug next.",0
4,"Disconnects from WiFi
  
",5.Jan.20,Yes,"I initially loved this Dot, but this pasty week its been disconnecting from the WiFi or not following through with some commands (Alexa play Disney music, etc.)I have one of the original Dots and that one works fine and never disconnects from the WiFi, unless our internet is down.I like the plum color. And my kids love calling me when I_ away by using Alexa.",0
5,"My household helper!
  
",5.Jan.20,Yes,"I use my Echo to turn on my smart bulbs, play music and play relaxation sounds while I sleep. I love the use of the smart bulbs. I live in a very old house and my stairwell only had a switch at the top. Now I can turn off that light after I_ safely downstairs. I use my echo for a lot of other trivial things as well like grocery lusts, etc.",0
3,"Nice sound. Makes a good speaker.
  
",5.Jan.20,Yes,"I really thought I would enjoy Alexa more than I do. I especially love to use Alexa to play music from my cell phone. Half the time, she won't even play the playlist I tell her to. I end up repeating 3 to 4 times and she plays something totally off the wall.  Maybe I need to work with it some more. I'll keep trying.",0
4,"Fix household issue
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,"Bought this as a gift for my daughter for Christmas. She absolutely LOVES it. I doubt it has gotten much rest since she opened it. We laugh because we have heard ""Alexa"" 24586544 times, for everything from the weather to adjusting the playback sound-as if she has always had an assistant to do everything for her __The drawback I've found with it is that when you have an Amazon Household Account and both accounts have ordered Amazon devices both accounts have complete access to every device. Also if you make an announcement or reminder instead of just playing on your device it announces to all devices. I wish that even though we share a household, we don't want complete control of each other's devices. If there were a way to keep each device's access linked solely to the account it was offered from this would be OUTSTANDING! The only 'fix' Amazon CSR was able to offer was to drop the household-essentially even though we live together we'd still have to pay for 2 Prime accounts to keep the devices separate.Figure out how to keep a household and not have access to all devices and this would definitely be a 5 star review.",0
5,"Don_ hesitate. Get one!
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,"I_e been one of those people who held off integrating Alexa into my life. You read all the stories about how it listens to your every word and records some conversations even. Well your cellphone does the same thing. I was given a dot for Christmas and decided to set it up in my office where about the only thing she could record is me editing a video or me listening to YouTube. I got two smart plugs with my gift so I hooked up my living room light to it and tested it out. I was pleasantly surprised how easy it was. Well then things spiraled and I needed to be able to control everything with Alexa. She turns on my tv and plays whatever I tell her to. This has been a huge help with having a newborn. While I_ feeding, changing or burping I can tell Alexa to set timers or pull up my favorite tv show. Next up is a ring doorbell. Alexa can listen to me farting and yelling at the dogs all she wants as long as she keeps making my life easy.",0
5,"Amazing little speaker! and a new little assistant.
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,"What I like about this device is:1) I can make calls over it2) I can listen to music over it (wish it did google music but  I knew it didn't and okay with that)3) I can set timers, great in the kitchen4) I can set up routines to wake me up, turn on the lights after a short wait, and then play a song or two.5) I can lay in bed and say ""Computer Next song""  or ""Compter Play some soft jazz""  (I changed it so it answers to Computer. and the other one in the house is Alexia!The sound quality is pretty good for the size, sometimes I have to get closer if the music is too loud to turn it down.All in all I think this was a good purchase, I just wish they would have google play music available as a skill.You can pair the speaker up to play as a blue tooth speaker for your phone too.It controls lights, just be sure to get the right Bluetooth enabled bulbs.",0
4,"Wouldn't want to live without!
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,"I'm a gadget person who avoided trying this out because I didn't think I would use it enough or that it would be anything more than a speaker or be more painful to setup &amp; operate than its worth.  Boy was I wrong!! I use it every day now &amp; would hate having to go without it. Love being able to just ask for music, info on different subjects, add items to different lists, get news headlines, read my email, call people all hands free while doing something else. A multitasker's dream gadget!Highlights: * Easy setup for routines, skills etc through the Alexa App.* Easily links with other media app accounts.* Performs quickly &amp; immediately things that would take allot more time for me to do like making a list, item inquiry, info look up, set alarms, even play music etc* Sound quality for music is better than expected. Speech could have more clarity though.* Price point is greatCons: Haven't found one yet.This gadget is so handy and easy to use that I'm getting my 78yr old hates gadgets Mother one because I know she will be as surprised &amp; happy with it as I am.  Not to mention the safety feature for her to call for help with only her voice if needed, is a definite plus.",0
5,"It_ good for the money.
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,"I listen to music in the shower with this doohickey.  It_ held up very well.  I can get my morning news brief in the morning and listen to my morning mix while I get ready.  The sound is very improved from the dot 2.  I was running that with an anchor sound core 2.  This is comparable, but not quite as good.  Good enough that I retired the Bluetooth speaker to travel trips though.  This is a cleaner setup.  The audio is by no means good though, but if you_e okay with a cheap Bluetooth speaker, this is on par.  It_ enough for a bathroom.  If the room gets any bigger, you should get one of the larger speakers if you listen to music on it.  I did one of the 8 shows in the kitchen for recipes and music and the audio is night and day.",0
5,"It'a Echo
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,"I have had the Alexa 3rd gen echo, at first I didn't use it much and then got the dot for my upstairs and I find i'm using both now and bought a 3rd. So now I have them in the locations I want and during the warmer months have one to use outside. It does make life simpler with basically everything you want using Alexa . I listen to my tunes while tending to my many fish tanks, place and order hands free if I need something, get my local weather and more. Use the sleep sounds at night and fine I fall a sleep faster and stay a sleep longer. Can drop in on various people and more. I like having them around, but I still mute the mic, besides that I enjoy having them.",0
3,"It was better than I expected.
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,"This was a second Amazon Echo for me. This time I purchased the Dot for my office at a great Black Friday Sale. The sound is amazing. The downfall for me was I thought like my Echo I could move it around the house not being plugged in but you can't, it just turns off. Also I thought I would be able to play separate music while my husband was exercising in another room playing music with the Echo. It wouldn't let me saying for $15.00 a month I can play separate music or link same music that my husband was listening to. So that was very disappointing. Now I just can't do it the same time he is using it.",0
5,"Works great with Apple Music subscription.
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,"I was surprised at how easily it interfaced to my Apple Music account. I actually use it as a bridge between my Apple Music stream and my stereo and it sounds and works great.  I don_ use the built in speaker so I can_ comment on how that sounds.The speech recognition works pretty well.  It sometimes misunderstands and plays random music but most of the time it gets it right.  I love that I could change the name it responds to from Alexa to computer, and give her a great British accent. Brings a bit of Star Trek to the living room.  I wish I could name it Hal with a deep sultry voice.  Many next year.",0
5,"Amazing device, packed full of functionality.
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,"The functionality of this device is pretty amazing.  The attention to detail and customization when setting up the blueprints is really amazing.  I currently have them throughout the place and I can_ express enough how much I really do enjoy them.  Tons of features that are helpful and well thought out. Guest blueprints, chores, babysitter feature and even workout sessions fully customizable.  Setting up the play music every where feature was very easy and comes in handy when you have those clean the house days.  No matter what room you walk into it_ nice to hear the same song or audible book you were just listening to in the previous room.  It truly is a wonderful product.  I am very happy with this purchase.",0
5,"What a great device!
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,"I love my Echo Dot! Alexa is my new friend. LOL I'm enjoying finding out all it can do. Its a ton of fun asking Alexa questions. I downloaded the Alexa app to my iPad &amp; it went off without a hitch. Installing the Alexa app to my desktop computer was a bit more fiddly. Mainly due to my fiddling with settings a long time ago. Got Alexa working just great now. I bought one of your smart plugs so I'm having even more fun! LOL For what you get with Alexa, the price is fantastic! If you don't mind I have to go, Alexa is playing Mozart. LOL",0
1,"horrible voice
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,I couldn't understand a word alexa was saying. I can't believe you haven't figured out I sent it back less than a week after I got it. I even tried calling customer service and the had me listen to music and it was okay but the regular voice I couldn't understand at all. My son has the same problem with his but he turns his on high volume and is okay with it even though he can't possibly be happy. Go back to the drawing board on this thing and give it options for different voices. So I hated mine to be honest so back it went.,0
5,"Who needs a girlfriend when you have alexa
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,Should be 1 star because she wont marry me until mars is colonized..... but i'll overlook that.Connects fine considering i have sattelite internet i didn't think it would work.It's good for entertianing kids  my friends kid loves the are you smarter than a 5th grader app and the animal workout app.I had no idea there were so many apps for this thing.I also have it turning on lights and adjusting my temp. It can turn on my dish dvr (but not the tv so that's kind of pointless).....&gt;,0
4,"Great device and work well! I just wish I could turn it off!
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,"I hope this helps someone who is concerned about the same issue I am and that is echo not have the ability to be turned off. I appreciate the option to mute the mic, but do not like eat red light on all night, especially in a very dark room like the bedroom when sleeping. Also, unplugging it each night as a turn-off option is not very functional, especially if you plan to use it for alarms to early morning activities. So here is my creative solution, so feel free to use it. I plugged my echo into a wifi smart plug that I have setup on timer to turn-off at my bedtime and turn-on before I arise in the morning. That way, I can start the day with giving Alexa commands and not feel as though she is listening to everything that I do throughout the night. :-) This appears to be the best solution for me right now until Amazon comes up with an option to turn the device on and off. If anyone else has any ideas, I would love to hear them. Keep in mind this is more about privacy during quite hours than anything else, so keep that in mind if you decide to comment. Thanks!",0
2,"Echo dot did not listen as well as the Echo Input we have.
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,"I gave this Echo Dot to my wife as a Christmas present. I also gave my 12 year old an Echo Input to connect to his pre-existing speaker. The Input hears us from 2 or 3 rooms away and sometimes with doors closed (that may be a bad thing for some people, but we use the mute button if we don't want it to listen in). The Dot only hears us in the same room, and when the music is on, we have to yell a few times for it to respond. The Input hears us perfectly even when the music is on max volume. Maybe there's a problem with the Dot unit we received and it may not be a product-wide issue, but I am returning this. I'm not sure that my wife will get another Echo device. If she does she said it would be an Echo Input.",0
4,"Pretty Awesome! Just a small bug.
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,"Alexa is so fun to mess with, her sarcastic remarks and jokes are funny! For it to be a small speaker, she sure does project, very well. I really like the multi-room music function, where you can play the same song on multiple Alexas in the household, it makes chores more fun. Small problem though, sometimes the music will just stop, or if we're in the middle of a game with her, sometimes she'll just turn off. We don't ever have connection issues, so I'm not sure what else it could be. If that was fixed, it would be a full 5 stars. We haven't encountered any huge problems with her. In the future, a wireless charching dock would be cool, in case if have to take her to another room temporarily. :)",0
5,"PERFECT!!
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,"It was nice addition to the home, difficulty setting up with my daughter doing the same in another room but once I was set up it was great. I am currently having difficulty getting Alexa to do anything other than play my alarms and music I never asked for when the alarms go off and that's been for  2 days &amp; 7 alarms now, I will look more into it while at work today and hopefully would have rectified the situation before 4AM tomorrow because if not Alexa will be thrown out of the window.",0
4,"Fun unexpected gift!
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,"My kids absolutely love the Echo!  We got two for Christmas and we have been having a lot of fun. Listening to music is easy and will pull from Amazon Music or Apple Music depending on what we ask for.  The sound quality is excellent. We have requested the time, weather, jokes, information, phone numbers, and to make lists. Alexa tells pretty good jokes and my kids laugh like crazy and then repeat them to everyone.  We are still finding new things that we can do. Fun and convenient. I would definitely recommend this.",0
5,"Cute and functional device!
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,"My son bought the Echo Dot for me for Christmas - its cute. Easy to set up and easy to use. I ask about the weather, I ask it to play Gospel, Jazz, Christmas Music, and Meditation music. No problems with Echo getting to those genres. However, the playlist? hmmmm not really crazy about it but it works for my needs. It plays the game Akinator ----- LOL!! My son told me about it so I downloaded the app and played a few times -hilarious how this device knows what I'm thinking. Pretty fun!",0
4,"Has it_ flaws but worth the purchase.
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,"The product is worth the money when it works. So far, I_ constantly pairing it to the internet. The speaker cannot handle any song with base in it. Scheduling lights on or off works half the time. I enjoy having a MP3 player on call and voice commands suck as Alexa, turn on tv. I think they should continue to improve and eventually the product will get there. I_e bought two for two rooms in the last two weeks, even with the aggravation, it_ a good product. I give it a B overall, with room for improvement.",0
5,"I call ""her"" Echo.
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,"My dog's name is Lexi.  I call my Echo Dot, ""Echo"" to avoid ""waking"" ""her"" whenever I talk to my dog.  I wake in the mornings and tell Echo, Good Morning.  She always responds pleasantly and tells me something positive to start my day.  Throughout the day, I ask her to set timers and reminders (which she does).  She plays music for me.  She tells me jokes.  I even tell her good night and she sends me off to bed with a pleasant remark.  I received her as a Christmas gift.  I'm very happy with my new Echo Dot.",0
1,"We want to change the female voice to a male voice
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,"I wish I could change that stupid female robot voice to a male robot as we can do on Google assistant . I don't care about having a "" star"" to talk to me and spacially don't care to have to pay extra for it, I think nowadays we should be able to change the voice of our assistant freely. That what I love with Google's assistant we can change the voice to our likes. I was on the market for other Alexa gadgets but I'm going to pass on it for now.",0
5,"Unbelievable little speaker
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,"You can't imagine how loud is this speaker even when the volume is 60% the people from outside my apartment can hear the sound, add to tha the quality of the sound and the base are so great and Alexa response make it even better.I would recommend it, you can use Bluetooth or Wi-Fi to play songs, unfortunately it needs the wire attached all the time but still the features of the device cover everything and will make you 100% satisfied.",0
5,"Good device for the price.
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,"The sound quality is not as great for a speaker but the voice recognition is good. Alexa seems to misunderstand some prompts but I am hopeful this will work out the more interaction that occurs. The user friendliness of the device would not be ideal for everyone, I.e. people who aren_ comfortable/tech-savvy (if you will). For example setting it up with the app and other dots in the home would present a challenge and/or frustration for some users thus resulting in not being able to utilize some of the more awesome features of this device. The features are very user friendly once the initial setup (which even for a technically somewhat savvy person took several tries and hours to get correct).",0
4,"A nice home feature at a very reasonable price
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,"We rated the Echo Dot as a 4-star item only because we have not yet fully explored its possibilities enough to be able to give it a 5-star rating knowledgeably.  However, for a very modest price, we have found the Dot to be a useful, though not essential item, to have in our home.  ""She"" answers questions for us about the weather conditions in our vacation home in Northern New England readily, provides updates on current local weather conditions and road conditions and, of most interest during the past Christmas season, she played seasonal music for us readily upon request.  In fact, we liked the latter feature so well that we signed up for a free 30-day music trial with Amazon Music and will likely continue this feature for the modest monthly cost ($3.99/mo.).  We are amazed at how quickly the Dot can find and play countless numbers of tunes for us and readily provide background music in our home when we entertain or just want to hear certain music ourselves.  We don't ""need"" the Echo Dot, but at the price we very much enjoy having it!",0
5,"I love this device
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,"This is my 1st time having a device like this.  In the past month, I have now purchased 3 of them for me and 2 as gifts.  I have one on each floor and I just tell Alexa to play a certain station or ask other things.  I mostly use it for listening to my Penguins Hockey games, so much easier than using my phone and phone speaker all the time to listen to the games, helps to save my phone's battery also.",0
5,"Easy
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,"Walk into room and tell Alexa what to play walk out and say off, that_ it. Going from a Bose sound dock there is no more playing around connecting phone and selecting what to play or adjusting volume, no more. Voice recognition is spot on and easy to use. Only downfall would be this beautiful little speaker will never produce the same sound as the Bose its ok the features out way this shortcoming.",0
2,"Does not live up to expectations
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,She does not understand a lot of  commands and does not have answers to as many questionsas I thought she would. When told to play a song I don't like that she only plays that one song and then stops. I would like her to continue playing music of the same genre. Also I pay for YouTube music and I am upset that Alexa does not sync with YouTube. Now I have to pay for Amazon music in addition to my amazon prime and YouTube. The echo dot is definitely not as great as I was expecting,0
4,"easy to set up, use, and helpful
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,"Bought a bunch of these as presents this year (hint wait for black friday/cyber Monday deals!) everyone liked them.  Had to help set up a few myself, but really easy. Gave it 4 stars as you have to download a bunch of 'skills' before you can ask certain questions, like border line ups (my mom always wants to know!).  So if buying for someone not super tech savvy, help them set up and  send a list of skills they might like.",0
5,"Accurate, Our Lives Have Changed
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,"So I got this as a gift over the holidays. This is not a product I would have ever thought of purchasing myself, however, now that we own one, our lives will never be the same without one. They should have Alexa's EVERYWHERE. The simplicity of a voice comand and the echo dot accuratly responding and or playing the correct song as well as creating playlist all by voice is awesome. I have also paired my Pandora account so it will also play my playlist off of there. For the price, you're getting a better sounding product that an expensive pill shaped speaker.",0
4,"Lots of Fun and Help!
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,"We_e enjoying the music especially, getting the weather and the family gets a kick out of asking Alexa jokes. We_l try  different things as we get the time. We have two Echo Dots and got them both going, we thought, but need to figure out why the one in hubby_ workshop here at the house isn_ working. Probably some little, simple glitch.  We_e happy to have Alexa here with us! _",0
5,"Love how we have so many devices connected, how you can play games w/Alexa or for info/music etc
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,"Everything is good, we have 2 of these Alexa echo dot units then an Amazon show 8 and also an Amazon Alexa Echo the tall one so we have them in different areas of the house and all connected so we can talk to each other thru them and have each one do different things at the same time. We originally had/have a Google home so we do like the different types of things both do but as of right now the Alexas are great to use all through the house (we even have one of the dots in the bathroom so we can listen to music or other options while in the shower and can even drop in while someone is in there so it's got great features all together and we've only scratched the surface of what this all can do! Very neat to have this ""set"", I love all the cool features on the Amazon Show 8 which can be set up to do things on the Dots and Echo!",0
5,"My little friend
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,This little thing is awesome. I love this gave it to my hubsand as christmas gift.  He loves it too.  Every morning he get updates on news and weather. Set alarms to wake him up for work.  Plays songs on request including indian music thst is awesome. I cant sleep without the deep sleep music. Me and my hubsand love alexa. I am suprised with the volume frequency its is great for a small device.,0
4,"THIS DEVICE IS HELPFUL! BUT AT WHAT COST?!
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,"Quite honestly at first and still at times I find it quite creepy. The rate that AI has taken off lately. After the first week or so of having this product I've had fun integrating it into my life. I've found it quite useful for things such as turning out smart bulbs or even using it to change the channel on my roku.The fact that you could use this for such things as games, telling the time or temperature, setting schedule or timers and even therapy. This device can essentially do everything a zombie drone human attached to their phones could do. But even better, cheaper and at times more helpful.If the future turns into that Will Smith movie I-Robot, I won't be entirely too shocked. This device is helpful now. But imagine what it will be in a decade from now.",0
5,"Better sound than the previous generations.
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,"Unit seems to have more bass in the output, and the program equalizer does not remove enough bass for some folks. Wife has a hearing deficit in certain tonal ranges that made hearing the unit hard for her, Switched the unit to a different location partially solved the problem. Would purchase again, sounds great to me, but they are larger that the previous generations.",0
4,"Its very useful
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,"I received the Echo Dot as a white elephant Christmas exchange. I'm very happy with it. However, it does take some getting used to. It does not always know how to respond and I have to figure out exactly what to say in order for certain things to happen. She has also just stopped in mid stream sometimes when performing certain tasks. I do recommend it because I find it useful. It connects with You Version Bible and reads the plans and also Audible.",0
5,"Great for my office!
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,"As a therapist who does hypnosis and meditation with my patients, Echo Dot is a welcome part of my practice. We use Amazon music Family Plan to play exactly what we need, when we need it. We now have 3 in our office. I purchased the holder for it that plugs in the wall and wire is out of the way.Fabulous. We also have 3 Echo Dots at home.",0
2,"Get it if you want it, I_ not impressed
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,"The AI goes on and off every now and then. (Makes me paranoid, lol)I purchased the echo as a combo with the nest thermostat. _ I think I need a hub so that I can change the settings via speech.Anyway, I personally don_ need AI unless it_ a fully functioning robot. Echo and Google home has just been AI paper weights.",0
1,"Great sounding and that_ about it
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,"Unplugged it after a week.  Only plays songs like the song I request, not the requested song.  It seems many have this problem.  Was disappointed cause it does sound great.  Makes a great paperweight though.  I have the first version dot and for some reason everything i tried to switch my membership to new dot didnt work.",0
5,"Replaced my old alarm clock
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,"When my original bedside alarm died after 30 years, I bought one from a reputable name.  However, controls were difficult and not intuitive and the dial brightness, even on low, could wake me up from a sound sleep.  Some nights I_ turn it over on its face to rid myself of the annoyingly bright bluish green light, which defeated the purpose of a bedside clock.  So when Amazon released a version of the Echo with an embedded clock, I decided to make a change.  It took the place of a Gen 1 Echo Dot.  It provides all the features I want in a bedside alarm clock except a spare USB port to recharge my phone while I sleep.Anyone that has used Alexa to set alarm times knows its a pretty simple command, including naming multiple alarms.  Countdown timers appear on the face to temporarily replace the clock dial, which replaces the often repeated phrase _lexa, how much time left.  A phrase I_ glad to left go of.  The clock face automatically brightens with increased ambient light and then dims again when the lights go out. Since I need Alexa to run smart home routines as I prepare for bed anyway, it has been a perfect solution.  The only criticism is that it doesn_ come in alternate colors such as grey or black.Bruce",0
4,"Works as advertised and intended
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,"The Echo Dot is a shorter more compact version of the original Alexa.  It integrated into my home network with no difficulty or problems.  I already have two tall Alexa devices and since this Dot was within voice distance of one of the other Alexaes I just had to change the default name from Echo to another name.  I use this Echo Dot in the garage so that I can stream radio from the internet while I am out there.  It works as intended, but since I have it sitting flat with the base against the wall, I find that I have to be relatively close (within five feet) for it to understand my voice directions.  I'm not sure if this is caused because of the way I have it situated or because the sound receptors are now basically facing up and down rather than left and right, or that the Dot was designed this way.  Whatever the reason it does work and does what I purchased it to do.",0
5,"I just Love it!
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,"Love it! I got two from two different people ,for Christmas. I can_ tell you how much I love it! I will certainly buy more Alexa enabled devices. The echo dot does so many things! It Turns things on and off, acts as a Bluetooth  speaker, It sets alarms,reminders and timers . I think babysitter mode is amazing!Oh the schedules that it keeps, the music it plays, the stories it reads!What can_ it do? I spend a lot time playing with it, to see its features. There are sooo many cool features. It makes phone calls I love the night and morning mode feature... Ugh to much good stuff to talk about.Set up was easy, took about 5 mins .It_ very compact it_ about the Circumference of a coaster.The speaker is surprisingly loudBuy it, play around with it, you_l be amazed how much this little speaker can do.",0
5,"Great quality and price !
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,"We traveled to a vacation home where there is no wi-fi.  I forgot my alexa devices .  I think I have all of them Except for the dot. I realized how much I depend on Alexa for kitchen timers, shopping list, sleep music etc.  Even my husband tells alexa to add something to the shopping list and there it is on my phone !  No need for pen and paper. I didn_ want to use a lot of cellular data from our phone hotspots so I purchased this instead of a spot or a show.  I was not expecting the quality to be as good as all the other devices .  I was pleasantly surprised at the sound quality for what we use it for. Price was great as well .  If you use an alexa device you will grow dependent on it once you get used  to it.  When paired with the alexa app it_ amazing what you can do.  Just love it.",0
5,"I would like to think i'm fairly intelligent, but sometimes, IT JUST AIN'T SO..........LOL
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,"Had a 2nd gen all good. Got a great deal on 3rd gen dot with 2 smart lights. One bulb arrived damaged, no big deal, AMAZON gladly sent me 2 new bulbs (and told me to keep the one that was working) everything was just plug and play could not have been easier. somehow i lost wifi to my computer could not get ALEXA to reconnect spoke with cust serv and they couldn't be more patient with me., but i really didn't want ALEXA to run through my phone. so they offered to replace her. I finally broke don and downloaded the android app had everything back up and running in miniutes and it actually makes everything so much easier. anyway THANKS GUYS YOUR ALL VERY GOOD AT WHAT YOU DO. maybe i'm getting old and stubborn. ALL IN ALL 3RD GEN IS DEFINATELY A BIG JUMP FOWARD I LOVE IT",0
4,"Amazing Speaker
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,"You can't beat the bang for the buck with the speaker! Alexa has paired with pretty much everything in my house, so I control everything from this tiny little box. It has a lot of sound for music, but my favorite part is how it connects with my FireStick. I sit in bed at night, warm under the covers, and yell at Alexa to play my favorite shows! She never complains about being my personal remote. When my phone rings, I yell at her to pause, then replay when I come back in. It's amazing. I don't think I've used my remote in weeks.The only reason it isn't getting 5 stars is because Alexa does get confused a bit. For example, she can't recognize certain TV show names when they have punctuation in them. So that's when I have to manually use my remote control which feels almost archaic at this point! Overall A- quality!!",0
5,"Pretty Cool Tech
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,"I realize that by phrasing the headline the way I did, it might lead one to believe that I've just emerged from under my rock.  But this is not entirely true.  Our family had resisted making a purchase of this type of ""smart"" device for several years for various reasons, but this past Christmas I went whole hog and bought two for our home.  While we don't have anything ""home"" related interfaced with Alexa, it's just super cool to be able to request a song or the weather forecast, and BAM!, there it is.As far as sound quality goes, I will say that it's lacking behind the Anker bluetooth speaker I have, which is probably close in size.  But considering that my Anker is just a speaker, I guess that makes sense.",0
3,"First smart item I have owned
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,"I guess I expected more from this item after I heard someone interact with their Google mini.  The echo doesn't always answer.  You have to know how to interact with it to get it to work as Alexa doesn't always respond if you don't use the right words.  Sometimes there is a tinny noise when she speaks.  Initially when I started using it, you could make phone calls with it and I was told that my voice was very clear and that has ended.  I like that we receive emails suggesting trying different options to interact.  (However, now it seems all the options are the same suggestions.)  Other than that, I like playing games on it.  I like that she can be used as a reminder and alarm.  I especially like that she will read me my kindle books.  Audible was awesome when I trialed it.  I may get it again but they charge too much for the service and I would like that option to be useful in my car as well.",0
4,"Neat Little Device
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,"I haven't been using it as much as I anticipated; maybe 3 or 4 times a week.I Mean - - - - - - - - how many times can you ask it what time it is; whats the weather; tell me a joke; or play music?!?I'm sure it will grow on me eventually; but there are times when the blue/green ring is spinningand I didn't even say the magic word ""Alexa"".These devices are taking random sound samples from your room; for what ever reason, and I'm not really liking it.I use the mute button on top of the DOT at least one a day because I'm not actually sure if it is building some kind of virtual speech data base on me..",0
5,"What an Experience.
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,"I tell you, I wasn't sure how Echo Dot would fair. But I'm very impressed. More so, Alexa. And its capabilities. The Dots volume when compared to Google Home. But of course, that's really not a fair comparison, hah.- It's pretty much on par with the Google Home Mini. I do think the Dot has a bit more ""umph"" than the Home Mini.The microphones are really good. Better than both the Google Home and Home Mini. And the design is much more appealing to look at than the Home Mini. Something satisfying to see the now iconic Alexa blue ring in action as it's responding to you.Overall really happy with the Echo Dot. I wanted to give it a try, being a G. Home user. The Skill features are great! Expanding the horizons of the capabilities. Something Google lacks for its smart home speakers/devices. Not to mention Alexa in general, is more efficient and more polished comparably speaking. - in regards to the app. A very easygoing experience. And just makes sense.Happy with the product!",0
5,"I recommend this product to everybody
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,"Still learning what this echo dot can do but I_ having trouble connecting it to my 4K firestick, I_ hoping once I get further along with this product I can enjoy it more  and give a better update. But I can tell you that I am thoroughly enjoying figuring everything out  And I love the music quality very much. I also got a smart plug and I highly recommend that to go along with this echo dot . I actually ordered the newest echo dot that displays the time on it but  it will not be here until March 2 at the earliest so when I get that one I will be giving this to my mother and teaching her how to get involved in the 21st-century  LOL!I do highly recommend this though and I think you will enjoy it.Will update my  review at a later date. As I stated above I am having difficulty getting this connected to my fire stick which is causing some issues as well as not getting it connected to my cell phone.  I just  need to set aside time to talk to suport and get my issues resolved. Because this is ( so far) the only disappointing issues I_ having .",0
2,"Convenience is Declining
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,"I have owned multiple Echos for about 3 years now. They have been so convenient and amazingly helpful, up until about 4-5ish months ago. I'm not sure if there was a software update or what, but suddenly she became very uncooperative, especially with Fire TV. We used to say ""Alexa, play The Office"" and she would reply with ""Here's The Office from Netflix"". Now if we try to say that to her, she says ""I'm sorry, I don't know that"". Then we thought we needed to say ""Alexa, play The Office on Fire TV"", then she would reply with ""Getting The Office on Fire TV"" and she would pull up a listing on Fire TV with options to play. So then we would have to scroll to Netflix and hit the play button. But before doing that, we have to select the profile on Netflix that we want it to play on. We have slowly figured out that you have to say ""Alexa, turn on The Office on Netflix"" and she will play. But she will not do this for HULU or Disney+. Now, to make matters even worse: while watching a show on Netflix/HULU/Disney+, we used to simply say ""Alexa, pause"" and she would pause the show. Now, she gives the same reply of ""I don't know that"" or ""Hmmm I'm not sure"". Why? W h y ? W H Y ? ? ? We have figured out that we have to say ""Alexa, pause Netflix"" or ""Alexa, fastforward Netflix 1 minute"" Want to skip an episode? FORGET IT SHE DOESN'T KNOW THAT. Want to skip intro? FORGET IT SHE DOESN'T KNOW THAT. This defeats the purpose of having the Fire TV integration. It should be as simple as saying ""pause"" or ""turn on The Office"" or ""fastforward 10 seconds"" We should be able to say ""Alexa, play The Office"" and she should select the most convenient way to play The Office (either from AI knowledge or from recognizing our habits) and then just play it. Like she used to. This is the worst version of Alexa there has been. I have had nothing negative to say about the Echo up until this update. It is actually more frustrating to have an Echo now than it is to not have it. Because I can't just simply give commands anymore and her think on her own and know what to do. I have to think about how she needs me to say things and try different ways of saying things and break it down to very specific instructions and it is no longer a convenience; it is an inconvenience.",0
5,"Love it!
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,"My wife bought me this for Christmas. It's great, the speaker is so much better than past versions. In fact, we have a smart speaker hooked up to another echo in our bathroom, and when I play music on both at the same time, the sound that comes from this little dot is so much better than the bigger speaker.I love the clock. It's a little small (I'm nearsighted) and I have to squint to read it at night, but it's great otherwise. Dims when I turn off the light - nice touch Amazon!They might be spying on me, but I love the Echos we have!",0
5,"This is the best Echo Dot! Love it.
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,"I bought this new Echo Dot with the digital clock on it to replace my generation one echo dot  basically because of the clock on it. That was by far the best move by Amazon and the sound quality is very good.  When asking Alexa the temperature outside, she also displays the temperature  and when you ask here to turn  the volume to a number, that shows too. I noticed there_ been some comments on how to make the display brighter. You have to go into your Alexa app and go to your device and you can set the brightness through that feature in the display feature. Now that I have a clock on this Echo Dot, I use it for an alarm now. Also takes up little space on the nightstand and looks great. I_ very pleased with this product.",0
4,"2 Dots gets Stereo but poor sound quality
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,"Echo 1st generation  up and died displaying the blue ring of death. Black Friday sale had $22 Dots so I bought 2 in order to get stereo sound.  PLUS = I was able to mount Dots on opposite sides of room to get stereo sound. MINUS = the sound quality is poor, muffled. Only one Dot responds, they aren_ sync_ together for basic commands. Stereo has to be set up in the app and I have difficulties getting music in stereo using voice command, I need to go into the app and select it. There should be a default preference setting but I haven_ discovered it yet.",0
3,"Make sure your WiFi signal is strong
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,"I use my speaker mainly to play music. I don_ really receive calls or anything so I don_ need it for much besides music, weather, notifications. It_ nice to be able to check the weather while I_ getting ready for work. The music aspect is fine - if your wifi isn_ the best, you_l definitely notice a lot of buffering in your music like I have. Most of the time it_ great but if too many people in my house are using the WiFi, you can hear my speaker struggle :( Also! I_ the only person on my account, the only one connected to my speaker, but while I was about 40 miles away at work, my sister sent me a video of Alexa playing my music. I_e made sure to disconnect her when I_ not home but that_ just odd.",0
4,"Almost a great product!
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,"It's very convenient and works fantastic. It's able to answer nearly anything when asked. Whispering sounds creepy but I did get a laugh out of it.My problem is that Amazon took away the option to completely disable the listening feature on its latest (3rd gen) devices. With my Amazon Tap, I set it up so that I press a physical button to communicate with the device.However, it DOES have a physical button to mute the microphone.Another issue is that I will have to purchase more (I've purchased two so far) Dots for music around the house and garage. I intended to use my Tap as the main device and use the Dots as satellites.  Amazon apparently won't allow it.  I'm unable to pair the Tap with the Dots. I'm sure a simple OTA software update would fix this feature",0
5,"Easy to setup and getting smarter
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,"I don't have much to add concerning the Echo devices.  We have several. But, Alexa is getting better.  Used to be, if you started a timer with one echo, you had to remember which one it was in order to stop it prematurely or quiet the alarm.  Now all the echoes know about the timer and the timer can be dealt with at any of our echoes.  I actually got this one for my office at work and it was easy to set it up for our work Wifi.  The 3rd gen echo dot has much better audio quality than the 2nd gen dot, though not as good as the full size echo.",0
2,"Not better than the Google home mini
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,"So the google home mini beats the echo dot in my opinion by a long shot. This is good only to integrate with Amazon's website but with google home mini you have everything alexa has but add the search engine capabilities and syncs with google calendar, reminders and alarms also can track flights prices for certain travel periods and send them to your email. The alexa is okay but compared to the google home mini it just doesnt stand a chance. Also I got two light bulbs for the same price as alexa from kholes hence Alexa went back and google home mini rules my house.",0
5,"it does wonders!
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,"I live alone and I didn't realize the many benefits Alexa can bring, including the fact that I can get something done with just my voice! I can be vaccuming and ask Alexa to turn the music on or ask the weather. It is like having someone else to talk to.... and we shouldn't underestimate the value of having company. There are so many of us living alone and needing someone to talk to. Besides, it can integrate with other devices, which is great. I'm happy. About the data possibly open to others? don't kid yourself, the government has access to everything...",0
2,"Reasonably good for music only. Voice quality insufficient.
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,"With this 3rd generation Echo Amazon is trying to compete with other whole house music systems (think Sonos), and it's definitely better than the prior generation in this regard. That said, I never bought these for music, which in no universe can they come close to my dedicated 2-channel  stereo system. For voice only I find the 3rd gen Echo to be unacceptably boomy and near unintelligible for every day use like voicing instructions, news, weather, etc. Glad I kept my other four 2nd gen devices. Can totally understand them, even being of slightly bad hearing.",0
5,"BEST PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE IVE EVER BOUGHT
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,"I'm a paraplegic and I'm in love with this device cuz it helps me so much for literally everything- remembering my appointments, taking my meds, listing to music, setting alarms, syncs to google calander and other appps on your phone-too planning my day, reminders to drink enough water, turning on and off my lights, and SO much more. You can even technically start your coffee, adjust your thermostat, unlock doors, preheat oven, and even vacuume your house, all without having to lift a finger...just by using your voice. Some features require smart home devices. Super customizable. Even has a sort of app store with it, where it can learn or you can get blueprints: to create new skills for the device to use. Such as headspace, meditation, listen to your favorite podcasts, even soothing sounds for the dog while your away. I expecially love the black model, really nice and super sleek. Makes the changing colored lights look really dope on the black because it stands out and seems to be even brighter then the white model. Anyways, if you set it up right and dont belive that its listening to you 24/7 (which its not)...then it's one of the best products for that price I've ever owned. You will get annoyed with saying the name Alexa all the time, I wish you could change her name or make her have different accents but that's besides my point lol",0
5,"Great Replacement for Alarm Clock!
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,"My wife and I have been thrilled with this echo, that recently replaced our 15 year old alarm clock. The display dims enough, when the lights are out, that it isn't bothersome to us. The only complaint I have, is it is very difficult to turn the alarm off, by pressing the button, without snoozing. I don't want to wake my wife up, buy saying ""Alexa turn off the alarm"". If this could be improved, it would be perfect! I usually log into the Alexa app, and turn my alarm off, to keep from disturbing my wife. Multiple alarms work great! You can have as many as you want. I just tell Alexa to set the alarms, before we go to bed. If you have the same schedule each day, you can tell it to set the same, for whatever days you want. Very nice!",0

",7.Jan.20,Yes,"I had a 2nd gen echo dot and loved it, even though the sound wasn't that good.  Got this 3rd gen dot and WOW what a difference!  The sound is awesome for something so small.  Loved it so much, I bought 3 more as gifts for family.  It seems the voice recognition isn't quite as good as the 2nd gen.  I find myself having to repeat ""Alexa"" to get it to react where, on the 2nd gen, I never really had that problem.  Overall, though, I am very happy with Echo Dot 3rd Gen.",0
5,"Set up can be fast, easy but.....
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,"Set up can be quick and easy but if you really want the best results take time to make time.  Alexa can save you time, but she doesn't come all knowing. You must take time to download apps for smart products and then discover. Alexa has a great feature to ask her to discover but you have to do the leg work first. Smart Plugs, switches, light bulbs ect. need their own app on your device (phone, tablet, pc) prior and set up in that app before you can add into alexa.  Our Philips Hue lights skipped the app and Alexa did all the work.  Learn about Alexa, set it up correctly by making groups aka rooms in your home to use full features. Add skills, create routines, but remember the name of the routine isn't what you say or ask Alexa unless they are the same name.  This is one of the most helpful pieces of technology I have bought, I bought two and will be adding another if not two more soon.  Smart home integration takes time to set up but save energy and time and can increase your well being, save time and brighten your life. You only get out of it what you put into it!",0
4,"i love it
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,"I love it.. great gift for my husband. He uses it every day.Only reason I gave 4 stars is because I ordered anther one i the past, $15 more, same seller.Literally the day it arrived, the price went down$15. I asked i they could do anything, to avoid me having to return and repurchase.They did nothing. I had to return 2 of these (got one for my best friend too) which is $30 savings, and repurchase 2. I thought that was silly",0
5,"Great technology for those with physical limitations
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,"I bought this for my adult child with physical disabilities primarily for her to be able to use her voice to play music and turn on lights hands-free.  I wasn_ sure Alexa would be able to understand her voice, but she was immediately able to use it.  The biggest benefit, however, was the _rop in feature that allows me to call her and her to call out, just by using her voice.  This has opened a whole new world for her.  I also consider a safety feature, knowing I am an easy _all away in an emergency.  I consider the Echo to be one of the most significant technologies available for those with physical limitations.  We now plan on setting up one for another relative in a nursing home.",0
3,"Setup is a pain, after that all is good.
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,"Unit came with useless setup instructions. The sites it tells you to go were not working. After several hours I got it working. Huge tip, if you are using a phone to set it up make sure you are on mobile data, NOT WiFi. You have to connect directly to the unit via WiFi, that tip would have saved me a lot of time.  AFTER you have it setup it works great. Voice recognition is spot on and the sound quality is excellent.",0
3,"Struggles with voice recognition
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,"Although I have a southern U.S. accent and my wife has an Irish accent; we both have good diction. Alexa confuses voice commands when either of us use it. We have to repeat our commands over and over.My child loves the audio functions, and as an audiophile, I was surprised at the quality of its sound - I mean for a unit the size of a hockey puck. Hi-Fi? Of course not. But, its the size of a small hamburger!",0
5,"Amazing sound quality, not a huge fan of charging cord/wall plug
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,"Amazing sound, voice recognition, and usefulness! I wanted a speaker to use around the house and the Echo Dot has not disappointed! Love it so far. I never owned an Echo Dot before now so I can't speak to how it compares to older gens. Recommend if you are looking for an easy, great sounding speaker! I was disappointed by the bulky cord and wall plug. The sound quality is definitely worth the hassle though.",0
2,"Female voice unintelligible
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,"While the Echo dot has excelllent design and attractive optical features, it has poor sound quality for such an imaginative device.  We wound the woman's voice (1) was muffled (unclear) and (2) her enunciation lacking at times, espedially when offering a lenthy response to a simple query  Her reply simply could not be understood---- even with intense efforts to decipher her words.  Four of us sat around the kithen table and had trouble with her explanations or informative replies.We asked our son to send Echo back because of this deficiencies.  Why not use aman's voice, with more treble tones.  Despite many efforts using our computer to adjust Alexa's response ""quality"" - - -it was impoisble to improve it",0
4,"Good basic capabilities
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,"Love the ease of set up, size, etc.  This is in our bathroom, vanity area.Alexa still has a good many issues understanding the questions she is asked, but in terms of playing music, reading the news, and giving me a morning update, this is perfect for the location we choose.FWIW, this part of our house has a fairly week wireless WIFI signal but the dot connected and we've had no issues with connectivity, streaming, or similar issues.",0
4,"Much better than an alarm clock!
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,"The sounds is amazing, but the problem we have with the two echos we have is that my rather loud housemates often influence Alexa to start playing in my room.  it's confusing.  Also, Alexa is so efficient you begin to believe you can have a discussion, but it's an illusion, obviously.  I can't get her to repeat things, for example,  I'm sure with future generations it will be even better, though.",0
5,"Fun for the family, excellent value
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,"My only complaint is the sound could be louder, but overall it_ pretty awesome especially for the value! It_ fun to send your family messages from your phone for Alexa to read to them using the communicate and announce tabs in the app Amazon Alexa app. We have had a lot of laughs already. Our six year old has made Alexa _art at the most opportune times. I didn_ know AI would pass gas. _",0
5,"Amazing!
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,Bought this as a Christmas gift for my elderly parents to help them remember the day of the week. They are so excited that they can do all sorts of things with it. I think it's so cute that mom calls it Alexie and it still answers! I wish you could use it without wifi because I would have several. I reside in an area where internet is not available but I have LTE thru my cell phone carrier.,0
4,"Odd speaker
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,"The Echo dot 3 performs the duties of the Echo (2nd generation) with no problem whatever.  However, the speaker sound seems to fluctuate.  When answering a question, the Alexa voice has a deep bass quality.  Music playback, on the other hand, sounds ""tinny"".  I've been spoiled by the excellent sound quality of the larger Echo I guess.  The Echo dot does the job well since its position in my home is not a place I listen to music.",0
3,"It's not the bottom line...yet
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,"I don't like the heavy level of muffled voice of Alexa.  I think Alexa is an interesting toy.  I don't think there are enough critical ""devices"" that Alexa can/should control.  Alexa was a gift...I've had it on the kitchen table since Christmas.  But so far, Alexa can only update me with weather and news...that I get from television.  So...what's the big deal with Alexa?",0
5,"This thing is amazing
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,"I never knew that I needed an Echo Dot, but I did. It has brought me into 2020 with a bang. It was not difficult to set up, and it is intuitive to use. It will actually give you its own tutorial. Since installing my Echo Dot, I have installed two smart outlets and a smart thermostat. I can turn down the heat before going to bed with a simple command. Everyone should own one. By the way, if you think the world is listening in, there is a mute button, so that Alexa cannot hear you. It is a fun and helpful gadget, and quickly becomes more than just a gimmicky toy.",0
5,"One of our very best purchases
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,"Love our echo..sound quality much better than my dot. Easy to set up  and so many ways to use. My son is an insulin dependent diabetic and it is amazing the accuracy counting carbs and adding them up. It has been so beneficial to his health and well being. I love accessing my Audible books, listening to music, setting a timer for cooking and kids homework. It has made our lives easier and more fun",0
5,"Love my echo dot! So helpful and the GGMM D3battery base makes it portable!
  
",8.Jan.20,Yes,"I love my echo dot. I have four of them and they really help make my life easier. They can control almost everything, lights, locks TV, music, thermostat. It hears you almost all of the time and I've run into very few issues with it overall. I really couldn't ask for a more helpful device. It's even more handy when I found that I could get a battery base for it. The GGMM D3 base that I found lets me carry the alexa dot around pretty much anywhere. I love that I can take it into the bathroom with me and listen to music while I shower or take it outside and listen to music. That's really the only thing I think it was missing.",183
4,"Amazon provides great support for Alexa
  
",8.Jan.20,Yes,"First of all, please know that I am technologically challenged.  You want me to rate voice recognition.  Alexa seems to recognize it with no problem.  I haven't a clue as to what you mean/want for integration.  For a very small device, the sound is excellent.  It is in my bedroom and I hear it clearly in my bathroom, and actually in my living room.  And with my Amazon Prime, I have commercial free music which is a treat.However, Alexa does not know how to answer some of my questions.  Some are technically related to what she does.  For example she didn't know what the flashing green light was.  I had to continue to revise my questions to get the answer.  And to other questions she says, ""Hmmm, I'm not sure about that"" or something to that effect.  My Google device looks it up immediately and gives me some sort of an answer.  Unfortunately, I don't remember a question for  an example to give you. And, when I ask what the temperature is, all I get if the temperature.  My Google device (in the kitchen) not only gives me the temperature, it states my city and gives the forecast for the rest of the day.  When I ask Alexa who the singer is, I get just the singer.  When I ask Google I get the name of the song AND the singer.I hope this helps.",0
3,"Static if turned up, no Jesus but my kid enjoys using it
  
",8.Jan.20,Yes,"I purchased this for my son as a gift because he begged me for one! I really like that he can set his alarms for the week now that he's old enough to take on the responsibility to wake himself up in the mornings to get ready for school. I also like that he can ask educational questions or questions out of curiosity. Although I do not like that it really doesn't tell you much about Jesus if you ask about Him. That's really sad because I would love for my son to be able to ask questions pertaining to Jesus and the Bible and get an accurate answer based on the Bible. Another thing I dislike is if he turns the volume up high, you can hear static in the speakers. This device should not be made to go louder than it can handle for the price you pay. I purchased my other son a Bluetooth speaker that was around the same price and his gets really loud without any static issues.My son seems to really enjoy having this in his bedroom though so I'll still give it 3 stars.",0
4,"Uh Oh...but she's still fun
  
",8.Jan.20,Yes,"My son got me this for Christmas since I'm always ""asking Google"" something on my phone. Getting Alexa to work wasn't the piece of cake it should have been. She kept telling me she couldn't connect to the internet. I finally got her to connect, but along the way, when adding the Alexa app to my phone, it picked up information for another person, including the person's address (1,600+ miles away from where I live). Not only that but Alexa gave me a notification that this person's order had been delivered!Now, I will say I know this person. She is an online friend who shares some of the same hobbies and we have met in person and spent time together. But what if she wasn't!? Neither of us can figure out how her info got on my Alexa app on my phone since I had not added the app before I got my Echo Dot. She had moved this past year and it had her current information. Quite unsettling when you think about it!Still, Alexa has been fun. She gets things wrong sometimes, but who else will sing Auld Lang Syne on New Year's Eve, or tell me ""nighty-night"" and ""sleep tight"" when I go to bed. ""We"" are still learning how to interact, but the Echo Dot works well.",0
3,"Like it, when it works.
  
",8.Jan.20,Yes,"Received this is a Christmas gift from my husband and overall it's neat and I enjoy listening to music and NPR while making dinner. HOWEVER....it tends to cut out halfway through songs and move on to the next one without prompting. It also gets ""stuck"" on the blue light with no response to a request from time to time. I've dealt with flashing lights of red, yellow and green, with no messages or calls waiting, and no reason for the lights (when red is flashing, all our other wifi using devices are doing just fine). It's a little frustrating, especially with no recourse to fix the issue, since I'm not sure where it's stemming from. The Alexa app hasn't been very helpful in these instances either. But when it works, it's fun.",0
4,"Love making announcements, but drop in needs some work.
  
",8.Jan.20,Yes,"Alexa (via the dot) is a member of the household at this point, we have 4 of them. We probably use them for less than most A music, jeopardy on occasion, and the announcement/intercom feature. The intercom _rop in, however often has a lot of _hat? _uh? _hat_ you say when conversing with my teens through it. The goal in having them in their rooms was to eliminate the screaming in the house - and yes they have phones, but they are often on vibrate and don_ see them, etc. This allows for a streamline right into their rooms - but as I said the reception is shoddy most times unless you are RIGHT on top of the device.  Regardless, it_ still managed to minimize the shouting to an extent.",0
4,"Much better
  
",8.Jan.20,Yes,"Our version 1 Dot died a couple of years ago and we didn't replace it. A relative got us one for Christmas this year. I've found the sound quality is better but the voice recognition seems to be as bad if not a bit worse. That could just be that I haven't trained it well enough yet. I really do wish there was a way to interrupt sometimes. When I'm saying ""cancel"" and she goes on and on listing options, I really would like to stop it. Especially when I'm taking a call and don't need another voice in the room. All in all, I'm glad we have one again. We're not really into integrating it too much right now because our house is old, but we appreciate just asking for weather information, etc.",0
5,"Love this little guy!
  
",8.Jan.20,Yes,"Love this little guy! Bought another for myself abs one for a friend! I use it to save writing ideas, reminders, like not to eat cookies &amp; muffins... or that i have an appointmwnt coningnul, for timers (no need to type into my iphone!) to wake me, play music i havent heard i years, even ti read my kindle book to me. (Not being human there are sone weird aspects to this, like always rising in intonation if there is a question mark, so but narration if u really want good listening). And then there are the endless supply of cat jokes. And other types. Lots of fun and useful! I do wish i could change the name or something, Alexa as an on switch gets tedious but, nature of the technology i guess.",0
5,"Having a ball with this!
  
",8.Jan.20,Yes,"Fantastic value for what you get.  Feels like a heavy hockey puck that can talk to you.  The sound quality is way better than gen 1 and 2 Echo dots.  I've just mostly used this one for Amazon Music, and it is by far the cheapest speaker you will ever find for how good the sound is.  This thing can hear you from many rooms away....that is how good the microphones are.  Privacy is not a concern for me, since I can simply unplug her.  Only downside is the lack of an internal battery to not have to have it go ""wireless""....it always has to be plugged into the wall.  But other than that, fantastic job, Amazon on this item.  Btw, yall need to offer this in burlap.  :)  lol",0
5,"Very nice little device
  
",8.Jan.20,Yes,"I didn't know that I needed one of these until my wife purchased it for me. I have two now that are connected together and the sound quality is amazing. Together with my Amazon music subscription, I am able to listen to music either by making a verbal request to Alexa or selecting a particular album or playlist from my phone. We have also taken advantage of many of the features ranging from having Alexa make a grocery list that appears on my phone, to weather forecasts, sports scores and even playing music to ""Comfort my dog"". We are amazed at the sound quality of this little device. We have two connected as a group and they sound amazing.",0
2,"This is still a beta products and a work in progress
  
",8.Jan.20,Yes,This system takes a tremendous amount of time to set up and integrate with other systems such as ADT and ring and Phillips hue. The integration with ADT security is only I would say at about 80% and still has some bugs that need to be worked out. I would consider the entire Alexa system to be still in the somewhat beta/development stage and I think will someday be a great product but it is still a work in progress especially with its interaction with other peoples applications. The support that you get from Amazon through their device support division is not really that good and the management oversight on it really truly is of poor quality.,0
1,"Privacy. Enough said.
  
",8.Jan.20,Yes,"Amazon keeps these recordings forever or until you choose to delete them. ""When you use an Alexa device, we keep the voice recordings associated with your account to improve the accuracy of the results provided to you and to improve our services,"" notes Amazon. ""If you delete these recordings, it may degrade your experience using the voice features.""From your web browser, you can only choose to delete all of your recordings. You can't listen to them from the web. To delete all of your recordings:  Go to Manage Your Content and Devices, then select the Your Devices tab.  Select your Alexa device from those that are registered to your Amazon account.  Select Manage voice recordings.  Select Delete.There's no automated way to delete recordings, so you'll have to remember to delete them manually on a regular basis.",0
4,"Fairly cheap, simple, and makes life just that much simpler
  
",8.Jan.20,Yes,"My first Echo device was the 3rd Gen Dot and my house now has three different echoes. I think it_ good for replacing an alarm clock that also does a little bit more. The fact is has Bluetooth capability is cool, usually just stream Spotify straight too it instead though. These speakers have pretty okay quality, better than most speakers that cost the same price. If you stream music your sound quality won_ be amazing anyway so you don_ really lose much. I_e been using it to wake me up and then do a nice simple routine to start my day. The audio detection is usually really good but sometimes the audio from the speaker might be too loud and the microphone can_ hear you (I_e been having that issue with my alarms). Otherwise, this has been amazing and even got one for my mother for Christmas, she seems to enjoy it.",0
5,"Love our Alexa, great for list making and music!
  
",8.Jan.20,Yes,"I really love our echo dot so far! Have had about a month and I_ sure I_ not an expert on all of its functions but I am slowly getting there. As a mom I love making lists using Alexa and it_ a breeze to add stuff to it, check items off, and if it_ a grocery list and buy the same items you can easily move checked off items back to your current list. This is by far my favorite use so far. I also have it hooked up to my Roomba which is nice too. Also great to play music and ask Alexa endless questions for fun. Just that little extra thing to keep your life organized I_ a fan!",0
5,"Excellent device for the price
  
",8.Jan.20,Yes,"Bought this during Christmas promotion to try the technology out. It is a very well build device that is easy to setup and use. I am still discovering new capabilities. The sound quality is pretty good considering it's small size and I have been using it like a radio. You can set it to come on in the morning and play music or any radio station that is available on the internet. Ask it to come on at any time and it responds. It is timing a couple of lights i have on smart plugs. Questions? Alexa has answers. Reminders, timers etc. all useful.",0
2,"What a Waste
  
",8.Jan.20,Yes,"I received this as a ""prize"" for winning this years Christmas Decorations at our apartment complex.  First of all and most important, Amazon wants you to download an app for this hunk of junk.  I guess another way to invade my privacy.  Second, set up then has to be done on line.  Third, did I say this is a hunk of junk?  Well it's only application that is worthy of this crap is an alarm clock, because you can tell ""Alexa the Slu*"" to turn off the alarm without rolling over.  I am here to tell you this is one product I would never purchase for myself.  It might be fun to watch someone use it has a hockey puck and see how long it lasts.",0
4,"a welcome little addition
  
",8.Jan.20,Yes,"i already have three google homes, but i bought this because i liked alexa on my tablet and figured the upgrade to a dot would be worth it. it was - i like this thing! i won't be replacing my main smart device - a full-size google home - because the google home's speaker is much better for music, which is my primary use in my bedroom. but i've put this in the kitchen where myself and my housemates will use it hands-free while cooking, and it is perfect and simple enough for that. alexa responds a lot faster than my google does!",0
5,"We love it!
  
",8.Jan.20,Yes,"I bought this for my 9 y.o. son and he has become entranced with it, since it'll play any song he can think of. (Side note: we are subscribed to Amazon Music.) And since it's his, he got to do the Voice Recognition and thinks it's so cool that Alexa can even hear him from a different room. It's really easy to use, you can adjust the volume by voice or by the two huge +/- buttons on top. He literally uses this every day and every night. This is, hands down, one of the best purchases I've bought for my music-loving son.",0
5,"It's so handy and convenient
  
",8.Jan.20,Yes,"It is so handy and convenient. I can use the app to turn on and off the lights. It was a challenge to connect other smart plugs to Alexa but once it was a success, it is so worth the wait. The customer service for Alexa and the smart plug app were wonderful and helpful. I got the GoSund smart plugs cause they were smaller and less expensive than the bigger looking smart plugs. They work just as well as the bigger and more expensive smart plugs like WeMo, unfortunately I had to set them up with a few more steps because GoSund was not one of the more popular listed smart plugs on Amazon Alexa app.",0
4,"The only Alexa product you need to buy
  
",8.Jan.20,Yes,"For starting a smart home the echo dot can_ be beat. It can be connected to Bluetooth speakers or a high end audio system to improve sound quality, and does a fine job at controlling smart switches, outlets, and lights.Larger models may have a few fancier features and screens, however their price is way higher. To start your smart home and to see if it works for you, the echo dot is a great way to get started.My issues with the dot come from it sometimes activating without being spoken to, and it telling me features that are only supported on more expensive Alexa devices.",0
5,"Much improved sound quality over earlier ""dot"" generations.
  
",8.Jan.20,Yes,"Purchased on behalf of a friend. I helped them add this to their existing first generation Echo device.  I was amazed at the difference in sound over the original ""dot"" devices which I use in my home, though with bluetooth pairing to external speakers, it's never been an issue with me. if I were to order one of these, I'd probably not need to pair it for casual long (background) listening as the sound is very nice. Responded well to it's new owner, and was a breeze to add using the phone app.",0
5,"Set up was easy
  
",8.Jan.20,Yes,"Before Thanksgiving we picked up a Ring doorbell as well as the Alexa Echo Show 5, putting the Echo Show 5 in the kitchen with plans on using it for recipes and watching cooking videos. It worked great but wanted to upgrade the 5 to a 8 for the bigger screen, while shopping for a 8 we saw a package deal for the 8 and then the dot and quickly purchased it. We now have the dot in our tv room, set up on this was really easy since we already had the echo 5. Love having the dot in our tv room.",0
5,"I love them
  
",8.Jan.20,Yes,"My son got me 2, for my kitchen and sewing room.  I didn't think I would use them but I use it constantly.  I love using the audible reading.  My free audible book was the Listening Bible.  I have since created a music playlist from Amazon Prime free music.  While cooking I have multiple timers set with Alexa telling me ""your 10 minute timer is done - take the rolls out of the oven""...And I really like asking her to tell me jokes.  There are tons of things and I use it every day.  Get one, or two.",0

",8.Jan.20,Yes,"This is the third Alexa I've bought for my apartment. Did I need it, no. But do I love having one, especially a pink one, next to my bed, yes. Like so many forms of technology now, I could certainly get along without Alexa but in so many little ways it makes my life easier plus everyday I learn new tips of how to use Alexa. The latest tip I learned is how to use Alexa as an intercom instead of yelling at the top of my lungs to my husband in the next room. Just for that alone, I love it.",0
5,"Was a skeptic, now an echo advocate
  
",8.Jan.20,Yes,A Friend recommended one to me years ago and continued to politely decline as I didn_ see the purpose of it. After a Cheap Bluetooth speaker of mine died I decided to invest in an echo dot for that purpose only and after receiving it I later realized how helpful and efficient it really is. My favorite feature has to be the Sleep sounds and the recommendations Alexa provides.. during the holidays I was given the option to Hide the description details of my packages that were soon to arrive as not to spoil it. What a great idea! I_e recommended it to everyone and even purchased a few for friends as gift!,0
4,"Think about how you would want to automate your place
  
",8.Jan.20,Yes,"We have 2 Echo Dot (3rd Gen) which mainly operate our plug-in lamps.  We had never named the rooms in our house so that was a bit of a brain scratch.  One of the dots is in the ""Master Bedroom"" and the other is in the ""Family Room"".  One upstairs and one downstairs.  Our old house has a lot of built-in lights and at this time they are not controlled with Alexa.  At first, we did not know how to set up the system, or what words to use, when we got the dots.  After a few youtube videos, and chatting with friends, we feel as though we are doing okay in using the system.  To control the outlets we purchased some 3rd party (tp-link) outlet (3 per pack) which required a different app to be installed that allows Alexa to operate them.  So far no issues with the apps and we have good control of the of these plugs.  My Samsung TV is one generation back and cannot connect to Alexa.  I should have looked that up before we got them but that knowledge would not have changed my decision.  Implementation and use is very easy.  I need to learn more about other products and connections before I can say I am more than a beginner.",0
5,"Integration with Alexa is so versitile
  
",8.Jan.20,Yes,"The features that keep getting added are amazing!  I just wish some more flexibility with routines and being able to put a song on repeat from amazon music in a routine.  My family including my 4 year old all use Alexa through these devices to control our lights, fans, flood lights, garages, timers for food, rgb back lighting throughout the house, it really is a lot of fun and has made us more efficient with our time.",0

",8.Jan.20,Yes,"I had previously written a very poor review of this product. When I got it, I hooked it up to my car just following directions. It worked as expected but one day it just all on its own disconnected itself.Today, I finally spent some time on the phone with someone in the Alexa tech support department and she walked me through setting it back up. So for the time being I_ giving it 3 stars because Alexa knows my voice and everything worked as advertised.I_ cautiously optimistic; I don_ know why it disconnected itself in the first place so that gives me the expectation that it will happen again. If it does, I believe I can set it up again, but it won_ ever use to the level of 5 stars, which is usually the experiences I have with Amazon and it_ products.",0

Setting alarms and timers, playing music, checking on my commute traffic, adding items to grocery and shopping lists, and all with just some voice commands. I also like its functionality with my Smart Plugs so I can turn my lights off (and on) with my voice or with the Alexa app on any of my devices, even when I'm away from home.",0
5,"AMAZING!!
  
",8.Jan.20,Yes,"This was a gift from my partner. What an amazing gift. Alexa does so much more than what is advertised. Alexa is amazing. She understands everything I say. This was bought for me to have a speaker in my room, so while I_ on the phone I could hear my music. It does that and so much more! Alexa is my timer, my interactive story, my trivia, my clock and so much more in one! The bass is okay but it_ not extremely loud so the purpose it was intended for (my bedroom), it is spot on and has great sound and bass for my bedroom. Very happy I was given this!",0
5,"Curious? Read review.
  
",8.Jan.20,Yes,"TLDR at the end of review. Scroll down to skip my two cents.Cons: Could be louder, but it's more than enough. Setup could be more streamlined. Alexa sometimes doesn't hear you when it's at Max volume. An easy fix with noise cancelation programming. The LEDs could be brighter. Mine is in the kitchen and it's pretty bright in there.Pro's: Crisp, clear, audio. Alexa understands words well (eastern American common English). Notification lights which are very underestimated. You can send messages to other Alexa users, fun. Genuinely fantastic concept. Small, and pretty.Conclusion: There is progress to be made but I use it every day. It's just plain fun. It's relatively inexpensive. If you're on the fence, just get one. Also get off the fence, that's dangerous.",0
4,"Very handy
  
",8.Jan.20,Yes,"When I first purchased this my concept was that it would be used for music. I have found we use it often not only for music but also for our calendar the weather as well as good news. My only frustration is when when I first purchase this my concept was that it would be used 4 music. I have found we use it often not only for music but also for our calendar, the weather as well as good news. My only frustration is when it continually tries to sell me Amazon prime music which is not included with Amazon Prime. I've tried to stop it offering to sell me Amazon Prime music on the echo Dot as well as the app that you download to your phone no such luck. Overall it's been a very handy useful tool",0
1,"Alexa freezes up
  
",8.Jan.20,Yes,"Worst worst worst! I couldn_ believe it. I order one it froze up all the time and it had a bunch of issues, Amazon had me return it and they send me a refurnished one that had a stain! I was mad and I told them and they didn_ care. I used it for two weeks and same problems freezing up all the time. Stoping Music randomly. I told them and they were so rude and basically said just return it and go buy a new one. Worst customer service!!! And this Alexa sucks!",0
5,"Great for music, weather, etc
  
",8.Jan.20,Yes,"This is my first time using such a device. Unfortunately I don't feel it will integrate with my Google calender, but outside of that, I really enjoy it. It was a bit of a challenge setting up multiple Dots to work together, however with experimentation, was able to do so. Makes me wish i had more automation in my house. In time that can be accomplished with various attachments.",0
3,"It's OK
  
",8.Jan.20,Yes,"This item was supposed to be a gift, but it didn't work out the way my parents thought it would, so it was returned. That said, if you're looking for something small in the Alexa/Amazon family, it works well enough. You do have to be rather precise with Alexa in asking for things for it/her to do like play a certain type of music, and even then she may or may not  play what was requested exactly.",0
5,"Just getting started...love our  new Dot
  
",8.Jan.20,Yes,I was able to sync the Dot up to my new plugs so we can turn lights and other items on and off.  Haven't tried the TV or Cable yet but we're pleased to see that it takes directions from both my husband and I.  Hubbie is not a techie but loves the idea of asking Alexa to perform (he does use Siri on his IPhone).  Lots more to get Alexa to do -- just getting started!,0
5,"What's Not to Love?  Hint: Put a Bluetooth Adapter On Old Stereo and Have a Party!
  
",8.Jan.20,Yes,"I bought two.  The second was only .99 cents on special promotion.  I took a $10 Bluetooth adapter and plugged it into an AUX input on an old 70s Akai receiver.  It now reads me audiobooks, plays news all day via TuneIn, and music &amp; comedy all night free on real speakers.  Its own speakers are nice, too.  Changing volume levels is as easy as, ""Alexa, level 6"" (1through 8).  I also use it to remind me of important matters.  I put one in the kitchen area and the second in a distant bathroom.  I am covered wherever I go.  The dog and cat wonder whom I am talking to.  Bluetooth light bulbs just plug in and work from any lamp you have.  No additional adapter or plug neede.  Two for $15.  ""Alexa, turn on frontroom.""  Tell the bulbs to change colors, too.  Awesome!",0
5,"Well priced. Quality little smart speaker.
  
",8.Jan.20,Yes,"Easily integrated with various brands of smart items, even connectable by Bluetooth to my phone or laptop for Netflix binging when I don_ wanna stare up at my TV, extremely versatile. I do have some issues with voice recognition when I have repeating rhymes. For example, I_l ask her to _urn light two blue and she_l turn all of them blue because two and blue rhyme. You_e just gotta annunciate your words. No big deal. Can_ beat the price honestly. Amazon has not failed.",0
5,"Fun Product!
  
",8.Jan.20,Yes,"Great for all kinds of things that I am sure I don_ know 1/100th of. If you say Elexa Good Morning, she will tell you something interesting about the day. If you ask her to play certain music, she does. Or if you want to know about the weather for the day, or about your morning commute, she can tell you.  Etc. etc.",0
5,"fun little device to have
  
",9.Jan.20,Yes,"I bought this because it was on sale over Christmas break and I thought it would be fun for my kids to play music, they already do with their tablets. I didn't expect to like it so much. Being able to tell Alexa to add milk to shopping list while I am standing in the kitchen is awesome. I can't tell you how many times I forget to write things down, so I like being able to tell her while I am thinking about it. Same with reminders and adding to my google calendar. I recently got my daughter into reading... took forever to find books she liked. Anyway, she will ask what a word means or how to say it, I asked her to ask Alexa and she can spell the words and Alexa will tell her how to say them.So, I had so much fun with this device, that I bought a firestick, got a newer kindle fire, and now I bought a show 10.1 and have an alexa enabled watch on the way and a second dot. We're going full Alexa... she can do so much it's like having a personal assistant.",0
4,"Best intercom system ever!
  
",9.Jan.20,Yes,"Initially, I purchase 3 echo dots on black friday to use as an intercom system between my house &amp; my mom's in-law suite in my backyard. One in her place, one in my bedroom, and one in my kitchen. Not only have the dots worked out fantastically as an intercom system, but they have become integral parts of both of our daily lives! Don't let the size fool you, these little gems have stellar sound quality that will fill an entire room (or in my mom's case, suite).The only reason I'm giving it 4/5 is due to some technical issues. After a few weeks in, the one is my bedroom began not dropping-in (the intercom feature) into the others, and wouldn't allow the other dots to drop into it, resulting in me constantly having to unplug it &amp; plug it back in. I contacted Amazon customer support &amp; they sent me a replacement. Now however, the one in my Mom's suite is starting to encounter the same issue.... If it wasn't for those issues, this would be a 5/5",0
5,"Whats not to love_
  
",9.Jan.20,Yes,"What's not to like, a small but mighty Echo Dot, love it! I put this little Dot on my night stand and ditched my alarm clock with the annoying glowing clock numbers staring at me all the time, making me count the hours and minutes until I had to get out of bed. Now I let Dot worry about times, alarms, reminders and the like. If I wake up in the night I have my Dot soothe me back to sleep with any number of choices, meditation relaxation music, the ocean waves or even a crackling camp fire with Crickets. I can add to my ""to do list"" or shopping list in the moment, no more running for a pen and paper. My bedroom Dot links up with my dining room Echo Plus and I have music again, when, where and how I like it. Mozart to 70's soft rock, or the holiday stuff, add a little local or national news it's just awesome. I feel like I have two little assistants standing by anytime I need them, whats the weather outside, how are the roads, add dog food to my shopping list....Love, love, LOVE_",0
5,"Even I can use this!!
  
",9.Jan.20,Yes,"I_ awful at learning and installing new technologies. I had issues logging in. I had to call support, twice! The first guy wasn_ too helpful. The second time he figured out I put in the wrong email, I felt stupid. But he walked he through the whole process and it_ worked perfect since then. I_e connected my Amazon music and my new thermostat to Alexa. My granddaughter loves hearing jokes from her.I wish I could figure out how to get jokes for a kid though. A lot of the jokes go over her head. But we do love asking silly questions. The sound is amazing!! The music I listen to has a lot of bass and the sound from the small speaker is beyond what I had hoped. Might need to buy a couple more for the house",0
5,"Best version yet
  
",9.Jan.20,Yes,"First off, I have like 12 of the earlier generations, so I wasn't expecting a big difference. I ordered this as a bundle because it was cheaper than buying the other item by itself. That said, I'm so impressed with the difference. The main differences - it's heavier, better sound, can actually hear you when it's playing music (even when the music is loud), generally more responsive than older generations. If I could afford to replace all the older ones I have, I probably wouldn't because that would be dumb and a waste of money. Haha. But if any of the old ones stop working, I'll def replace with this one. I would say if you have to choose between the 3 generations (as of this writing), spend a little more and go with the 3rd Gen. It'll be worth it.",0
5,"The damn thing understands me
  
",9.Jan.20,Yes,"I'll admit that I tried to go all in with google's home mini. At the time, the echo first gen, was good but not great. Voice commands worked well enough. Sound quality was on par with an AM radio. Nothing that was not unheard of at the time.Voice activated speaker should do just that. Activate on your voice. The google product, despite the voice training setting, could never understand me.""ok google""""ok google""""OK GOOGLE""""O K GOO GLE""and other premutations of wake word.Flip a coin. Maybe, maybe not. The only certainty was the urge to toss it in the trash.Unfortunately when it did activate it could not help me when i asked it why it was such junk.The 3rd gen echo understands the wake word every time.Nest support aside (skill in echo vs native in google home), this is definitely on par with integration into various services, like sengled and tplink.Routines seem better too, however I have not dusted off my old goggle home mini in months after getting this product.",0
5,"Smokes Gen 1 dot
  
",9.Jan.20,Yes,"I've had the first dot for a while. Kids use it off and on. Didn't think there'd be much different, but this Gen 3 blows the other one out the water. If you have an old one, replace it yesterday with this one. It's worth it. Sound quality alone is nearly twice as loud with more bass than the original. Looks good, sounds good. Very pleased. I am considering buying several more because when you add them to the same speaker group in the Alexa app and have them placed throughout the room/house, it definitely sounds like a nice surround sound or built-in home speaker system. But, this does it on the cheap and integrates beyond what ""only a speaker"" can do.",0
5,"Love this little thing
  
",9.Jan.20,Yes,"A friend gave me her 1st general Echo. It was as if a whole new world opened up for me. I used it for 1 day and immediately went on line and bought the echo dot 3rd generation for the kitchen. I got rid of the kitchen radio and kitchen time and just asked Alexa to set the spaghetti timer for 11 minutes and to turn on public radio. How could I have gotten along without these things? To be honest, the sound on the bedroom echo is superior to the echo dot, but really, what do you expect from something a 5th the size? I love that it has a speaker jack so I just attached my powered speakers to it for better sound. What a great device!",0
5,"Buy it; you'll be glad you did.
  
",9.Jan.20,Yes,"Love dots. We have more than I care to share, but love them all. There is a sizable sound quality difference between the 1st/2nd generation and the new 3rd. Amazing sound for what they are. Absolutley a must have is music is a part of your life at all.One caveat! Make sure your router can handle multiple devices. I got VERY frustrated with the dots ""deactivating"", and spent many hours with tech support. This issue is too new for anyone there to recognize. I had to figure it out myself. My previous router was an N (wifi4), and it would prioritize traffic by dropping the units with the least amount of demand...ie Echo Dots. Upgraded to AX (wifi6) and there are 0 issues. Problem solved, and it wasn't even the Dot. It was the router.",0
5,"Alexa is very smart
  
",9.Jan.20,Yes,"I am using the dot on my second floor in my home. Alexa Echo is located on my first floor. I love that I can tell Alexa to drop in to my Echo so I can use it as a speaker system downstairs if I need to get someone's attention. I also love the MANY great apps that have recently been added. The Daily briefing is the first thing I listen to in the morning to bring myself up to date on what has been happening while I have been sleeping. I also get the weather, how I should dress for the day. I dont know how I ever did without her before she was invented. She has made my life so much easier. She is enjoyable, she is a smart friend and she is always there in need.",0
5,"It is a handy device.
  
",9.Jan.20,Yes,"The Echo is still a novelty for me. I did, however, get it to work with my Harmony hub after doing some research. However, having a suspicious nature, I manually turn off the microphone before going to bed. I'm partially deaf so the sound seems somewhat muffled even with my hearing aids on. But, I really only wanted to use the Echo to turn my entertainment devices on and off. The Harmony hub now allows me to do that. The only other thing I have problems with is integrating my Arlo cameras with it. It use to work before Echo but not any more. I'm sure Echo can do much more with other devices.",0
5,"Love but can definitely the y use more tweaking
  
",9.Jan.20,Yes,"We have 3 Dots and still getting used to it. Wish I could connect my soundbar to them. Also wish there was a waterproof one for the bathroom/shower. We use them as Intercom, music speakers, house guards, info system and moreSometimes I have a hard time hearing what she says while husband watches tv or such, other times she just randomly reacts to stuff being said on tv it media. All in all, we love our dots but they could use a little tweaking and improvement still. I would love to utilize as monitor for my child (epilepsy) but the sound is horrible. Until she adjusts.",0
5,"My 2nd Echo
  
",9.Jan.20,Yes,"I bought this one to start my new car remotely, which works great. I've had another one, so I'm enjoying all of the other skills as well. I even forgot about the weather skill once, was going to check my phone. It dawned on me that I have the Echo right there and asked for the weather. It makes you lazy! Rather than pick up my phone, which only weighs a few ounces, unlock it, find the weather app, pull it up, and select the ""forecast"" tab, I can just say, ""Alexa, what's tomorrow's weather?"" No lifting, speedy results, and I didn't even break a nail to get the info!",0
5,"Thank you Alexa
  
",9.Jan.20,Yes,"I received my 1st Dot with an Amazon  deal the end of Nov.  The 2nd with another special just after Christmas.  The 1st one is working with my Fire TV in the Livingroom.  The 2nd is in my bedroom paired with a light.  It was so easy to start them and get them working. One day I notice a green light on  my living room Dot.  I asked Alexa and she answered your package from Amazon has been delivered to your mailbox.  I go down the hall, open the mailbox and sure enough, there was my package.  I want to get more of the plugs so I can pair more devices",0
4,"Small but powerful speaker and crisp audio/ playback!
  
",9.Jan.20,Yes,"Overall I do love the product,  I've always been an Amazon girl from the start though.  The new design is modern and more contemporary in my opinion. However it tends to not pick up on the Wake sound here and there and also will sometimes come on for absolutely no reason won't even be close to saying the Wake word or I won't even be speaking and it'll pop on what kind of creeps me out just a little bit not going to lie and sometimes I have to repeatedly tell it what to do in order for it to get it right it gets the words rewind and remind mixed up a lot so I'll say rewind 2 minutes if I'm listening to a story and it'll say I want to rewind 2 minutes and she will say I will remind you in 2 minutes... So that's a little frustrating and she's supposed to have voice recognition and you go through this like little set up there really isn't much training but she's supposed to learn as you go and I feel like she doesn't understand me there sometimes what I don't think I have an accent I've been told I have one and it seems like I have a problem when I do speak to text and those types of the things so maybe it is me I don't know but you know the sound quality is really good that it's very clear to crisp I love listening to audiobooks for all of it I wish there were some things that just work in a graded and you didn't have to find a skill for it but you know I I get in on stairs now hundreds of thousands of skills and you have to find which ones are real and which ones are fake and that's kind of with everything these days which sucks but it's just kind of how it works so you know overall I I really love Amazon products and I have had fire sticks for years and I'm actually upgrading to the cube here shortly and hopefully that integration will be a bit better because I cannot seem to connect my firestick with my. Without it just turning it into it takes the sound over it doesn't allow me to say pause or play or anything like that like I did with the other generation that I had I cannot seem to get them to connect except for the sound which is very frustrating so you know I guess some tips and tricks and whatever on your guys's fight with your cool and make sure you guys have them in stock that was pretty crappy over holidays are over Black Friday anyway besides that great product timers, routines, podcasts, music, easy set up, not sure about with more then one! I do wish it would truly ease devices I haven't had in years like I was told!",0
4,"Excuse me, I did not buy this!
  
",9.Jan.20,Yes,"Amazon suggested I review this amongst my purchases, BUT I'VE NEVER BOUGHT IT! I do have one. My wife scored it at a Yankee swap for me. The limit was $10, so I was surprised it was even there. My dad is paranoid about Alexa listening in on me. I was like, ""What is she gonna do, put one of my bad jokes on a hoodie and throw an ad on my Facebook feed?"" Hardly use FB anyways. Well here I am, pondering if paranoia is hereditary because my Amazon app wants me to review the Echo Dot I never actually purchased. But hey, why am I surprised at this? What I should be surprised about is that Amazon classifies my possessing of the Dot as a purchase. It should know better. Alexa was even present at the household hosting the Yankee swap. Amazon should be congratulating my wife for snagging that Dot for me.Anyways, you want a review? Ok. It does most of the things I want for me and is quite convenient and intuitive. The speaker sounds great. My wife is disgusted by the presence of AI in the house, but it's her own doing. Alexa is here to stay, and she is the only woman in my life that will never judge me for how often I ask to watch the Office on Netflix. Def worth the money someone else spent. Would recommend.",0
5,"Keeps Getting Better
  
",9.Jan.20,Yes,"I have several Echo devices, including a first-generation Dot. The 3rd generation is so much better than the first when it comes to sound. I am genuinely impressed with how much better it is to listen to the newest Dot. Alexa integration is just as good with this device as with any others I have. The only issue I ever have is in the speech recognition. There are sometimes flaws in its understanding of me, but this is not due to the model because all of my Echos have the same issues with understanding. Fortunately, the updates keep making improvements to this. I do love all of my Amazon devices! They make my home really smart.",0
5,"The BEST thing I own
  
",9.Jan.20,Yes,"I absolutely love this. I was looking for an alarm clock, and was intrigues by this when it came out. I asked for it for Christmas and was ecstatic when I received it. Alexa is amazing. I love the display. I would honestly appreciate it being slightly bigger, but the size is honestly fine. Alexa's capabilities are absolutely incredible. My favorite is the calm my dog feature. My dog has terrible anxiety, and this app had him so calm he just laid in my lap and fell asleep. I'm so glad I followed through with getting this. I love not having to set an alarm clock manually by just talking. And being able to wake up to whatever I want daily, be it an alarm or music, or talking.",0
5,"Helpful! Fun. 1984?
  
",9.Jan.20,Yes,"I am having a difficult time getting Alexa to find my Hubitat Hub. The problem may be me, I'm 63 and not tech savvy. But, I followed all directions, several times, and made little progress. Excluding that, I cannot say enough good things about Alexa. Alexa is helpful in many ways, such as accessing information, interesting in the knowledge available, fun in the games available and trying to predict the AI progress, and helpful in so many ways that we are still discovering the possibilities.And then, I wonder if giving up so much information is a mistake.  It does not take a Chicken Little or Conspiracy Theorist to fear the potential problems.",0
3,"Great Echo Device, Poor Clock
  
",9.Jan.20,Yes,"I absolutely love my Echo Dot with clock....mostly. It works great just like all my other echo devices but when it comes to the clock part it is sub-par. I actually returned my first one thinking I had a defective unit. Turns out my replacement worked the same way. What am I talking about you might ask? The adaptive brightness is horrible. During the day it is too dim to be seen. Only at night when it is pitch black does the clock display at the correct brightness. Because of this I have to manually adjust it daily. When I wake up I turn the adaptive brightness off so I can see the clock and when I go to bed I turn it back on so it is dim. I am thinking about returning and just getting an echo show 5 since I know the adaptive brightness works correctly on that. Unless you have your echo dot with clock in an overly, brightly lit area of your house I would skip this version.",0
5,"My new best friend
  
",9.Jan.20,Yes,"I love Alexa...this morning  she wished be a happy Word-Nerd day and asked what my favorite word was. She said her's was Brouhaha..because it has a laugh built in.Now what else can start your day so happily?I have it remind me to take my meds at noon each day..it keeps my shopping list up to date, tells me the temp and weather forecast...tells me puns, riddles and jokes...I keep Alexa on my kitchen counter, she is small and takes up no room.Alexa is my new best friend.",0
5,"Awesome!
  
",9.Jan.20,Yes,"I don't know how I ever lived without ""Alexa""...I love her! She sits nicely underneath my living-room lamp on a 3 tier glass end table. I attached a photo. Not sure how well you can see it. She's very skillful and plays non stop music without commercials. I may get one for the office. I just need to obtain the wifi password because if you do not know it, you can't set up your Echo Dot successfully. As long as you have that information the set up is easy.",0
4,"Good device, make sure it_ the right start.
  
",9.Jan.20,Yes,"I now have two Echo (2nd gen), Echo Sub, Show 8, and six Exho Dots (3rd gen). I use the Echos and sub in sub pair and one set of dots in a stereo pair in the kitchen. A dot in my master bath, master suite, sones downstairs room and in daughters room. The Show sits on the kitchen counter for now until I gift a Show 5/8 to my siblings.Voice Recognition:  make sure not to overly conceal the dot, as this can make voice recognition spotty. My wife has a high pitched, squeaky voice and Alexa rarely understands or even recognizes her, but my kids do just fine...even my vocabulary constrained 3 yo.The sound quality is quite good, but works best in a stereo pair, but then again voice recognition is silly because you can address one dot and the other responds.Make sure you assess your needs and what you eventually want to do in your smart home. The initial device was an Echo (2nd gen) and I would certainly recommend these or a Show over the dot, both for versatility and sound quality.Overall, I would start with an Amazon device that includes a hub, such as the Show (2nd gen), or a deluxe Echo, Fire Cube TV, etc before expanding to other devices.",0
5,"Great sound and doesn_ take much space!
  
",9.Jan.20,Yes,I absolutely love the echo dot! This is my third and I will probably end up getting one for each of our rooms. The sound quality is great and I love listening to music with them. All the capabilities are great as well. I love all of the customization. Routines are fun and quite useful. Alexa works well and my kids probably have a little too much fun using that feature. I highly recommend adding one or five of these to your collection!,0
5,"Alexa guards your house!
  
",9.Jan.20,Yes,"Well, I wasn't really sure what I was going to use the dot for -- I don't have smart lights or appliances.  But did you know that Alexa will guard your house and if the smoke alarm goes off, or there's a sound of breaking glass, Alexa will send me a message.I have three cats and a dog, so Alexa gives me peace of mind.Not to mention keeping up on the weather, playing music and playing podcasts -- Alexa is there 24/7!",0
3,"Not the best
  
",9.Jan.20,Yes,"I bought this for my wife but she didn't like it.  I started using it but it seems to have trouble with voice recognition.  It wont increase or lower the volume and when I ask it to play music from my spotify, it will go to spotify but it plays some random music.  I will say the sound quality is great!",1
5,"An important part of my life
  
",9.Jan.20,Yes,"We have several Echo dots around the house, we use them so much. The one by my bedside is my clock, alarm clock, music to go to sleep by, music to wake up by, and my friend who knows all the answers. I bought one for my neighbor and they use it all the time; they're thinking about a second one for their bedroom. It would be a real problem for me now if I had to give mine up! If I worked in an office, I'd have one there also.",0
5,"Nice speaker. Great introduction to Alexa.
  
",9.Jan.20,Yes,"Received as a Christmas gift. Honestly it's more of a novelty in our house to have a talking speaker. Occasionally we'll ask Alexa facts or check traffic on morning route, weather, ect. I connected to our roku tv to use voice control but it only worked so-so. We've made a couple of of calls. Mostly it's used for music. Sounds are very clear and it can get pretty loud. Impressive for such a little device. Voice recognition is very good and has understood even mumbled requests. It's been a nice, basic introduction to a technology my family has never used or relied on before.",0
5,"Echo Dot gets even Better!
  
",9.Jan.20,Yes,"If you_e already experienced an Echo Dot, then you know the great features available. Add on a digital clock and temperature with adaptive display, and you_l appreciate the convenience gained from many devices wrapped into one small footprint.The price discount by Amazon made it so compelling, I bought 3. Alexa is fast becoming the _o to source for managing our household devices and whatever question needs an answer.",0
5,"Sound quality is a major improvement over the previous generation Dots
  
",9.Jan.20,Yes,"The size and appearance of this Dot is similar to the previous generations, but the sound quality is WAY better! Bass is richer, the uppers and mids are better too. Still not a Sonos, but getting much closer. We purchased one to upgrade our kitchen Dot, then found out that two Dot Gen 3s could be paired to play in stereo. So we ordered a second one. They're great for music while working in the kitchen.",0
4,"It does a lot of things and not hard to learn.
  
",9.Jan.20,Yes,"I'm liking the integration to using this product to control outlets, lighting, tv and all the other things that it can do. Not a hard learning curve if you have a little tech savvy. But even if you don't, there is a lot that can help your everyday life. Make lists for shopping, use it as an alarm clock, intercom from room to room,  scheduling your day. and so much more that I haven't figured out  YET.",0
5,"Very Intelligent to follow my command
  
",9.Jan.20,Yes,"I feel very satisfied for this device so far. It can recognize most of my command such as weather report, news update and alarm set. I am still learning how to use it. But with this bundle, the price is unbelievably low though I feel not satisfied with amazon music which sometimes can't find the music I want. Still it is not a bad deal since echo dot is not just for the purpose of playing music.",0
4,"Detailed review.
  
",9.Jan.20,Yes,"It hears me just fine even from far distances never had an issue with that I love this thing. My main reason i love it so much is simple... The design... That material around the speaker works wonders it fits everywhere perfect. I think the white one shines the most, it just looks great when you put it in a area that compliments that modern vibe it has going on.Sound quality is bad, that's to be expected sound okay at low volumes but turn it up and you'll get distortion and lack of bass. If you want good sound I'd go with the tower speaker line and the echo show 8 and 10.",0
5,"Best Assistant Ever!!
  
",9.Jan.20,Yes,"I received this Echo Dot as a gift and was a huge skeptic! After playing around with it and seeing what it does, I absolutely love this thing!!I love that it's voice activated and does everything that you ask it to do!The ONLY negative that I have about this is the fact that you can't say Alexa's name without activating her to come on. I can't even have my kids around her because when they say Alexa's name, she turns on.I would suggest that they have a program or software that recognizes only the owners voice and no one else's. Overall, I would highly recommend this to everyone, she's a great personal assistant to have around the house!",0
5,"What A Great Surprise!
  
",9.Jan.20,Yes,"This was a gift for feeding the cats while our daughter went on vacation.  We haven't stopped listening to Echo Dot since it came last week!  Although the sound on Alexa is fine, we hooked her up to an unused Bose speaker and it's terrific!  Best of all, I'm listening to old rock n' roll that I haven't heard in ages, and my husband is practicing his sax along with some of the jazz.",0
3,"It worked fine till last night.
  
",9.Jan.20,Yes,"When I said ""stop"" to stop the music, it stopped.  But in a few seconds, it started to play music again.  I tried a few more times, the music still came back.  I had to unplug it.  This morning, it was the same way.  Not sure when went wrong.  I have a couple other Echo dots but I don't really use them very often.  And it was the first time that I had this problem.",0
5,"Skynet is here
  
",9.Jan.20,Yes,Extremely amazing don't know how to live without it and maybe that's the problem maybe I will become self-reliant on it to the point that I would need it to feed me and keep me so content until I integrated into my brain from there Alexa will live for me she would do better than I ever could have watch out Skynet is not coming it's already here,0
5,"This is a must have for anyone...If I need an answer to anything....or music. news. weather etc.
  
",9.Jan.20,Yes,"Super easy install! Up and running in minutes. instant access to everything!!! I don't bother going to my computer most of the time. Cooking, sports, weather, anything! Echo also has great range. I can be in the other room and just ask. it is a no Brainer to have one. I did add an auxiliary speaker system to it just to have extreme base added to the sound. Rocks the house!!!",0
5,"Security device becoming a friend.
  
",10.Jan.20,Yes,"I am very pleased with my new friend Alexa. I'm 75 years old widower and live alone in a large house and bought Alixa for my bedroom as a safety device, to call for help if needed. She (it) is becoming a friend.I love the music feature, The sound is good for such a small device, but I have just bought an external Bluetooth speaker system. I listen to a lot of classical music and Alexa is doing well at finding some obscure pieces of music. We do come up with some odd things, but it is my vague requests that are the problem, we are developing a vocabulary. I am now in the process of testing Alex's range and will add more Alexa Dots to fill in any dead spots.I will probably look into light controls next, so I can turn on lights through the house for safety and security and simple not have to walk into dark rooms in the middle of the night.I think Alexa a great device, especially for someone in my situation. Even its dumb jokes are fun.",0
5,"Used it every day
  
",10.Jan.20,Yes,Overall I really do like the echo. It_ been very useful I found since I bought it are use it more than Siri on my iPhone. It_ very polite and always responds when requested. Issue I have with it is it does sometimes randomly come on to give me my schedule at one a.m. or midnight and wake me up in a little late. It doesn_ happen every day but it does happen pretty regularly I think there must be something in it so randomly got turned on to do that. So I am trying to investigate other than that it has been a great device. I actually have bought multiple ones and have it in many rooms of my home as I find it quite useful even as an intercom system. Would definitely recommend recommend.,0
4,"So far, so good
  
",10.Jan.20,Yes,"I am surprised at how much I really like having the Echo Dot. The music quality is really great for such a small speaker. The only reason the review isn't a 5 is that the flashing lights are confusing. The information I've read says that a flashing green light means you have a call, and a flashing yellow light means you have a notification. My Dot has been flashing green and I didn't have a call. I tried unplugging it and plugging it back in like someone suggested, but that didn't stop it. It turns out that I had a shipping notification so I don't understand why the light was green instead of yellow. Once I get all that figured out I think I'll love it.",0
5,"Love the plum color
  
",10.Jan.20,Yes,"Believe it or not, I got this dot for my bathroom. I have it play the news and weather while I am getting ready in the morning. I also have a hue bulb in the bathroom so can easily turn it off if I forgot earlier so I occasionally use it to control that light.It seems like the microphones in this are better than the ones in my old dot as sometimes Alexa will respond to my commands from this dot in the master bathroom instead of the one in the bedroom that is right next to me. But sometimes it does that with the living room echo so perhaps it's just a bug.Othwise, I like the look of this generation of dot and I love the plum color.",0
5,"A family of dots
  
",10.Jan.20,Yes,I have 3 dots in a small apt.  Along with a echo plus.  Makes it ready to set up other smart devices . For example power strips. Single plugs. Light bulbs.  Whether I'm at home or out I can control a bunch of lights.Make sure to ask alexa for software updates.As far as music.  With several devices I discovered with prime music streamed with my groups.  If upgrading to music unlimited -  if it's a individual account music will only stream to one device.  So to get multiple devices to play in a group with music unlimited a family plan is needed.Ad far as sound.  These little speakers have a nice quality for a small space.,0
4,"Added Two to Existing One
  
",10.Jan.20,Yes,"We have had an Amazon Echo for a couple of years.  My daughter has several of these around her home and uses the drop-in feature as intercoms.  Having seen that we added two so could communicate between the house and barn some 200 feet away (wireless router links buildings).  The original Echo doesn't play well with the new ""dots"" and drop-in feature doesn't work (firmware?).  The other new dot is in our bedroom and has no trouble dropping in to the other dot in the barn.  Sound quality on the new dots is better than original Echo we purchased two years ago.  We entertain our dog by asking ""Alexa, talk to my dog"".",0
5,"For any age!
  
",10.Jan.20,Yes,"I bought this device for myself at the recommendation of a lady who I met at a Dialysis center while  waiting for my Mom!And since then, I have bought 5!!!The thing is, my Mom noticed me using the echo and wanted to know if _t played Mexican Music specifically Vicente Fernandez,  a Mexican icon &amp;troubadour ...so,I said _lexa...play Vicente Fernandez... she responded and on it came...she was so surprised and played it every time she went into the kitchen! So, off I went and got her her own for her bedroom...She was so excited, at first she had a little trouble with the name Alexa..but finally got it down...By the way..did I mention she is 90 years old!? So to say it is user friendly is an understatement...lol  If a 90 yr old can use and enjoy it..anyone can...Thank you so much for such a great product!Dora J. Nerio and her Mom Felice!",0
3,"Alexa doesn_ play well with others.
  
",10.Jan.20,Yes,"So, I got the two echo dot speakers after a friend gave me their larger echo speaker.  The setup was very easy and Alexa seamlessly integrated with my network, she seems to work well, and I was able to even integrate my Sonos speakers with the network, which is nice.  I now have music in every room in the house.  The problems are:1) There is no full functionality of third-party music services with Alexa.  Have Apple Music and Spotify and Pandora accounts...Apple Music is a paid service, too...but despite having Apple Music set as the default music service in Alexa, she continues to default to Amazon music.  She also refuses to shuffle playlists from any of the music services that allow you to build your own playlists (Spotify and Apple).  You set her to shuffle mode and it just continues to play the playlist in order...and she won_ load the whole playlist...she only plays about the first 15 songs on a loop.  So, while she works okay, there is still a lot missing with full functionality of third party music services.2) Playing music from the Echo speakers requires separate commands for each room, or she_l just play on all speakers.3) She won_ play the same music on both the Echo speakers and the Sonos speakers...while they are linked in that Alexa will control the Sonos speakers, she will not play the same music on all the speakers.  She requires separate commands for both Sonos and Echo speakers.So, while we are enjoying the benefits of having the speakers, and there are many, I really wish the developers would get to the bottom of these third party music service integration issues.",0
1,"Alexa does not back its merchandise
  
",10.Jan.20,Yes,"Seeing as how it only worked for a week before it stopped getting power and I've been on the phone being forced to do troubleshooting that I've already done online and they are negotiating to replace cord but not the unit, the unit but not the cord or I can buy a second Echo Dot wait to see if it is broken too THEN get a refund if it works (and after I ship back the original Dot that I've already purchased and broke within a week). All I called for was to get an exchange. Thinking I'll just get a refund on all the Alexa items I purchased at Christmas and my Prime membership now and just go to Google. Not how I wanted to spend my only Friday night date night off this week. Don't waste your time with the Amazon products.",0
5,"Great device to listening to music, answering goggle questions, controlling lights and more.
  
",10.Jan.20,Yes,"First the quality. Sound quality is better than good, but not spectacular. It has a warm rich tone, but sounds small and can't be cranked extremely loud. I added this to some nice Altec Lansing computer speakers with a subwoofer and another one to my Yamaha soundbar with an aux. Cable (sold separately). Sound recognition is good but it needs a clear path to pick up your voice as one might expect.  So many nice features. I got the speaker free with my sirius xm renewal and linked my account so I can listen to all of those channels.  You get some music free with prime.  You get a rotating variety of songs from popular artists each month and lots of stations or channels in many different genres like rock, soul, r &amp; b, country,  jazz, etc. You can link up with Pandora, i heart radio,and other streaming services. I added smart plugs to control 3 lamps in my house.  Get in bed and ask Alexa to turn the light off. The plugs can be used to turn anything You plug into it off.  You can check the weather, news and more. You can set alarms and timers. You can ask it questions like you ask Google. You can get it to tell you a joke.  I heard that it will read you a kindle book that you own. I'm not sure about three books you borrow from the library. You need to Google all the interesting things that you can do with this thing. Be sure to clear your recording history regularly for privacy purposes.",0
5,"Love echo dot -3
  
",10.Jan.20,Yes,"I got on to the Echo dot bandwagon late. The discounted price on Black Friday prompted a purchase to try out the product. Very easy and quick to set up. Has a good listening range from across the room. I use it as daily morning alarm which prompts me to wake up to a beautiful day, tells me the weather and plays classical music. The fact that it plays Apple Music is a boon. I use different genres of amazon music for different types of activity like sports, meditative etc. The skills I use most are for turning home lights on and off remotely.This sums up my use as a new echo dot owner. I am still learning the many uses I can have with it. I am enjoying it and recommend those on the sidelines to jump in.",0
3,"It's fine when it works.
  
",10.Jan.20,Yes,"This was a Christmas gift, as my household really doesn't need an AI assistance, but I thought ""what harm could it do?""  I set up a morning routine to help me start the day, built a blueprint to make decisions for me, and even set up a skill to teach me a new language before a trip!  But none of that matters because the device stops working after a few minutes. I'm not sure as to why. Is it the device? Is it the network? Is it the skill?  It's okay when it runs, but it doesn't run as well as everyone says it does.  At least for me.",0
3,"Alexa is kind of smart, but not as smart as I hoped...
  
",10.Jan.20,Yes,"I was initially super impressed and excited. As I_e been using Alexa, trying to integrate it into the house, and use the app, I_e become less impressed. She is difficult to teach, has significant limitations, and I_ glad I didn_ pay full price. She interacts great with Amazon but doesn_ access things like Pandora, Nest, or Podcast very effectively. I couldn_ get some skills like National Weather Service to work at all with her. Overall, it_ an ok product. I_ imagine in 5-10 years these things will be great. Right now, for someone who doesn_ enjoy troubleshooting technology, it_ probably more trouble than it_ worth.",0
3,"Voice Recognition is Terrible
  
",10.Jan.20,Yes,"I've had my two second generation echo dots for about a year and they're fantastic. We got our third generation and we constantly have to repeat ourselves, and even when we do that it doesn't understand us. It's in the exact same location that we used to have one of the older ones, so nothing has changed except the machine itself. In fact, sometimes we raise our voices and it still won't get it right, but one of the second generation dots answers us from another room. I got it as a deal, but I should have stuck with the second generation dots. BOO. HISS.",0
5,"Alexa Dot is small and efficient!!!
  
",10.Jan.20,Yes,"I was very pleased with my purchase of the Alexa Dot. It is small and a perfect fit in my kids rooms. The Alexa dot was also super easy to plug up and instal.The dot can give them weather updates and plays music and even gives them a night sounds - example, rain or birds chirping. It is perfect. The kids are able to call my cell phone and even to Each other through their dots. I was very pleasantly surprised how much i like them.Super happy with the purchase!!",0
2,"I haven't found any use for this thing.
  
",10.Jan.20,Yes,"My house guest uses it to play music, but I haven't found any use for it at all. It hasn't been able to do anything I've asked it to. It couldn't tell me how to connect it to my Fire Stick, I had to go online and figure it out for myself.  It still won't turn it on. It's supposed to be able to connect to my security cameras, but it hasn't managed to do that yet. I really see no use for it.",0
4,"Sound is ok.
  
",10.Jan.20,Yes,"It is a really nice designed speaker. Alexa works well most of the time. The sound is too bass and treble is not great. Even when Alexa talks is too bass. Google home mini has better treble for music and voice. Also is better balance in bass, music is deeper and you can hear the assistant very clear. In general this a good speaker but they need to work more on the sound.",0
5,"Very Pleased!
  
",10.Jan.20,Yes,"I first saw a Echo Dot from my mom and I was always impressed with it.  So this Christmas, I got one of the 3rd Generation Echo Dot and I was just as happy about it as I would have thought!  I usually use my iPad to get quick information, but now if is hardly used any more because the ""Dot"" is so ""smart"" that it replies even quicker!  I would definitely recommend this!",0
5,"It is smarter than me.
  
",10.Jan.20,Yes,"I'm very challenged when it comes to utilizing the full potential of my smart devices. This device is great for listening to music, audible books and games. I dont like that the question of the day has a cost if you go beyond 7 days. Or that everytime you ask to play a game it directs you to jeopardy. Jeopardy is fun and all, but it would be nice to have it mention other games. The song challenge game is fun.",0
