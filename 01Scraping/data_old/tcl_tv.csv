5,"Good buy.
  
",5.Nov.18,No,"Arrived on time and package was in excellent shape. Got it out of boxes and set it up. Sit up as computer monitor, but also like that it can be used as a TV, with wireless connection. Great picture quality, good sound. Was an easy set up and connection.",42
3,"BROKEN REMOTE
  
",23.Nov.18,Yes,"The TV Arrived in good working order but the remote does not work. We changed the batteries but it still doesn't work. We have a 43"" TCL so we are able to operate it and also have access to the phone ap. But it is disappointing to get a broken remote. The TV was already hung on the wall when we discovered that the remote doesn't work So it's too much of a pain to send the whole TV back. If someone sends me a working remote I will update this review.",14

2,"Remote problem
  
",1.Dec.18,Yes,"Very reasonable value, but I can't get the remote to communicate with the tv.  There is a clear piece of plastic on the bottom of the tv in the center.  Is that supposed to be removed?  Customer support is not available on the weekend.",5

5,"So far so GOOD
  
",4.Dec.18,Yes,I purchased this TV for my college age son and so far it working really well. Easy set up and he plans to use it as a monitor with his desktop computer.,1
5,"Wonderful Budget-Friendly TV!
  
",8.Dec.18,Yes,"The television itself should have higher reviews, but faulty reviews and pre-broken TV's (which is more of a shipping fault) shouldn't be considered accurate because once you recieve a working television, then its great! Great sound and picture for $230!",1

",10.Dec.18,Yes,"This is a great tv for the cost with a clear picture,easy set up and easy use.",0
5,"Great features
  
",12.Dec.18,Yes,Bought this for a kitchen TV and it is an impressive piece for the price. Setting it up I was prompted to insert a usb stick to enable up to 90 minutes ff or rewind on antenna tv very cool. Roku OS is a perfect compliment to my stand alone Roku I like it.,0
4,"Not bad. Not great
  
",15.Dec.18,Yes,"Great picture. As a seasoned Roku veteran I can say this unit operates about 98% flawlessly. 1080p works great. My only complaint is the Netflix app on this platform is terrible. Even on a 1Gig internet connection with a fast wireless mesh network, the app is slow, pokey, and mildly irritating. The spectrum app is similarly slow and pokey, but does playback without buffering. Every other app works perfectly though. The remote is a bit of a bear, in that it shows somewhat mild latency in control inputs.  If I had to do it again, I would probably just buy the Samsung 32 1080p tv and use the embedded app hub. Another let down was the remote lacks a headphone jack. The other roku platforms offer a headphone jack on the remote.",4
5,"Good Tv
  
",15.Dec.18,Yes,Like it good quality pocture,0
5,"Great buy for the money!
  
",16.Dec.18,No,"I was looking for a smaller TV for a bedroom.  Setup was fairly easy.  None of the 32 inch TVs have a phenomenal picture, but this is probably on par with any of the more expensive brands.  The Roku system gives you TONS of content for free.  I_ truly impressed!",0
5,"Great Value
  
",16.Dec.18,Yes,"My last tv was this same brand and I loved it! This new one is super thin, great picture quality and a wonderful value. I highly recommend if you are looking to upgrade your tv.",2
5,"Great TV and an even better price.
  
",18.Dec.18,Yes,So far I am loving this product. I have it on the TV stand that moves so I can move it anywhere around my workout room as long as it reaches the plug the Wi-Fi seems to be very strong and can play all my streaming apps.,0
5,"Good so far
  
",18.Dec.18,Yes,Works great so far.,0
5,"Bizzarre but nice
  
",21.Dec.18,Yes,"No numbers to select channels on the Roku remote. If you have only an antenna, I can't imagine how you change channels! Maybe just up and down, and you won't have that many channels. No luck with programming a Harmony 650, but luckily my Uverse S-10 series remote works perfectly. I can switch back and forth between Roku functions and the cable box, control the sound, power, etc. Picture and sound are very good. Pleased for the price.",5
5,"Work good
  
",23.Dec.18,Yes,Work good i  also Recommend buying amazon fire tv stick when buying this tv,0
5,"Day 1 = Very Happy
  
",25.Dec.18,Yes,"Had this only a day, so cannot speak to longevity.  Picture is perfect, setup is a breeze, Roku works as it should, 3 HDMI inputs at this price is solid.  TV is super light and low profile.  Sound seems ok, but didn't really test for that - my son uses it mostly to play video games with headphones.If you haven't used Roku, that deserves a 6th star for this price point.  It's a great operating system for a TV and the updated Spotify feature is outstanding.  A new feature I just found is with the Roku app on your phone, you can toggle to private listening and have all audio come through your phone (which also means to any earbuds, etc., hooked up to the phone).  Great stuff.",4
5,"Surprisingly great tv
  
",25.Dec.18,Yes,This is the second one I bought because I was so pleased.Easy to install. Easy to use. Great value for the price,0
2,"Volume
  
",27.Dec.18,Yes,You have to turn the volume to 50% or more to hear the programs. Not at all satisfied with this product. I ordered a sound bar if that doesn_ make a considerable difference I am sending it back.,2
5,"Great Little TV
  
",28.Dec.18,Yes,"This TV was bought for the bedroom and serves its purpose quite well.  It is a different TV from any we have ever had in that it works with tiles and because we want local news, etc. we still needed to hook up our cable box to the TV.  I was hoping to eliminate the cable box in the bedroom.  The remote is quite small and took some getting used to.  Overall you can't beat the price for this quality of a TV.",2

",2.Jan.19,Yes,"I was pleasantly surprised with this TV. Normally I'm skeptic to try a new brand, but it was reviewed highly on the net. Turns out it's not a bad TV at all. 1080p, Roku built in. It's used in my teen kids room for his PS4 and he loves it. Sound is a bit on the low end, it has a super bass setting that does super nothing lol, but it don't sound horrible. We have had it for a few weeks now, I will edit if anything changes for the worse.",1
2,"Netflix hangs on this TV
  
",3.Jan.19,Yes,It hangs with Netflix. If you want to use Netflix do not use this very bad TV . And even you cannot restart or shutdown the TV when Netflix hangs !!!,23
4,"Really good tv for the price. Switches between apps very quickly.
  
",6.Jan.19,No,"I bought this tv for my sister for Christmas and it surprised me. Now take this with a grain of salt because we just got it but, it is working great so far. The picture is really good. The tv changes between apps and channels quickly. The tv also allows you to record up the last 30 mins( I think it's 30 mins) of live tv if you have a usb hard drive attached. For the price, it is a great choice. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I don't know how long the tv will last. I bought the 4 year replacement warranty just in case. I would suggest to do the same.",0
5,"Great picture and sound!
  
",6.Jan.19,Yes,So far so good! Perfect size for my living room. Great picture and sound.,0
4,"Definitely on par with my other TCL TV's .. great Picture and ease of use.!
  
",7.Jan.19,Yes,"First off .. and, should pretty much go without saying.. TV's today need the External speaker system of your choice, period. So, I never even tried it without some connected.My only surprise really was that this set seems a bit slow on connecting to my home network.. Seems that my other TCL's (all 1080p or 4k) pretty well connect quickly.  I held out on replacing my bedroom TV since I wasn't going to put in a 32"" that was only 720p hd .. This one is 1080p and ticks all my requirements.  Once it's connected, it's great.  Oh, and giving it a dedicated high-speed flash drive allowing for pausing live TV.. Wonderful.  That was a little bonus I hadn't originally thought to be important but, it's come in handy several times.. nice.  I still think TCL makes some super value TV's and this being now my 4th RokuTV after using lots of Roku boxes in the past.. yep. Very nice.",19

",7.Jan.19,No,This is the second TCL that stopped working in last 2 years. Just called there support line and wait time is  60 minutes.,0
4,"Great TV, Poor Sound
  
",8.Jan.19,Yes,"I have a smaller TCL TV and the sound is much better than this one. This one is pretty bad to the point where we have to get a sound bar to listen to music or watch movies without straining. The ones with the TV go loud but not clear, like old TV's that lack bass etc.",3
3,"Refresh Rate 60Hz or 120Hz?
  
",8.Jan.19,Yes,"I just received the TV,  TCL Roku 32S325, still in the box and right on the box it says 60hz.  Yet in the specs online it says this model is supposed to be 120hz.  I'm only giving this 3 Stars to start as it seems deceiving.  I'm sure the TV will be fine and for our viewing I don't think we would notice between 60 or 120.  I just want to know where the mix up is?",2
5,"Great for cutting the cord

3,"The screen glows at night! (in a pitch black room)
  
",24.Jan.19,Yes,"We bought this TV for our bedroom, somewhere we rarely watch TV. At night, the screen would glow faintly. The glow is not noticeable in the day or if there is any light in the room. But, if you wake up in the middle of the night, you will see the entire screen of the TV with a glow.The issue here is that I worked with TCL support to absolute zero resolution. They continued to ask for a photo of the glowing screen. The glow WOULD NOT show up in a photo because it was too dark. It was only noticeable to the human eye in the pitch black room - a camera could not capture it. Rather than offering to replace the TV or try to replicate it in their lab, they continued to ask for a picture.I finally sent them a picture of the TV in the dark (the photo looked completely black, but they asked for it?). I also sent them a photo of the TV in the day (they asked for a photo of the TV). After I sent these pictures and reiterated, once again, that the glow could not be captured on camera, they asked for a photo again.TCL said they could not replicate the issue in their lab (I doubt they tried). I sent the TV back to Amazon as defective. I will not be buying another TCL again.",15

5,"Terrific Picture Quality, Awesome Interface
  
",28.Jan.19,Yes,"This TV is outstanding. I own 5 of these and am very impressed with the picture quality and overall ease of use. I own fire sticks, roku sticks and even an older chromecast, and the Roku Smart TV is far easier to use than any 2 remote control configuration like you have with the add on roku's or fire sticks. The remote has only a few simple buttons and the main menu you see when you turn on the TV is super intuitive and very easily customizable.I hate having 2 remotes or having to explain to a guest how to work the remote for my TV. With this TV the user interface is terrific , the picture quality is fantastic and even the sound is better than I expected for this price point. I previously purchased Vizio's but the interface on those was far more limited and they were returned. I don't do reviews often but these TV's are worth the time and definitely get 5 Stars from me.",2
5,"Nice TV
  
",29.Jan.19,Yes,"Bought this to replace an LG 32 inch. Going from 32 to 49 major improvement. The TV was very simple to setup, great picture, sounds great and you cannot beat the price. Arrived on time and in perfect condition. WIFI is strong, the menus highly responsive, you cannot go wrong. ITs 1080p but thats what I wanted, 4k is overrated makes everything look like a video. Love it!",0
3,"Great TV for the price!
  
",30.Jan.19,Yes,"The TV is great for the price and If you're a roku fan It's great. The only problem I have is that it's only 35.5 inches and not the true size. That seems to be the case with a  lot of LED TVs, There are plenty of other TVs with true size. Also the speakers aren't very great. Seems like most TV manufacturers try to focus on bigger TVs for low price without hampering the quality of TV, They usually tend to over look the sound because customers are more concerned with cheaper, bigger, good picture. Sure there are Better TVs out there for a few more bucks, But for your simple Needs this is a great value.",0

From that point forward I could not get my DirectTV remote to work with the TV, it would not recognize my Samsung sound system like it did before. Did several factory resets, new quality HDMI Cables and no go. You pay for what you get this TV is less than 6 months old. It is awkward to setup with the WIFI, though after about 5 factory resets I could do this in my sleep. Do not buy. If you do remember that you pay for what you get.",1

",10.Feb.19,Yes,"Upgrading from a 32"" TV because cable shows local broadcasts in 'windowbox' (black box all around). Hooked up BluRay/DVD and had minor sound issue (doesn't seem to support Dolby Atmos only Dolby D - have to see if it passes through like the 32"" after I get my soundbar hooked up). Setup Screensaver but doesn't seem to work except in Home (Prime goes to blank after 5 minutes, then to Home/Screensaver after 15 minutes, then shuts down after 5 minutes). Hooked up the cable ""digital adapter"" and got a 38"" picture for Superbowl. Prime menu is quite different than my Fire Stick TV. Overall,  great picture and sound.",4

",18.Feb.19,No,"i would like to say that this is the most horrible experience I""ve ever had with a television.  It's a little over 2 years old and the picture is breaking up.  Not cable related, not wi fi related, had all that checked, and other TVs in the house have no problems.  Also, I hate the way it resets your ""favorites"" - who the hell asked you to?  I even reset to factory settings because was told that it would redo that particular stupid function, so I went through the whole setup again, and now, a few weeks later, same stupid thing happened.  It takes - what it thinks - are your most watched channels and lines them up, so if you want to watch another channel once in a while, you have to go through 100s of channels to get to the one they don't think is important to you.  I called Costco, they told me no warranty left.  Called the credit card company, I would have to pay to have a repair company come and check it to make sure it can't be ""repaired"" - but I just want to get rid of this piece of junk now.  NEVER AGAIN TLC!!!",0

",20.Feb.19,Yes,"I bought the 43 inch TCL/Roku TV three years ago.

In the end I gave up and contacted the warranty people for repair. They actually refunded what I paid originally paid for the TV. I have had the new, 2018, model for about a month and sure enough, the same problem appears - sounds cuts out and I have to unplug it and plug it back in to fix the problem. Three years apart yet the same problem. I wish I had paid attention to the reviews and left TCL TVs well alone. Never again.",16

",3.Mar.19,Yes,"Fantastic tv, for the low price could not be more pleased.  Whether watching streamed content or a blu-ray dvd from the library, the picture on this 49"" set is outstanding.  Any worries about not spending more for a name-brand 4K set were put to rest in the first hour of use.  I sit about 8 to 10 feet back and am pretty fussy about picture quality &amp; sound.As far as connecting to either an antenna (not included, they're about $15) for local stations or online content from netflix, amazon, etc, it's very simple to use compared to the (very capable &amp; good for it's day) 2010 37"" Panasonic lcd tv it replaced.  Remote control is very easy to use, controls are streamlined to the most relevant functions, for me anyway.  The sound quality is probably adequate for many people, dialog is generally easy to hear, but as you'd expect from a slim tv, there's no real bass or fullness to the sound.  Not complaining, I plan on hooking it up to my hi-fi system.",1
4,"nice tv
  
",4.Mar.19,Yes,"Received the tv and set it up. Worked great for a week, but then the remote stopped working. I did not realize that the tv does not have any buttons to operate the tv without the remote. I tried reseting the tv (which I believe disconnected it from my internet connection), and still could not get it to work. After that I downloaded the app to use as a remote but it would not connect, because I think when I re-set the tv it disconnected from the internet, therefore I could not get the app to connect to the tv. So it was pretty much useless without a remote. Called customer service and they are sending one, but over a week later and I am still waiting. I like the TV, but wasn't impressed that with how fast I had issues with the remote and how slow the service is, especially since it is useless without a remote. Hopefully when I get a new remote it will work flawlessly. The tv itself seems nice. Good picture, good price, good feeatures with the built in roku and channel options.",1

Bought my husband a 55 inch for Christmas and we liked the brand so well we bought another one for our kids' playroom when we saw it on sale. Great picture unless you want a super fast refresh rate and the sound is much better at higher volumes. Nice, affordable TV that functions well for the average person. The smart TV portion is very user-friendly as well.",1

Now I researched these tv to find the best and in the end this was my choice if that is correct or not who knows. NOW, the only issues I have with the tv are 1.) The sound I have a 32 in roku sharp tv and it's super load can't get it past bar 8 without people complaining. Now this tv is quiet The perfect sound being a 22.

",6.Mar.19,Yes,We bought this TV to replace our previous TV. We really liked the price and were satisfied with the reviews.  The only trouble was the TV was originally supposed to come on Wednesday but we received an email saying it would be delivered on Thursday.  Somehow we were not informed that this had  again changed and it was delivered on Wednesday when we were not at home.  Fortunately we came home early from an appointment to find our very large TV box sitting in plain view of the street on our doorstep.The TV itself is wonderful.  It was easy to put the legs on the TV and set the TV up with all the settings we had on our previous Roku.  The picture is so clear we didn't have to adjust any settings and the sound was great even over our washing machine.  We would definitely purchase this TV again.,1
5,"Great TV - Not great Customer Service
  
",7.Mar.19,Yes,"I bought 2, 50 inch TCL TVs and 1, 32 inch TCL TV. I had all three professionally installed. The TVs look great, the picture is sharp and clear, the sound is good, I especially like the built-in Roku box, and the price is amazing. One of the TVs came with a bad remote, and the technician who installed it told me to ask Amazon for a replacement. Amazon doesn't have replacement remotes, so I was referred to the manufacturer. The gentleman at TCL customer service wanted to trouble shoot this remote before he would replace it. I explained to him that I hired a professional, because I cannot do things like that. Bottom line is that without trouble shooting to try to make the remote work, TCL will not replace it. I called the technician that installed the TVs and he is going to call TCL to explain about the remote, but if he has to come to my house to trouble shoot, I am sure I am going to have a service charge that may be more than the cost of the TV! What is crazy is that if I was able to take the TV off the wall mount, packaged it up and returned it to Amazon they would replace the whole TV! All I want is a replacement remote!  TCL is very short sighted not to give better customer service. It tarnishes personal opinion about a good product at a reasonable price.",2

To use them, you have to use the Roku app on your smartphone which chews up your battery time. In 33 minutes, it drained 15%. Also be advised that Amazon shipped mine using USPS! I live in an apartment with clearly marked buzzers &amp; they didn't even ring, just left it in the common area where anyone could've taken it... and the 'delivered' notification didn't show up until an hour later.

",15.Mar.19,Yes,"I rarely write reviews and benefit regularly from them: THANK YOU to all of you who take the time to let us know how you rate your purchase.  Amazon is awesome.  I bought TCL 32S327 32-Inch 1080p to put in front of my treadmill in the basement: tired of using my tablet.  I mounted it on my wall with Mounting Dream TV Wall MD2380 and I couldn't be more pleased.  The WiFi signal (from about 50 feet away, upstairs) reaches great (as it did for my tablet: which I worried about).  The set up was a breeze.  Note: at first I couldn't find the volume control on the remote.  It drove me nuts until I realized the volume up down buttons are on the SIDE of the remote (phones do that, not remotes: at least, so I thought).Also good to note, I did have to create a Roku account, but it didn't cost anything.  They use the account to keep track of which apps you want on the device.  I only have Netflix and Amazon Prime videos, and so far they are both working great.  I highly recommend this TV.  Oh, an added bonus is that Roku has an app that allows remote control from your smart phone.  If I want to listen via headphones (if I don't want to wake anyone up) I can plug the headphones into my smartphone and listen from there.  This prevents me from having to get to the back of the TV to plug in the headphones there (which is what I was originally planning on doing).I literally just installed this TV last night and haven't had a chance to see it in action.  But all my testing has been very pleasing.  I will update this review later if my experience is any different.",15
5,"Good TV for the price!
  
",15.Mar.19,Yes,"The picture is great. The TV is perfect size. The only downfall, is the remote control. You have to aim it at a certain spot to get it to recognize. Still, can't beat the price, and easy set up!",0

",16.Mar.19,Yes,I've only had this TV for couple of weeks but shipping was great...no damages...on time...the TV itself is 1080 p.....which is what I wanted because my internet speed isn't that fast ...streams beautiful.... love the Roku remote and couldn't be easier to set up....I'm pleased if anything new arises...I'll update review!,1
4,"Great TV, great operating system, terrible remote
  
",17.Mar.19,Yes,"I bought this TV for our living room so we could quickly access the content we wanted with a single remote. This accomplishes that! I also have a Roku and a 32"" TV in another room that works great, but requires one remote for the tv/volume and one for the Roku.My initial impression of this TV is that it feels cheap. The feet are solid and the screen is good quality, but the remote is super lightweight and plastic feeling. Compared with the Roku remote, it's really not a great feel. It works well for what it is, but I prefer to control the TV with the Roku app on my phone. I can't complain about the TV because it's super affordable, but the remote is frustrating. If I hadn't ever used a Roku before I probably wouldn't have been as frustrated. My Roku is not line-of-sight dependent for the remote. This TV is. It feels like an add exclusion and definitely affects the Roku experience.",1
5,"I'm not a teevee-o-phile
  
",17.Mar.19,Yes,"we've been using our first non-tube teevee, also a TCL, since 2011. The boss at work bought ten or so of these 43 inch ones to use as monitors recently, and everyone liked them. They were cheap then, when I saw that their price had been lowered again, I couldn't resist. I love this teevee. In the past I've tried both roku and firetv... I like the firetv and so I plugged my firestick into one of the hdmi ports and use it instead of the built-in roku, works great.",1

",18.Mar.19,Yes,"This TV is well worth the price and is actually a bargain. I am still very surprised at the low price.

No problems with tv the couple months I've had it.",0

",22.Mar.19,Yes,"After carefully reading the product reviews, we decided to take a chance on this television. The price was so low, we even went for the extended service contract, just in case. We were so pleased at how much lighter it is than our previous unit, and was very straightforward to attach to our mounting brackets. My minor complaint would be the short cord length, but otherwise, setup was a breeze. Picture quality is very good. We are extremely happy with our purchase.",1

",24.Mar.19,Yes,"No, this isn't going to be some funny review about not being able to sleep because you've got your TV on in the bedroom. ;) I wish it were. But I can't sleep with the TV on, otherwise the bright white light at the bottom of the TV (when it's turned off) wouldn't bother me. This light also doubles as a sensor so you can't block it. I have temporarily placed my girl scout cookie box in the way of the brightness.. which makes me hungry for cookies, pretty sure that's a win for me. I'm going to go make some ice cream coffee now. :) Cheers",2

",29.Mar.19,Yes,"So far so good.  We are absolute morons when it comes to technology, but we liked the TV so much we bought a second one.  We got it going easily for cable TV.  Now we have to figure out how to use our voice remote and use it for other things, which may not be so easy, but initial set up was a breeze.  The only complaint I have is that the picture does not fill the entire screen of the TV.  Maybe we didn't do something right, but the screen is plenty big.  I'm thrilled to have my old ""unsmart"" TV's gone.  We gave them away to our neighbors.  Now we have the capability of so much more, once we figure out how.  I'm very happy the initial set up was idiot-proof.  The picture and sound are fabulous.  I recommend these televisions to other idiots.  You cannot beat the price.  The ""feet"" are a little cheap looking, but no one is going to look at the feet.  We had to put one of the TV's on a two by four and clamp the feet to it to prevent it tipping over as it was too large for the bureau it went on top of.  When we rearrange our bedroom we will move it to something larger.  We are very pleased so far!",1

",5.Apr.19,Yes,"At first, I bought the 32"" of this product, which is the same size as the old 2009 TV I replaced for above my workbench.  It was advertised as (2) 5-watt speakers for 10w total.  Since my old 32-inch was also 10w, I thought that would be plenty loud enough, but it was only a small fraction of the max volume.  So I returned it for the 40"", which is advertised as (2) 8-watt speakers for 16w, and it's a little louder but still, not even close to the max volume of my old 10w TV.  Not sure how they're measuring the volume speaker wattage, but I'm currently watching everything with subtitles on just so I can understand what's being said.  I guess I'll be forced to buy an additional soundbar.  Other than that, the picture is good, the roku works great, and my only other issue is that the remote MUST be aimed DIRECTLY at the receiver - just 10 or 15-degrees off and nothing happens.",1

5,"See pictures: Perfect TV for a non-theater type home setup. Simple and intuitive with a nice picture
  
",7.Apr.19,Yes,"This TCL 40-inch TV offers a great solution for most casual home setups.  We have put it in our closet like armoire that had been previously accommodating a fifteen year old standard definition 42"" plasma TV. That old plasma had been handed down from our family room a few years ago when we upgraded.  The problem was, it required we keep an extra cable box setup in our bedroom at a cost of $11/month.  Since we infrequently use the bedroom TV it did not make financial sense to keep the cable setup and as a result we sacrificed a usable TV.  This TV was a reasonable investment whose upfront cost would offset the cable box setup in a little over a year.  We also now have Netflix, Youtube, Amazon Music and many broadcast channels from the internal antenna jack and all the app channels we care to add on (ESPN, News, etc).The installation was simple and required nothing but another device with an internet connection to verify connections/logins (I used my iPhone).  The remote control is simple to use and the TV's interface is simple to navigate.  For a simple home setup, this TV is perfect; with its nice HD picture, simple interface, reasonable price and internal speakers.  This was well worth the purchase for our needs and I would recommend this TV for all but those looking to use it as part of some glorious theater setup.  Should any issues develop as time goes on I will update.  A picture is attached for reference.",13

5,"Superb Roku TV!!!
  
",11.Apr.19,Yes,"Wow!  This TV really works wonders for my entertainment center.  In crystal-clear 1080p quality, this TV comes preset with a built-in Roku menu.  The option to change the picture settings while watching a channel (i.e. Netflix, VUDU), I was able to make the TV look even better.  Furthermore, I was able to free up an HDMI port (since I had my old Roku Stick plugged into it).  Now, I can plug in another gaming machine for my room!  Overall, a very accommodating TV... with a few issues...The issues I would have is that the TV takes a while to set up.  This is the least of the problems (unless you don't have WIFI).  Second, setting up all the subscription channels can also take up a bit of time (depending on the channel).  The TV also feels a bit flimsy (possibly from being lightweight); however, once attached to the stands, it shouldn't be too much of a problem.  Lastly, I have noticed that TCL had removed the ""Expert Picture Mode"" from their Roku apps.  This was a bit disappointing, since I'm not able to adjust the RGB colors, noise reduction, and certain gamma aspects.  While the TV picture can be adjusted, the lack of the previously mentioned settings prevent me from tweaking it even further.In conclusion, the TCL 32S327 32-Inch TV is great and I highly recommend it!!!  :D",2

",25.Apr.19,Yes,"I love my new TV!  Quite a change from my 12 year old 19. I found it easy to set up ( no scammers for me) and was surprised by how light and easy to maneuver it was. (I don_ have it mounted, just used the enclosed _egs.). There are only two things that are less than perfect for me. On the remote the sound level/ mute button is on the side and I often manage to turn off the tv or change channels while reaching for the volume button  not a big deal, I just need to be less clumsy. The other is that the Roku does not have (at least, I haven_ found) the function of reducing the resolution to less than HD. Since I am in a rural area with horribly slow internet, this is a drawback. My solution is to run streaming through my kindle fire where I can reduce resolution, then screen mirror to the TV. It took a while to find the screen mirroring function, but it is there!  And truthfully, it looks just as good as HD and doesn_ buffer so much. I have been able to find an answer to any question by googling the name of the TV and whatever I want to do.  I really like this TV.",1

1,"Please read Before Purchasing this specific model
  
",30.May.19,Yes,"I am a huge fan of TCL and their TV's until I bought this one. Their tech support could be much better.There is an issue with the TV's software that affects the remote control once a network is configured. The only way I can get to have a working remote (without using the APP on a smartphone) is by not configuring the network at all. I been battling TCL  and loosing on this issue for about 3 weeks now. I even had Amazon ship me a new TV, same model, only to have the same exact issue.My rub with support is that I need to ship the TV to them at my expense. They would ship me a replacement one once they receive mine. And because they are just following a process the New TV will likely have the same issue.Here is a short summary:he issue: Once the TV is configured, the TV IR remove becomes unresponsive. (prior to configuration, IR Remote works as expected)I looked at the environment where I had the TV placed, covered up some large mirrors, removed anything that could possibly interfere with the IR. No go same issueTried multiple TCL remotes (I had 3 of them) with new fresh batteries. No go same issueIf I use the Roku app on my Cell phone, I am able to use and navigate functions as expected, but then again not really using IR and this is not the preferred method of usage.Performed factory reset, Remote back responsive. Walked through the configuration this time I SKIPPED connecting to any WiFi network.  NO Issues with the remote Everything works as expected.Once the TV was up I configured the Wireless/Internet network successfully and registered the . This caused the remote to NOT function again.I connected to a different WiFi/Intenet network (Phone Hotspot) to rule out infrastructure components.  This caused the remote to NOT function again.Also Note that Once I successfully configured Wifi/Internet, whether there was the connections was active or inactive, this caused the remote not to function again.At this time, I did not connect the TV to any network so the remote is working; however this defeats the purpose of having a smart-TV.

",12.Jun.19,Yes,"Ok, I admit along with the others, the remote leaves a lot to be desired. But the work arounds include a ROKU app download that includes voice activated commands. The set up can be a bit confusing for those not accustomed to the features it offers. However, you do NOT have to input any credit card information and if you go slow, you can get through it easily enough without any calls to an 800 number. Since I already have Netflix, HBO, Showtime and Amazon Prime, I was able to activate all of those accounts by syncing them with my cable service and installing the apps using the voice prompt. Example, I used the app voice feature and spoke ""HBO"" The TV asked if I wanted to install it and I used the up down arrow to say yes on the TV. It then gave me an activation code and the HBO website location to type in the code. Easy enough. The TV is lightweight and the stand legs are a bit on the small side, but I don't have kids, cats or dogs that will present a problem. I live in Florida and this will be outside on my deck and screen enclosure. I easily hooked up wireless TV headphones so I can enjoy it outside without disturbing the neighbors when I watch the news in the morning.

",21.Jun.19,Yes,"I saw prior to ordering that this TV is noted for being somewhat fragile.  Sure enough, despite handling it with great care, upon power up it was quite apparent that the screen was badly shattered.  Front glass was intact.  Damage was only visible on power up where the screen's backlighting shone thru the damaged area.  Immediately contacted Amazon and got the replacement unit less that 24 hrs later.The second unit arrived intact, and has been quite impressive.  Great picture, and better sound than we expected for such a small TV.  We already have a Roku stick on one of our TVs, but this TV with Roku integrated into it is far faster in Roku menus and program selection.  We use it on the patio for baseball games and occasional TV watching, where it has been a big hit.  Was pleasantly surprised to find our entire Spectrum Cable channel line-up was available as an app on the Roku menu, meaning we can watch TV  over wifi, without a cable connection.Only negative might be if you aren't or don't want to be a Roku customer.  Signing into Roku or becoming a new Roku customer is pretty a much mandatory first step before using the TV.  You do not have to register a credit card to do this, though this will speed up any later purchases.",2

However I gave this a one star rating because of the offensive, manipulative and utterly unavoidable hidden marketing scheme that one must succumb to in order to watch the TV.  I am probably going to return the TV because of the below.It was impossible to set up the regular cable tv without the follow intrusive tactics:One must open the Roku app on the phone and give personal information.One must agree that that information is shared widely as Roku chooses.Though not mandatory one is asked to provide credit card account information (I bypassed this)One must wade through a labyrinth of marketing offersEvery time the tv is turned on one must pass through an extra step which is the Roku option screen.Had I known about all of this in advance I never would have purchased the TV!So, be warned and beware!!",13
1,"Falsely advertised as 120hz. Do not buy.
  
",23.Jun.19,Yes,"Turns on fast, setup takes ages because they want you to tell it where exactly it is in your house and attach a Roku account. Also, it states that it's 120hz but it isn't. It only supports 60hz. I spoke with their support and they tried to blame my RX580. Only 3HDMI ports and a single adapter slot for Composite. No DisplayPort it anything. Picture is clear but the darks tend to glow.",2

4,"Good value for a TV!
  
",24.Jun.19,Yes,"Originally I purchased the 720p version of this TV sold here, because my old 10+ year 720p store brand TV I bought from Best Buy so long ago finally gave out. I actually really liked that TV and it worked well for a desktop PC that I rarely use. I figured I didn't need to splurge for the 1080p version of this TV since the smaller resolution was perfectly fine for the few times I use my desktop PC. Unfortunately I realized when I hooked up the 720p version, the PC's resolution was actually 1080p, and it was showing through a 720p monitor... long story short, it looked very bad and I realized I had to return it and splurge for the 1080p option. Quick review of the 720p one: Great quality overall, I actually really liked the viewing angles and picture quality of that. I think it would make for a great TV, however for a PC it made the text a bit choppy and difficult to read, so I don't recommend it as that. The same day, I went and ordered this 1080p version. It is designed slightly differently but overall looks the same. Resolution is much better, makes everything on my PC look normal again. I am pretty disappointed with the viewing angles and brightness. The TV is almost darker around the edges. It almost looks like it fades into the edges, which is very strange. Viewing angles are atrocious, but part of that could be attributed to the strange darkness around the edges. Screen is pretty bright, in general for a budget TV I'm happy. But oddly enough the screen on my very old TV that I was using before almost seemed better. Let's just hope I get another 10+ years use out of this one!The setup was very, very easy. It tries to make you register for a Roku account however look carefully at all your options, you can choose to ignore the setup (it was completely unnecessary for me) and go straight to using it as a computer monitor. The setup however is pretty easy and self explanatory. The ""smart"" aspect of this TV works well, it's not laggy at all like other smart TVs I have (though they are older as well). I would totally suggest getting this if you plan on using it as an actual TV. As a PC monitor it's alright, but I can't help but feel like since you're looking at it closer up when as a PC monitor, it might be better to spend a little more for a better brand with a better quality panel. This here gets the job done but I'm not wowed. Another pro is that it is VERY, very light. I was shocked at how light it was. Definitely not what I'm used to from my older flat screen TVs!",2

3,"TV works great.. when it feels like it
  
",25.Jun.19,Yes,"Pros: the picture quality is good, very little buffering once the shows start playing, volume is decent, decent price for the size and what you get.Cons: the remote is absurdly small and constantly gets lost. There is an app available, but that rarely connects with my TV, so that doesnt work. Also, I wish the remote has a slide out keyboard like old cellphones because typing can be annoying eith the remote (especially considering connection issues with the app).My main issue with the TV is the constant connection issues. It frequently needs to reestablish connection to my internet and go through all the prompts to do this before loading different apps. This problem has become much more frequent since the purchase of the TV. This is also especially annoying for HBO because HBO will require that I activate the tv every time with a phone or computer, so it takes several minutes to even get to an app to get to a show. This happens when my internet is not having any other connective issues.",1

If you expect the TV to be instant to react to every type of user interfacing then this TV will drive you mad, its so slow at times I had a second one sent to me because I though the first was defective.  The remote that comes with it is problematic as it fails to send signals fast clean and reliability.I almost returned it and if not for the ROKU Phone apps voice control I would have.  The phone app is nice but a voice remote with buttons is better.  The feature that impressed me the most is switching HDMI inputs via voice remote and it's super easy, just press the button say what the HDMI input is named and it switches.  The downside of voice remote is sometimes when voice searching it immediately after an input  its says ""installing (name of channel) and you can't stop it from installing and have to remove it later if you didn't want it or will just switch to Pandora if you have it. I also once had a brief problem with voice search hard to explain exactly the nature of it but I believe it was internet issues related (no issues with my  internet at the time)I went to ROKU's websight and ordered the voice remote ""for all ROKU TV's"" for 30 bucks plus tax and shipping.  Besides the voice feature its not a line of sight remote but uses radio waves so you can be in another room and control the TV.",2

",20.Jul.19,Yes,"OK so I go this on prime day and it came early and the box was in good shape... always a plus. 720p 32inch $100. I was a bit worried about the 720p picture quality over the 1080p but IM CHEAP and you cant beat that price! That being said im totally impressed with this TV. There are plenty of smart settings that will let you create a plentifully beautiful image so that put to rest my 720 fears. The remote is clever and give you the access to EVERYTHING you could possibly want to stream! I had no idea how many options there are out there.The feature I was by far the most surprised about was the SOUND. The speakers are plenty loud, clean, and will  efficiently balance the voices so you dont have to worry about that obnoxious thing where battle scenes are loud but the voices are muddy and hard to hear so you turn it up only to get BLASTED by the next loud scene and your wife yells at you to turn it down/up/down§¨!  I was going to get some external speakers for it but I really dont think I need to anymore. Not sure why they dont show this off on their page, I sure would.In conclusion... I am totally pleased with this purchase. The size, price, quality, features all make for an easy, solid, would purchase again 5/5 stars. The only thing that could hurt this score is longevity, which if something happens I will return to this  review like a bat out of hell! But until then this was a.................................

",25.Jul.19,Yes,"I can't say enough about this Roku-enabled TCL flatpanel televsion. Great value,e xcellent performance, fine picture quality, no brainer to set up and use. Half of my watch time  is over-the-air antenna broadcast, about 40 percent internet streaming, and 10 percent DVD disk via HDMI input. This Roku TLC unit does all three very nicely. Had it for six months now and everything is as good today as the day I bought it.  I notice the Roku operating spoftware is updated quite regularly , and Roku tech support is excellent. The only criticism is the unusually small plastic legs. I had to secure the feet to the tabletop then use cables to hold the top to the wall ---but only because I have four indoor cats and saw an accident waiting to happen.  The TV could tip over fairly easy. If you use a VESA wall mount, this would not be an issue.  Highly r ecommended, and I looked at many brands before buying the TCL Roku.",1

Comes with A/V adapter that allows me to hook up my very old game consoles with RCA cables.  The main frustration I encountered is that the level of the audio output from the headphone jack to speakers is very low.  The manual says to use this jack for analog speakers.  I am using Bose Companion II speakers which are boomingly loud, yet I have to have the speakers at 75% volume and the TV at 100% volume for just a normal volume level in the small room.  Something is definitely wrong with this.  I have tested the speakers on other devices and the problem is definitely with the TV.  I spent a lot of time in the settings, and researching online to try to resolve this.  I have found this is a common issue with TCL televisions (very low volume output in general, both with the TV's built in speakers and analog as well as optical-out audio).  A TV does two things: shows moving images, and plays sound.  It needs to do both well.  I would have given 5 stars if not for this.  I may end up returning or exchanging.",0

I was only looking for a TV that hooked up my netflix and maybe pandora music in a nice streamlined UI.

At times, all audio went out altogether; and sometimes the ""dings"" would still sound as I navigated the menu options, but none of the apps or Satellite TV had sound.  I researched online to find that several customers were experiencing the same issue.  I tried a few recommended variations on audio and sound settings, but nothing worked permanently.

",1.Sep.19,Yes,"I normally stick to brands I am familiar with, but I thought I would give this tv a chance. The price was great and it's just a replacement for my game room so I figured why not. After setting it up, its a great tv. Picture quality is great, and the menu layout is really nice, the best in my house thus far. I have new and old consoles and this tv lets me create new modes for each console. Its wireless system is great too. I stream Youtube and netflix no issues. After you set up the ROKU account which is free then your set. Took me maybe 5 minutes to set up.If you want a great tv for a low price then this tv will work great.",0
5,"The speakers stopped working after 5 months
  
",2.Sep.19,No,"***Update:I recently switched my internet service and with it came increased bandwidth.  All of the initial problems I was having with this T.V. is no longer an issue and everything is working as it should, including the speakers and sound.  Turns out, the problem was with my internet connection and the signal not being able to penetrate through my walls to reach the room where the T.V. was.  If you've been having similar problems, check your wi-fi connection.I like everything about this T.V. except the speakers stopped working after 5 months.  I now have to unplug and reboot my tv, as well as change the audio settings to something other than what it was on, and then change it back, then turn off/on the tv for the sound to come through.  I'm not sure if this is a glitch with just my unit, but THIS SHOULD NOT BE HAPPENING, especially since I bought this TV in April 2019... it is now the beginning of Sept.  I am very disappointed and quite frankly annoyed that this is happening. Do not waste your money on this piece of junk.",0

",22.Sep.19,No,"Warning. Do not buy this television. We bought a 49 inch TCL television about two months ago. We mounted it in our basement. A week ago we went downstairs and noticed when you turned it on, there was a giant spider crack under the screen. The LCD is obviously busted. We called customer service and they said the warranty doesn't cover it. If it doesn't cover this, what does it cover? Nothing was thrown at the TV, and there are no scratches on the surface. This damage is all underneath the surface. Now we have to pay to recycle the television.",0

",22.Sep.19,Yes,"We got this TV on prime day so we got a good deal but if I would have known how great it was going to be before hand I probably would have just paid full price. We LOVE this tv.

1,"Roku scam
  
",23.Sep.19,Yes,This is a joke. When I started up my TV with my internet on it said I had to go online and put in a code to continue with Roku. When I did it said invalid you must call this number. At this point they told me I could only login to my television with $199 access fee. I cannot even get the cable I had on it unless I turn my internet service off. This is a scam it says at the bottom of the screen when it comes on there is no charge and it is free to connect to this service. Then they sucker you back going through a 20-minute set up and then say now you owe us $199 setup fee. Now with the internet oh I cannot get into my TV to watch my programs. Too late to send my TV back and get a Samsung or something that doesn't scam you. This is a scam. Roku sucks. Have been with Amazon for many years and cannot believe they would let this happen.,1

",9.Oct.19,Yes,"I called TCL within two hours of delivery.  I HATE THE REMOTE.  I am not the only one.  It has a volume control on the side which you easily hit by accident (if right-handed), and there are 4 quick buttons at the bottom that are always live for netflix, hulu, roku and espn.  These will ALWAYS take you somewhere even when you do not have accounts.  You cannot reprogram them.  You cannot disable them.  If you google reprogramming you will find a lot of annoyed people who actually remove the button and fill it in to stop it from being so annoying.  This is particularly annoying when other roku-tv-remotes have other choices (such as Amazon).  TCL says that they have no other (eg. aftermarket universal) remote recommendations.  They did however help me to set up the page I want to see when the tv first comes on (it doesn't have to be the home page that is cluttered with all the stuff you don't have).Mechanically, the tv seems great.  The picture is very sharp and clear -- better than the Vizio tv it replaces although both had the same resolution.  That tv was 8 years old and just kep getting dumber and dumber (no you tube, no skype) and then eventually all the hdmi ports stopped working.  So I am happy with the tv, and thrilled with the price, but the remote is a deal-breaker for me.",0

",10.Oct.19,Yes,"This tv is exactly what I expected, picture looks great. I use roku exclusively to stream Netflix, Hulu and amazon prime. The only reason I gave four stars instead of five is the remote, which works only after pressing the buttons several times. It_ very frustrating.

2,"Not all it's cracked up to be
  
",12.Nov.19,Yes,"I succeeded in setting up this TV, and it works, but I had trouble with the set-up instructions that use names for assorted connectors I'd never heard of and that matched only a few of the labels on the backs of my other associated appliances. When I looked up those terms on the internet, they'd never heard of some of them, either, so I gave up on the instruction manual and just figured out on my own what seemed like it should be connected to what. That worked. Also, if you have a satellite dish and click on satellite when asked to do so, the TV tells you you don't have one, and the whole set-up process grinds to a halt there. I eventually figured out that you're required to pretend and claim to have an antenna. That's the only way to get this TV to work with a dish. Also, the instructions claim that your package includes an AV input cable adapter. That is not true. I expect you'll pay for one, as I assume I did, but if you actually need it, you're going to have to pay for it again when you buy it from a company that actually carries them. Maybe Amazon? Lastly, I sure do miss those primitive bad old days when all I had was one crummy remote. Now, with this TV's updated technology, I get to use two of them just to tune in a TV program. Maybe that has something to do with owning a purely theoretically imaginary satellite dish. Wouldn't you just love a product you could just plug into the wall and turn on? Now that would be a genuinely impressive technological achievement.",0

Even picking a movie on Netflix is extremely annoying and challenging. It's 2020, how can you sell a product with such a horrible remote.",1
5,"nice quality tv
  
",16.Nov.19,Yes,what a great buy  bought 2 one for living room the other for office everything was perfect,0
4,"Audio delay is annoying
  
",18.Nov.19,Yes,Always having audio delays. They fix themself usually but I wouldn_ know how to fix it if it stayed that way. It_ an issue for a lot of people with this TV so take warning. Otherwise I love it. Hopefully they fix the problem with the audio delay,1
2,"Sent in for repair after 2 months.....
  
",18.Nov.19,Yes,"As a long time user of the Roku, I figured this this would be the best of both worlds, however I_e been plagued with issues since I got it.I_e gone back and forth with customer support over the fact that the tv sensor isn_ responding to commands via remote. TCL suggested I change the batteries in the remote. I reset both the TV and the remote.  When that didn_ work, they sent a new remote. The sensor problem got even worse and after a call with customer support they sent me an email today saying I have to ship the TV back for repair which will take 7-10 business days.... about two weeks total once you include shipping to and from. This is utterly ridiculous. I_ super disappointed that the only solution is to repair the broken _ew TV I purchased a little over two months ago instead of sending an actual new one. If it wasn_ past the 30-day period, I probably could have gotten a full refund and a new TV before this 7-10 repair turnaround time.",1

5,"Great Picture, Great Price
  
",22.Nov.19,Yes,"I was unsure whether I needed the 1080p or if I should go for the cheaper 720p as it was just for my bedroom. I'm happy I paid the extra money for this TV as I can really see a difference between my TV and the 720p my parents have. Based on other reviews, I was worried about the sound quality. People were recommending getting a soundbar or a speaker so I was worried the sound quality would be kind of iffy. It's the opposite however, I have never had any problems with the sound.It arrived on time and with no issues. I have had it for months now and it works perfectly. Plus it's the perfect size and weight to move if necessary. I had an event and was able to easy travel with the TV plus my parents have one of the same size and they use it as a TV they move outside and hook up for the summer. Not wanting to leave it out, they chose the 32 in. and have had no issues desite moving in and out constantly.",1

3,"Monitor flickers on and off in Bright picture mode.
  
",2.Dec.19,Yes,"The monitor flickers on and off if you change the picture settings to Brightest. Basically every few minutes it will go off for a second or so, then go back on again. I googled the issues and looks like it is a common occurrence with these monitors. Sounds like it is an issue with a capacitor.",0
5,"Works Great So Far
  
",3.Dec.19,Yes,"This review is for the 32 1080p version.I was a bit nervous about the negative reviews but I had none of their experiences. These are my thoughts on the issues:Registration and setup: With Cable Internet and a previous Roku account. Setup took seconds and was done through the TV. No calls to make, no fraudulent websites to confuse me.Packaging: Came unharmed. But I can see how damage could happen if a sloppy shipper or warehouse worker mishandled it. The tape around the edges resisted in some spots so, remembering the bad reviews, I was cautious in removing it. Maybe they paid attention to bad reviews because it came off smoothly with no damage to the screen or finish.Remote: Remember, it *is* a Roku remote and they are all a little slow. Personally, I found it slightly more responsive than the remotes for the stand alone Roku. It can be annoying typing in complex passwords though. So if the Roku channel gives you the option to sign in via the computer, it might be less frustrating.Longevity: I_e only had it for a day, so it_ too early to tell.This is my first experience with 1080p and smart TV. Maybe if I owned them previously, I_ be disappointed. But so far, it_ a great product that I got with a Black Friday price.",0

5,"DO NOT hesitate in purchasing!
  
",17.Dec.19,Yes,"First of all.... I HAVE to say that monitors of ANY sort, television or computer, are ALWAYS measured DIAGONALLY for screen size. I have the screen size at 40 inches as depicted in the first image. This was eating at me with reviews that showed the screen being only 35 inches when measured horizontally.Super easy to mount and set up. Weighs next to nothing! Already had a Roku installed in my daughters room before and I needed to replace the television because it was super old and broke, so I decided ""Why not a Roku TV?"" With a second set of hands I had this mounted and working within an hour. We have a second Roku TV in the living room, not sure which brand, but that one has worked flawlessly for two years.Having zero issues with it staying connected, we currently have 600mps through our cable internet router as everyone streams or plays games online. I went ahead and got the fastest speed available solely for this purpose.Picture and sound absolutely blow me away at this price point and I figure if it even lasts a year then I've scored big time. I cannot speak on longevity at this moment obviously, but I am super happy with this purchase!",0
