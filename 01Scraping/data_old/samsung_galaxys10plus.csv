5,"Apple defector and not looking back!
  
",8.Mar.19,No,"I_ a decade-plus iPhone user who finally got tired of the ridiculous pricing scheme with those phones.  I was on the fence about the S10+ but a few things won me over.  First, the price was roughly 40% less than the equivalent Xs Max (taking into account all discounts and specials for both phones).  The design is outstanding.  This is a very attractive phone. I have the prism black.  I initially pondered the prism white but the color shift when illuminated by bright light is a little too pink and purplish for my tastes.  Although I_ not a huge fan of the dual pinhole front cameras, they don_ bother me either.  The dual front cameras and rear cameras were a major part of the reason I went with the S10+ instead of the S10.  The rear cameras are what really sold me on the phone, particularly the wide-angle.  Speed of the Android OS and UI on the Galaxy is not only up to par with iOS but in many cases, seems snappier, especially web browsing.  Honestly, about the only things I think iOS does decidedly better are Animoji and facial recognition.  I stopped using animojis almost immediately after the initial wow factor wore off.  That took less than a day.  I also prefer fingerprint unlocking over facial anyhow.  I never warmed up to facial recognition.  It_ fine for singles and people who don_ share their phone.  But for married users like me who frequently accesses a spouse_ device, it_ much more inconvenient than fingerprint registration.  Samsung has both, along with a PIN option like iOS.  However, Samsung also has other options as well, like drawing a pattern.The last time I attempted to leave the Apple ecosystem, I purchased a Note 8.  It didn_ work because  believe both the timing and phone were wrong.  The Note was overkill coming from iOS and iOS still had a slight UI advantage over Android.  The S10+ feels much more intuitive and easier to use than the Note.  There_ no S pen but I never used it beyond the first day.  The gorgeous screen, snappy OS, insanely nice cameras, enhanced security, pocket-friendly price and numerous other nice features of the S10 made this a super easy decision for me.  Sure, I_l miss a few things about iOS very few. But I_ LOVING this S10 right now!",69

3,"My favourite phone to date! But the camera..
  
",29.Mar.19,Yes,"First and foremost I love the screen, big beautiful and crisp. It makes consuming media such a pleasurable experience! The size of the phone is a bit big otherwise lol, but you can make it work using the one handed operations quite easily..Battery life is definitely another win, I get through a full day consistently with 50-40 percent left before I go to bed around 11,with moderate usage (YouTube and Netflix watching, social media etc.)So of course the camera. Toting 5 lenses you'd think it would be amazing, but it's a big let down, at least to me. The options are many but the image quality is subpar; don't know what's going on with the image processing, but my nexus 6p of 3 + years ago still takes much better pictures. They may seem good on the surface but as soon as u zoom in, even a little bit, on a picture you took, it looks bad.It mars an otherwise perfect phone.",6

2,"phone was okay, but the seals were cut already
  
",29.May.19,Yes,"the phone box's seals were cut and opened.  When the package arrrived, there is no protective material (paper or bubble packs) inside he shipping box.  The samsung phone  box was opened during the shipping.  All accessories and the actual phone were moving freely inside the shipping box.  I observed a few light scratch on the phone.  Very disappointed.",3

1,"this is not a United States product ONLY RATED ONE STAR SINCE NO STARS WAS NOT AN OPTION
  
",19.Jun.19,Yes,"This phone is made for use by United Arab Emirates and does not have all the current Samsung USA selections like wi-fi calling.  It is actually sold thru a 3rd party Seller, Technomaster which provides no stateside contact number, but rather only an e-mail  for any assistance.  Samsung USA indicated they would not support this product if there were any issues, nor would it be covered by the FCC. It says international, but no further info is provided.Penalties for not returning the phone within 15 days  and the restock fee are steep, especially when you are working with Amazon Customer Service, my AT&amp;T service provider, and Samsung Customer Service.I returned the phone to Technomaster in MA, but was charged a 20% of cost restocking fee.DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE.  THE COST IS APPEALING, BUT YOU WILL LOSE MONEY IN THE END, AND IT WILL NOT BE SUPPORTED BY SAMSUNG USA.",8
