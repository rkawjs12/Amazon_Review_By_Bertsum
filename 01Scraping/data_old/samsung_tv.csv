2,"Not User Friendly 'Smart'?
  
",4.Aug.18,No,"Bought this at 'B-Buy'. Kept it two days. Traded it for '5500 Series'. Talked to Samsung.. [Said] What you get? Is what you get!Pro: Was a BEAUTIFUL picture.. That was about all?!CONS: Wobbly feet. Tipping over forwards? Samsung insists you have an account, including Credit Card number! (For your own convenience) ""Smart TV"" UI, more like a giant 'Pop-Up' ad!? Full of sponsored links! Samsung admitted; CAN'T get rid of advertisements? (Built into the Firmware)More CONS: Speakers were small and 'tinny'. Lacked I/O ports.. (The '5500 Series' has three HDMI ports. Toslink out, and 'line level' PCM audio out. Better speakers. Dual USB ports. One for 'stick', and another for HDD. Better 'Blue Tooth', etc.)Don't understand WHY Samsung left out the 'Bells and Whistles' on this TV? Why Samsung insists on selling the consumer something that looks more like a 3rd rate Web Browser? Full of 'Adware'? (Already got enough commercials on TV?)Finally. Samsung insisted. This 'N5300 series' Smart TV? Actually has 2017 Firmware! Although it says (2018), [in parenthesis]? IF you're counting on Samsung to support 'upgrades' to this TV Software, the next 10-years? Good luck?Not for us.. Took the choice, and said NO! We're not putting up with it...",21
2,"Samsung used to make good tvs
  
",11.Aug.18,Yes,"If you want a sharp picture, this is not the set for you. I found the quality to be about what you would expect from an over-the-air broadcast station you bring in with an antenna on your roof. I couldn't stand to watch it. I sent it back and the seller gave me a full refund, which is the only good thing I can say about this tv.",6
5,"My Research Bore Out: FANtastic TV
  
",19.Nov.18,No,"32"" is perfect viewing in small room size. Picture quality &amp; sound: outstanding (disagree with reviews that are negative on sound &amp; say you need a separate soundbar). Feet/stand very secure, but note that you'll need a 'skinny'/thin flat screwdriver to attach (single handle where you can change bit sizes will likely be too thick to fit inside). For extra safety I plan to use Gorilla Duck tape to attach to table (but am waiting to first buy/receive a height adjustable up to 9"" swiveling base). Setup/connection very easy (back of tv clearly color coded to wires; on screen setup fast &amp; simple without needing mobile phone app). You will need to know your WIFI password to enter during setup. Best TV I've ever had! Family loves it. Seems silly to me that people buy lesser quality brands for very small $ savings over this TV (especially when a TV is a long term purchase). In my opinion Samsung is best TV (LG used to be a close second, but now a far second; cheaper Insignia TVs are a far third if you're really tight on every dollar). MSRP on this TV increased this year, but sale prices are actually lower than past years!Only small negative is the included remote control. It's not as ergonomic to hold/use as my Comcast remote (plus I'm used to the keys/location on it). Most remotes though (including Comcast) can be universally programmed to any TV, but you need to know your TV's remote code (took many links/time to find it). For this 2018 Samsung model, it's: 10702. Search up the instructions for entering the code on your remote (yours will be different from mine, &amp; please don't ask me to search for you).",3
5,"Fabulous on the second try - odor issue.
  
",7.Dec.18,No,"Most of our flat screen TVs  have been Samsungs - they have a superior picture quality. We needed a new 32""  to replace our aging 32 which is mounted in a custom built cabinet  - and they no longer make 36"" models here so another 32 inch was required. Our eleven year-old unit worked fine but the picture was slowly fading (as was  our aging eyesight). First of all, there are not a lot of choices out there in this size. I went to our local big box discounter and picked up the 32 inch 1080 Samsung smart TV - again, the Samsung  had the best picture on display.It was an easy install, light weight, and had an incredibly clear and bright picture. However, there was an electric smell emanating  from it.  Checking  reviews revealed one reference to this anomaly. We waited three weeks hoping it would dissipate  but it did not.Disappointed, I  returned it to the dealer and immediately bought a recommended Vizio 32 inch 1080. It was an easy  install but we found the picture clearer in some ways but a little muted  - despite all the adjustments you could do - basically it is good  feature filled tv but the picture not to our liking. That unit was returned the same day. Got all the money back.Given the limited market offerings  in 32 inch tvs we  decided to give the Samsung one more try hoping that our previous units was just a lemon. The original dealer had no more Samsungs.Went to another dealer showroom and once again that same 32 inch 1080 Samsung out-shined the competition. The salesmen said that it was their best 32 inch and he had not heard of the odor issue, and knew of no returns  for that model (he looked it up on their in-store system). They had a good return policy (30 days) plus a very affordable 2 year extension, and it had a holiday season mark down of 100$ less (a 33% discount) than I paid for my first one.  Well, again installed it and then waited for the oder, which was barely noticeable compared to the  first unit  and gone after a few days. So...our first unit was really defective.We love the tv.The moral is that anyone buying a tv should see it in person before  buying and make sure that the vendor (online or brick and mortar) has a no fee 100% cash back return policy for  at least one month in case you get a rare defective unit..Good fishing!",0
4,"Great picture but problematic sound, would stick with Dumb TV
  
",9.Dec.18,No,"The picture is great, even from the side. The interface is somewhat confusing and a lot to get used to. Based on my experience, I would not buy this more expensive smart TV (or probably any other), but would stick with an Amazon fire or Roku box instead. You are beholden to the TV manufacture's software that has been installed and whether the app you want to run has been written to support the software. As an example,  there is no Acorn app written for Samsung so I have to keep my Amazon fire box connected to this ""smart"" TV just to see the one streaming service. Amazon Fire/Roku has the best selection of apps.I knew audio would be a problem but I didn't think it would be much of a problem. I bought to TV thinking that I can't do anything to fix the picture, but I have options to get the audio working. First the sound is adequate for my small room. But there are times (movie dialog) when I could use a crisper sound for my old ears. I could not hook up my computer speakers because they have a headphone jack and the TV only has an optical digital output connection. I knew that before the purchase. So I bought a digital to analog converter. I got it to work after changing the settings: audio out changed from TV speakers to optical digital; audio type to PCM. It works but I didn't realize that you cannot control the volume of a digital audio device using the Samsung remote. Volume control is disabled. I don't know if this true for all TV companies but it seems like a ridiculous feature. So if I keep this setup, I will have to get up every time that I want to change the volume. I haven't done that for 20 years. My only option now is to get a sound bar or any other audio device that can be controlled with it's own separate remote control ... add another remote to the coffee table.There was an annoyance in trying to register the TV on the Samsung site. This has to be done if you want to connect to Smart Hub where you can download apps. Here again, Amazon/Roku has a simpler design. The serial number was not accepted on the registration page. After a 30 minute online chat with a Samsung tech, I was told it would have to resolve further up the support chain. I am still waiting.I have only had the TV for 4 days so I am sure I will add to my review as I find more things out.",0
3,"Decent Picture, HORRIBLE Sound
  
",29.Dec.18,No,"Note: Rating of 3/5 includes the built-in speakers, probably 4(maybe 4.5)/5 not accounting the speakers.Haven't had this television for too long, but I have been messing around with it the past few days. Here are my initial impressions(will edit an update if anything changes).Picture -When it comes to the picture, the picture is adequate. It's not so good out of the box(move those backlight/sharpness sliders down friends!). I used ""Movie"" mode. The colors are a bit off out of the box, but can be changed to be somewhat manageable. I saw an online review mentioning that ""warm2"" was the best color temperature for accuracy, however there must be some kind of quality control consistency with these panels, because warm2 looked really bad. Both warm and warm2 produced VERY orange shifted colors, making everything seem coated with carrot color(even black and white). For my television, ""Normal"" color temperature seemed closest to what I'd assume is more closer to accurate(slightly off-white whites). I left it on ""cool"" however, to make white - white, for better general viewing. The colors are a bit hyped out of the box, which you'll need to dial down a bit unless you want everyone to look sunburned.This television sort of struggles with the blacks, as expected for IPS, but it's on the worse end. A lot of things will seem a bit on the gray side instead of black. It's difficult to get good blacks without having to mess up the rest of the picture. Speaking of IPS, due to it having an IPS screen, the viewing angles are not bad. There is a slight shift in color/brightness to the sides, but most of the shift for me seems to be noticeable when viewing it from a higher angle.Sound -This is the real downfall for this TV, the sound. It sounds BAD. When I say bad, I mean just really bad. It's both muddied and shrieking at the same time. With the standard sound, male vocals pretty much always sound distorted/muddied and pushed back, while female vocals sound muddied,thin, and fairly upfront. The sound travels fairly far(which is a disadvantage for us, since it can disturb others in the house). The ""amplify"" sound setting makes it sound a little bit better, but it leaves it sounding very peaky, as when I heard it from another room, all I would hear is the ""ch ch ch"" sound from the treble when people were speaking.It's one of the worst sounding TV speakers we have in our home. Our older extremely thin smaller LG TV with smaller speakers sounds a lot better, and our similarly sized TCL TV from a few years ago also sounds a lot better. I'm pretty sure my extremely small(smaller than a small plastic cup) bluetooth speaker even sounds better than the TV. When I looked underneath, the speaker seemed like it was quite a decent size, so I'm a bit lost on how it can sound so bad. I very highly recommend you budget a soundbar into the price when purchasing this TV. It's just atrocious sounding. Some notes I wanted to mention is that this TV does not have a 3.5mm output, so you're limited to optical/HDMI, and this television has an equalizer for the built-in speaker(only works for the speaker) with 100 Hz, 200 Hz, 500 Hz, 1 KHz, 2 KHz, 5 KHz, and 10 KHz adjustment points. Lastly, it seems like the more ""muddy"" sound comes through the vents at the top of the unit. If you can isolate the sound coming from the vents from the bottom, it can sound slightly better(still horrible though).Features/control -It's not as simple to navigate as the TCL Roku TV we had purchased. The menu layout is a bit clunky. Setting options are also quite limited for the device apart from the settings you don't usually find on others(like the equalizer or the white balance settings). The IR sensor seems to be a bit finicky, as sometimes I press the remote and it doesn't respond, unless I'm holding it perfectly, but it also works at unusual angles as well so it's a bit strange.The TV can be a bit sluggish randomly, but it's generally adequate in terms of speed.When it comes to connectivity, this television has a basic Ethernet jack if needed. Its included wireless seems to be ok as well without any glaring performance issues in terms of the wireless.This television comes with a number of pre-installed apps. You can remove them from your ""Home"" page, however you cannot uninstall these pre-installed apps it appears.Design -No premium design with this set. Its design screams budget, unlike some other sets at this price point that try to add some minor 'premium' design features here and there. Speakers are downward facing on both sides. The TV stand legs does not lift the TV high enough to place other devices(like a DVD player or smaller cable box) underneath.Update Edit:I noticed that there seems to be no way to disable this television's Wi-Fi Direct functionality. There is also no option to automatically deny any Wi-Fi Direct requests. As it stands, Wi-Fi Direct is always on and you will receive a popup on your screen if any nearby device tries to connect. Based on the support articles, older Samsung televisions used to have the option to disable it it seems(or at least enable it if it was disabled).  I don't understand why Samsung feels like this should always be on. My Roku TV allows for both Wi-Fi Direct disabling(assuming you don't use the Wi-Fi Direct remote models) as well as the option to automatically deny any Wi-Fi Direct requests. I had it disabled temporarily by resetting the network settings, but it returned back once the TV was power cycled.Update Edit 2: It seems like HDR content has separate video settings. If you set video settings for SDR content, you're going to have to adjust the settings as well when you end up on HDR content.Update Edit3: We've now had this television for a few months. I have read other reviews concerning this television not turning on. We had not had that happen until today. Tried to turn it on(by remote/button) and the power light would change to indicate the difference, but nothing on the screen/no audio. Had to unplug/replug. Hopefully this does not continue to occur.",1
1,"Buyer Beware Samsung HDCP 1080P Major Conflicts!!!
  
",20.May.19,No,"Don't make the mistake I did buying a 1080P TV from Samsung that will never display 1080P...  The HDCP copy protection along w/ the firmware from Samsung does not work properly with Blu-Rays or other devices...  I didn't realize I was seeing in 1080i only when I got mine until I tried hooking up a Blu-Ray player... It wont even detect it in 1080P without a disc in it much less play anything legally bought in 1080P... I've seen many who had auto updates turn their TV into useless trash by creating a conflict... I had no idea what HDCP was or anything else, most of the TVs wont even update as they are supposed to... I tried updating my firmware using 3 different USB sticks, deleting every file on them... Doing everything possible... Making the bin file the only thing on the stick... Making its own directory then putting it in there... Putting the file in zipped/unzipped, nothing will even read it, I've been on-line since 300 baud modems... So if are old tech or new, trust me on this, just avoid anything Samsung.  Even the USB port has a copy protection on it forcing to register to supposedly be allowed to use it???  You can't even buy a TV, stick a USB in it to play things without them trying to make it difficult?  I'm basically only given the option to go in pirate sites or use pirated stuff if want to view it... Since the legally bought Blu-Rays or players refuse to allow me to watch what I own/paid for because of bogus HDCP?",0
