4,"Pretty much as expected. Positive experience so far.
  
",2.Jan.19,Yes,"This review is for the phone, but considering how it was bought from this Amazon seller.I was a bit weary to buy, given the varying reviews. It arrived in a white, unmarked box as expected as a renewed/refurbished product. Came with an offbrand charger, but no headphones.The description said, by definition, it would have minimal to no scratches. There is one 3/8 to 1/2 scratch near the front camera on the screen that goes into the functional screen area. It_ not terrible, but I would consider it a little more severe than minimal.Battery health was said to be about 80% if I remember correctly. Battery health as received was 96%, which I was happy about.Everything else, a few days in, seem to be on par with a new phone. I will update this review with any shortfalls or unanticipted failures going forward.",329
5,"Beautiful phone
  
",4.Jan.19,Yes,The phone arrived three day early. This phone is beautiful and flawless. Battery life is more than I expected. Phone works perfectly. I had to contact customer service through email and they responded to my questions immediately.,4
1,"Don't buy from this seller.
  
",8.Jan.19,Yes,"This product is falsely labeled as unlocked, it's been 4 weeks since I informed that the phone was still locked and all I get are excuses.Plus, the phone came in a really bad condition, so many scratches you can see them very clearly.",102
1,"Not refurbished!
  
",9.Jan.19,Yes,"Super disappointed when I got this phone. I rarely leave reviews but when I opened this phone I was aggravated. Screen has scratches and the outside edges of the phone are dirty. This is clearly not a refurbished phone, so it should not be advertised as such. Now I have to wait for another one which is even more aggravating!",241
4,"Overall phone review
  
",10.Jan.19,Yes,"This is a refurbished iPhone X. The box is from Verizon company that comes with only the charger and the phone. Doesn_ have a pin to eject the SIM card nor earphones. The screen is a bit scratched but that_ to be expected since it_ refurbished. The box also said that it_ a pre owned. So the assumption is that someone turned in the phone for an upgrade. The battery health is at 99%. Today is the first day I_ using it so don_ really know how long the battery will last me. I ordered a screen protector so maybe that_l blocker the scratch a bit. We shall see. Overall, it_ a cheap iPhone X with 256 GB. I have T-Mobile and the SIM card works. Not a bad deal at all.",73
5,"Best Value!
  
",18.Jan.19,Yes,"The best decision I_e made buying a phone. Phone is in PERFECT condition. Battery condition is at 98%! Best value for the price, much cheaper than buying a new phone directly from Verizon brand new. Will absolutely buy me next phone from Verizon Pre-Owned.",0

5,"Very satisfied!
  
",5.Feb.19,Yes,"My iPhone X was delivered in what I believe to be near perfect condition. Very light scratch on the face of the screen, however it disappeared after installing a tempered glass screen protector. Powered on just fine and is fully compatible with my at&amp;t SIM card. The iPhone came with 89% of it_ original factory battery health which is more than advertised for this refurbished product (battery health can be found in settings). With the iPhone X I also received both an apple brand power cable and wall adapter (I got lucky). My apple AirPods and apple watch (both sold separately) paired to this devise without any issues.Overall: I received my product exactly as advertised which makes me very satisfied. Other reviewers complain about things outside of the sellers control such as the lack of a headphone jack and the new gesture controls used in place of the retired _ome button. The learning curve felt easy and natural. Potential buyers should look into the features of the phone before buying this product new OR refurbished. 5/5 stars highly recommended.",90

5,"So your_e not sure? Be sure. Here_ why.
  
",14.Feb.19,Yes,"This IPhone X has been phenomenal. The speed at which it operates is Incredible. If you are questioning this buy, don_. It_ a wonderful deal. I_e not had one issue thus far, and will most certainly update this review if I have one within the warranty period. I recommend getting a tempered glass screen and a good case_his phone is glass front and back.",107

3,"Renewed with aftermarket parts. I believe so
  
",17.Apr.19,Yes,"Package came with it some random box. Do note this is not from apple.For my unit, I believe the previous owner dropped it and broke the screen. I have reasons to believe my screen is not authentic. It_ easily scratch.I notice small dent marks on the bottom &amp; at the back of the phone.Battery health is 88% for mine which is sort of disappointing.Take note:-Phone is definitely used-Battery health is not within 90%-small dents-easily scratch on screen-it_ probably not water resistant anymore, if they actually replaced the screen.-no original cable or adapterOverall, it works fine. But I just want to put this out there so some of you will consider it before purchasing it. For the price is honestly ok.",1
1,"Possibility to change the phone?

5,"came in perfect like new condition
  
",23.Apr.19,Yes,Phone has looked and acted like NEW since day one. Was definitely a risk buying something so expensive refurbished but it absolutely worked out this time. If all the refurbished phones come like this I HIGHLY recommend taking advantage of the $400 difference from a new Iphone X 265GB.,1
1,"I requested a silver one for my wife and received a gray.
  
",14.May.19,Yes,I requested a silver one and got a gray one. Extremely disappointed as nobody reviewed the product and compared it with my original order,2
2,"Disappointed
  
",16.May.19,Yes,"Comes with very visible scratches at the front and the sides. As much as I hate to write a negative review, but I had no choice. Had ordered this for my brother on his birthday expecting it to at least have some minor scratches, but got to see it is full of scratches on the front and sides, I've bought renewed phones before but never faced a situation like this. Very dissatisfied.",148

",1.Jun.19,Yes,Would be 5 stars if they didn_ only give me a charger with an iPhone X!! No headphones equipped to work on this phone or an adapter to use!!!! Very frustrating!! Also came in a generic box!!,0
5,"And for the money ...I am totally happy with this iPhone X
  
",2.Jun.19,Yes,"The IPhone X 256 I received works perfectly. 90% battery health.  Looks brand new, no scratches or wear of used that I could see. Came with a screen protector. And for the money ...I am totally happy with this iPhone X.I was under the impression that fully unlocked meant that it could be used with any carriers (Tmobile,att&amp;t GSM carriers and  Verizon, Sprint CDMA carriers. But my IPhone X that I received according to the model number only works with GSM carriers. So if your looking for a fully unlocked iPhone for all Carriers I would recommend contacting the seller to make sure you are receiving the fully unlocked iPhone X.",2
5,"Works with Verizon
  
",4.Jun.19,Yes,After spending time reading the reviews I wasn_ sure if it would work with Verizon. When I received the phone I popped in my sim and worked perfectly. The phone had minor blemishes... nothing to be concerned with... what you would expect with a refurbished phone. I_e had the phone for almost a month and everything is working great! Overall I would recommend.,0
1,"Great phone that stopped working!
  
",10.Jun.19,Yes,"I recently decided to upgrade from the iPhone 7 to the iPhone X.I was unimpressed with any enhanced features, and namely the new face recognition to unlock the device. After the first two days of owning the new iPhone, I was over it. Gone was the ease of simply using a finger print to unlock the phone. This became annoying since I have to have a passcode on the phone and many apps I use day to day require either a pin or passcode which would generally use the finger id. Yes, the face recognition would unlock the device, but I had to literally pickup the phone every time I wanted to access email, text messages, or review information in an app. Previously, my phone could rest on my desk, I simply use my finger id to unlock and easily access whatever. Now, I have to pick up the phone or make it obvious I am accessing something on my phone.Aside from the new facial recognition, there is nothing really feature enhanced from the iPhone 7. Sure, you can argue, better camera etc, but that is minimal and not worth the money or upgrade with something already awesome. The downside was i didn't even own the phone for 3 weeks and the screen stopped working, the phone wouldn't power on... very disappointing.",0
1,"DISAPPOINTED!
  
",11.Jun.19,Yes,Really was excited for this purchase....phone had few scratches but in overall great shape. Sad to say I only had the phone for a few days and now the screen is unresponsive to touch. Tried all resets still dont work so im guessing its hardware. Very dissapointing. I am now trying to return to get a refund.,1

1,"Do not buy second hand phones .
  
",10.Jul.19,Yes,"Before purchasing the phone as a upgrade from my I phone 7 ,  I read all the reviews, then I made  one of the the the biggest mistake of my life the phone is a total waste of time , everything is bad about the I phone x , considering it cost me so much money,  I believe Amazon  should monitor carefully the sale of used phone it's is obvious no one cares.  I am certain  the previous owner had problems and I brought it  on myself,  I am so dissatisfied.",2
5,"Absolute Steal
  
",13.Jul.19,Yes,"The phone works perfectly fine, and honestly ended up exceeding expectations. Looking for a refurbished/renewed phone most times mean that you will have a kink or defect in the phone somewhere but not this one. The phone works great and honestly cant tell what_ supposed to be wrong with the phone. Had for 2 weeks and not a single problem. Would highly recommend buyerspray when ordering yours",1

5,"Came looking like new and no issues so far!
  
",19.Jul.19,Yes,"iPhone X came with 94% battery life. It looks almost new. One or 2 tiny scratches and no other issues so far. The phone powered on immediately and was fully charged. Even though the phone was described as GSM unlocked only and not suited for Verizon my Verizon sim worked. It_ model number A1865 which I found on the web as the fully unlocked model. So, you may want to look for that when ordering. I now have a MintMobile sim in the phone and it works on T-Mobile towers. I_e had no issues so far and was happy for the price I paid $584. You should watch the price because it fluctuates. I will update if anything changes with the phone_ functionality.",2
5,"Incredible value
  
",20.Jul.19,Yes,"I was a bit nervous buying such a pricey phone refurbished, but I was very impressed. Battery came at 95% health, the device came with a screen protector and generic accessories (which were actually better than what normally is included), and the only imperfection was a small scratch that I hope is in the screen protector but is hardly noticeable. For half the price of the new phone, this was incredible quality",0

",30.Jul.19,Yes,As soon as I took it out of the box it wouldn't turn on. It didn't have any scratches or anything but it simply wouldn't charge and therefore couldn't use it. I was very dissapointed because it had such great reviews and I waited so long to receive it.,1
