1,"Microphone Didn't Work on Brand New Phone
  
",5.Jun.19,No,"I own 3 Google Mini's, a Google Home, and a Chrome-cast, and had just signed up for Google-Fi, so I figured it was time to have a Google phone.It arrived 6/3 and the microphone stopped working 6/4 and am having it refunded on 6/5.I got called from a potential employer twice and they couldn't hear me. They wasted 7 hours of my time.Purchased from the Google store.I had 6 interactions where Google couldn't identify the problem before saying it'd take 2-7 days to ship a replacement.I asked if they could simply overnight it, or give me a two year warranty, or literally anything since they are selling faulty phones. Long story short, it's their 3rd generation of phones and they still can't get it right, and they don't even want to try. I've been Google loyal for 7 years and after they delivered a faulty phone and didn't want to make it right, I'm switching to Apple.",16
5,"Very nice phone, but needs a better pricing plan
  
",6.Jun.19,No,"This is a very nice phone with lots of features.  Most notable is the quality camera that is used and the flat screen rather than the curved screen on Samsung phones.  Also notable is that you are getting pure android and not someone's proprietary apps and bloat.  One negative is that it is not the latest greatest processor but rather a upper middle of the road one.  The other negatives is the high price to get it unlocked if not activating with a carrier.  Why should it cost a hundred dollars more without activation, especially when several places were offering pre-sale gift cards worth 100 dollars.  I put the item in my cart which included a 100 Amazon gift card, but when I went to purchase it indicated that the gift-card offer was no longer available.  If they sold this for $379 it would be well worth the money but no way is it a $479 (almost 500 phone).",6

5,"best phone I ever owned
  
",13.Jun.19,No,"I always bought phones in the 200-300 range and of course it showed, there is usually a lack of quality, the camera is mediocre and some of the cool functions are not included. I'm glad I found the Pixel 3a, this is the best phone in the mid-range price out there. I know it is slightly more than my past range, but I finally wanted a phone that does more, but doesn't cost an arm and a leg. I read tons of reviews and watched several videos to make sure I'm not wasting my money (it's still a huge junk of change for me). I can say with delight, this phone is amazing.Pros:- The camera is wonderful, it makes great pictures in low light, at night and has so many filters and options... I can't say enough how awesome the camera is.- The battery life is amazing, my phone only lasted through the day if I didn't do anything. This phone lasts all day even with some gaming (1-2h).- Basic Android with minimal bloatware- I was able to transfer almost all my data with no issues or hick-ups- There is a headphone jack - wahooo (I guess I'm old school,  but I like it)- I love the fast charging option, never had it before and it is great getting 70% in 20min- Super light and compact, I do appreciate the size and that this phone is smaller than my oldCons:- no wireless chargingI can't say much about material, the material seems to be the same as all my old phones. My friend with an Iphone of course pointed out that it looks cheap, but really.... I don't know anything else, so I don't care. I would totally buy it again and my husband is looking forward to getting one too. Thumbs up!",3
5,"No need to spend a $1000 bucks. This is a game changer.
  
",15.Jun.19,Yes,"Careful when buying these, mine was not Verizon compatible and had to return it even though the seller said it was. ""Completely unlocked"" does not mean it will work on US carriers. As far as the phone goes it's hands down the best $400 phone  on the market in 2019. The camera is amazing, battery life great and form factor perfect. As long as you get it here or from the manufacturer and not your carrier it comes with guaranteed three years of support. It's also easy to work on if it breaks.",4
5,"Best phone for the $, period!
  
",18.Jun.19,No,"The screen, camera, and battery life alone make this phone a solid value for it's price. That doesn't even get a list of this device's pros started. It's built and maintained by Google with guaranteed updates for three-years. There is hardly a noticeable difference between I and it's pricier sibling and if you have the Google branded case applied, anyone on the street would be hard-pressed to tell the two apart based on aesthetics alone. Once you pick it up, there still is not a notable difference in day to day use, or speed doing all the phone things that phones do. This device might be a hair slower to process certain tasks, but not enough to discount it's nearly halved price tag.Before this phone I used the Moto G7, and while a great feeling phone, I chose to keep the pixel 3a as my daily driver and have the G7 to a family member who now also has one of the top budget phones. The G7 just doesn't have that Pixel wow, that kept me picking it up over the latter.Hopefully Google will continue this trend with a Pixel 4a, if I can keep from picking up the Pixel 4 after rejoining the Pixel family after the Nexus program began to flop miserably. This 3a though, is reminiscent of the Nexus glory days of the Nexus 4 and 5x.",3
5,"More for your money
  
",19.Jun.19,Yes,"This phone is great, no complaints. The camera is unbelievable and the night vision pictures are really nice. Runs pure android as you would expect from a Google branded phone. There are plenty of reviews on this phone on the internet, so I won't get into super detail, but you can't go wrong with this phone.",5
5,"Good mid-range Phone
  
",20.Jun.19,Yes,"Good mid-range phone with advanced camera algorithms from Google that produce beautiful pictures. Battery life is ok for being 3,000 mAh.",2
5,"Has headphone jack.
  
",22.Jun.19,Yes,It a hell of a bang for your buck.,2
5,"Surprised It's Worth 4 Times The Prie
  
",23.Jun.19,No,"OK, I got it for $200 on a T Mobile special price but it's worth 4 times the price. I migrated from a Samsung S7 Edge and am happy with the results. It is not as much of a step up in quality ""feel"" or display but it does have a better camera and battery life. I have nothing against my Samsung Edge and have kept it as a backup phone. The price was due to my trade in of a Samsung S6 phone.Dislikes, muting phone ring with power/volume button is hard to reverse and need to learn new menus.I like the camera of course but also the little things like the fingerprint reader on the back and Android Pay vs Samsung Pay. Just place your index finger on the back and your ready to pay! The little things and the price are big for me.",3
4,"Good pictures.
  
",29.Jun.19,Yes,"The best thing about this phone is its picture. Seems like the engineers have put a lot of effort into designing its camera-related features. Best value for the price paid.

5,"Amazing camera. Good enough phone.
  
",9.Jul.19,Yes,"Have been using this phone for a little over 3 weeks now and so far have not found it lacking. I deliberately left behind my camera (a Panasonic ZS-100) on my recent trip to Japan to see if it could take the place of a regular camera, and it did not disappoint. Night sight was especially a revelation-- I had results that rivaled a DSLR or mirrorless camera with a 1.8 prime lens wide open. Plus Google Maps and Translate were a godsend in navigating the subway system. I never felt lost as long as I had my Pixel. Battery life was decent, going as low as 25% after a full day using the camera and navigation apps. Always carried a powerbank just in case.",5

5,"Way cooler than iPhone
  
",12.Jul.19,Yes,I have the 3a xl for over a month now and I cannot stop raving about the camera. The phone is very intuitive. Few of my friends switched from their iPhone to pixel.,3
3,"Good deal for Android fans
  
",14.Jul.19,No,"I really wanted to like the Pixel 3a - it's camera is amazing and truly unique at this price point, but you already knew that. Every reviewer is raving about it, battery life is adequate, screen is amazing and overall experience is quite pleasant. To me, coming from an iPhone 7, it's not much of an upgrade - I can get by with an older camera and LCD display, battery life is on par or better with standby. If you are asking yourself if you want/need this phone then that's the real question. Battery life is decent for Android, which isn't saying much and isn't really a selling point as others have mentioned - this is the phone the Pixel 3 should have been, but with better build quality. And if we're being honest, build quality does factor in, there is nothing sexy about this phone and isn't even understated enough to be charming, it's just bland. I'm not a power user, and will admit I much prefer IOS in favor of stable apps, great standby battery life/optimization, Siri belonging on the short bus, and GASP - iMessage. I applaud Google for such a great effort to bring back the cheap smart phone, I just wish it either tried harder to beat Apple or go their own way, but like most things Google, the end product is merely half baked.",9
5,"Great phone at reasonable price
  
",16.Jul.19,No,"The unlocked Pixel 3a is a great mid-range phone!  Just understand this is a mid-range phone and hence why the price is around $400, instead of $800-1,000+.  I originally bought the Moto G7 but wasn't thrilled with it due to sub-par battery life and no wifi-calling, so decided to return and spend an extra $100 for the Pixel 3a.  So far I'm totally thrilled with my 3a.  I like the smaller size, love that it has wifi-calling on Verizon and the battery gives me close to a full day with normal use.  The 3a also has much tighter reception (mobile and wifi), speeds are faster. Also the 3a has NFC which is a nice bonus.  Since I don't take many pictures I can't comment here but I understand the 3a has a great camera, if not the best, for those that care.  I wish it had better water protection but overall I easily rate it a 5 for the price.  The G7 was nice, but get the 3a if you can spare the extra $100.",2
5,"Pefect size phone, very good camera
  
",18.Jul.19,No,"I wish that Google had simply pumped up the specs for the 2013 Nexus 5 phone. It was perfect in so many ways, but notably, size. It fit in any pocket and was a great PHONE. The camera wasn't very good, but that was its one weak point.  I really miss that device. I moved to a Nexus 6 (Way too big) and then a Pixel XL in 2016. Great phone and also big, but lightning fast - even today. My daily driver is now a OnePlus 6T and it is also big. It has a nice bezel-less screen and loads app faster than I can call them up. But, after eight months of use, the battery no longer lasts all day like it did when new.All that is prelude to getting this new Google Pixel 3a - essentially the same phone as the Pixel 3, but in a more plasticy case and without the graphics processor to speed things up for the camera. Experts are proclaiming this phone to have a truely outstanding camera - state-of-the-art, no less. And it is good. But more about the shooter in a minute or two.The Pixel 3a - straight out of the box, is impressive. It is a smaller phone than many flagships out there, but I really like a phone that doesn't make me splay my fingers out when trying to do something one-handed with my phone. The display is very pleasant and the current version of the Android operating system is great. (My wife has an iPhone and occasionally asks for my help. I can't do half the stuff with IOS that I can do with Android, but I'm a bit biased.)The setup instructions are do-it-in-your-sleep simple, so if you hesitate upgrading because you've got a lot of stuff on your old phone, don't. The only hiccup I found was that one app on my eight month old OnePlus didn't transfer - it turns out that the app in question has been removed from the Google Play Store, so it wouldn't be moved to my new phone. What is curious to me is that most apps that get transferred to the new phone, using Google's transfer process, require you to log in with your username and password the first time you use them. OK, I get it. But, when I open up my saved wifi networks - some I haven't used in years - they're there and require no credentials. Not sure of the logic in this.The 64gb of internal storage is plenty for my needs - I generally don't store large video files on my phone nor have hundreds of apps. And, like the OnePlus, the phone is fast - apps load quickly.  The 3a battery lasts all day for me, but it's brand new. Check back with me in a year.The phone comes with an earphone jack, so I can use my old wired headsets again. The battery charges very quickly, too. I can run the phone down to under 20%, plug it in for 15-20 minutes and get the battery back up to 45-50% - enough to last the rest of my day.So, about that camera. Is it all that it is cracked up to be? Is it amazing?  Well, it is very good, but it surprised me that it isn't better than the camera on my OnePlus 6T. Now, to be honest, I did not use the night lighting feature. I'm sure it is nice, but I rarely, if ever, want to photograph things at night. If you do, then you might just adore the Pixel 3 camera. But to test out my observations, I took photos of a running fountain in my backyard on my original Pixel XL, my OnePlus 6T and the Pixel 3a. I looked at the resulting photos side-by-side on two identical monitors and judged them for color balance, hues and fine detail. In order of preference, the OnePlus came out first, then tne 3a, then the Pixel XL. The two pixel cameras had trouble with capturing the color of leaves and bark in the shaded portions of the photos. The OnePlus was more true to the colors in the actual scene and displaed more warmth. Details were slightly better on the two Pixel cameras, but not significantly better. Water droplets coming off the top tier of the fountain looked a bit more defined than on the OnePlus. This surprised me - Maybe I read too many critical reviews, but I thought that the OnePlus camera was one of its weaknesses - it isn't at all.In summary, the Pixel 3a is a fabulous phone. It comes in a convenient size and is backed up by two years of updates. The camera is very good and will reward you with very accurate photos. The software is quick like a bunny and transferring your old phone's applications to this one will be simple. You will like this phone a lot - and for about $400, it is a steal.",13

",24.Jul.19,No,"The Google Pixel 3a is not what I was expecting but in the very best way! I have used iPhones for a number of years. However when I recently wanted to upgrade my phone the iPhones on the market we're way out of my price range and I honestly didn't want to sign up for a plan having a monthly payment. I looked into many phones and decided on the Google Pixel 3a. I was surprised how it came with a transfer cable so I didn't loose any of my pictures or music from my old phone. How majority of the apps I had were added as well and all I had to do was sign in again. The camera works amazingly and I no longer have to worry about running out of room for my memories. While the layout and some of the applications are a bit different, I am now a converted Google Fan !

",31.Jul.19,Yes,"I was excited to get this phone, especially for the photo quality. In that area I am impressed, but as a phone it is a dog. Whenever I talk to someone they can't hear me. My voice is garbled or it disappears all together. I have blown out the speakers, rebooted, pulled SIM card, etc, etc, etc. Nothing works. Although the rest of the Galaxy 3a is great, without a good phone the rest doesn't matter. I will probably sacrifice my photo quality for a better phone and go back to Samsung. Too bad Google.",4
3,"Not great
  
",31.Jul.19,Yes,"Texting on this phone is horrific. The screen is to sensitive and your hand bumps the microphone symbol which interrupts your text or it hits the ""p"" button adding a p to whatever you're trying to type. It's honestly extremely frustrating. I wouldn't buy this phone again.",5

",1.Aug.19,Yes,"Before I bought this pixel 3a I was an advid iPhone user. My last iPhone I had was the 6s. I have been using this phone now for about 2 months and I am really enjoying it. The camera is my favorite feature and the battery usually lasts over 8 hours for me with a fullcharge. I can honestly say that I am enjoying this phone. I do miss ios features like iMessage and FaceTime, but not worth the switch back for me.

I've posted a picture of the Pixel 3A next to my Moto X4 that I carried around for 2 years (I have ten years of various other phones with pristine screens as well).  Apparently this phone uses ""Dragontail glass"" instead of the Corning Gorilla glass that comes on most phones.Google's support is awful.  Over chat their representative said it was a defect and that they would replace the phone.

",9.Aug.19,No,I'm pretty disappointed in this phone. I had to replace my Moto from a couple of years ago since we all know that smart phones generally have about a two year life before they start going bad on us. Battery life is my number 2 priority when shopping for a phone. This battery sucks. I'm so beyond disappointed. The store I purchased this from has a $50 restock fee and I've already paid hundreds of dollars. Overnight while having no background programs open it went from 100% to 97%. This morning while listening to YouTube for 30 minutes it went from 97% to 86%. As a professional photographer I couldn't care less about the camera. I don't appreciate the forced Google bar and the forced clock/weather whatever they call it. It's right on the home page where I would prefer to put apps I like better. The whole reason I don't use iPhone is because of forced app placement. I don't like the swipe up action that I have to do to go back to previous pages or to clear out background apps. As I feel stuck with this phone it's going to be a long two years.,2

For privacy I would rate this a zero, there is no privacy with a Google pixel. If you are an iPhone user I highly advise that you stick with your iPhone, it is a lot more secure and both front and rear cameras are the same quality. The Google pixel phone is not worth it.",1

When we arrived in France we got a SIM card with all the phone service and data we needed for a two week trip. It worked without a hiccup. Our pictures were amazing. We had fun messing around with the new camera features, great for a trip like that. Arriving in the US we got our permanent numbers, and we have used them for all of our internet connectivity and phone and texting since. Never once have the phones died, great battery life.

5,"Smartest smartphone I have used
  
",31.Aug.19,Yes,"I have been using the pixel 3a for almost a month now. It's been a positive experience, swapping iPhone to join the pixel wave. The highlight of the phone is the photos it can take and the overall user experience. This has to be the smartest smartphone I have used.It does everything so well and just blends in the background of your life. Squeeze for assistant, night sight, intelligent ram allocation, fingerprint scroll, now playing etc. make this phone appear smarter than most smartphones from even the top tier.I also like the fact that phone is so light in your hands and you can access the complete screen space using one finger.But, I do feel the phone is slightly less durable. The dragon trail glass used instead of gorilla looks and feel similar but seems a bit weaker. I dropped the phone on some sand and the glass on the right corner of the chin cracked. Usually, gorilla glass would deal with that kind of a fall without a crack.The battery life is great, recharges rapidly and lasts for a day's use - easy. The phone is not the fastest, but fast enough for almost everything you throw at it.In a nutshell, I think this is the best value your $399 can get in the smartphone universe.",0

This is half the price or a third of an iPhone with a better camera and the same features.You can also use Google messenger through wifi",3
5,"Excellent product of Google
  
",23.Sep.19,Yes,"I love my Pixel 3a, I chose it because of the great quality camera and its looking. Battery last all day and the also the 18W charging is really fast.

",27.Sep.19,Yes,"5th day:  why is the phone so hot? After 15 minutes, phone blanks out, will not turn on, will not charge.  I'll never know how good the photos of the Golden Gate Bridge/San Francisco turned out...I am glad it failed quickly so that I can return it for refund.  Sad.  Moving on...",2
5,"Best phone I ever had
  
",29.Sep.19,Yes,"Honestly I was skeptical buying this phone considering the internal specs but after using it I'm completely blown away, battery life is excellent, performance is great and camera is as amazing as everyone says it is.",0
1,"Dangerous failures.
  
",6.Oct.19,Yes,"Does not work.  Intermittent so chaulked it up to other causes.  Growing worse.  It's the phone.  If you live alone, it's dangerous.  Google should be ashamed.",3
5,"Amazing Phone all around. Easy switch from iPhone.
  
",8.Oct.19,Yes,Best phone ever.I came from an iPhone. Google has made the transition so seamless with an included adapter to physically transfer everything from iPhone to Android. Killer user interface. Great battery life. Amazing camera. I'm a full convert and couldn't be happier.Team Pixel.,1
5,"I love this phone
  
",11.Oct.19,Yes,"I've been putting up with some fairly mid-quality phones for a while so coming into this phone was like fresh air after a week in a locker room. Battery life is fantastic; I still put it on to charge overnight but once I was away from home without a charger and I still had a charge in the morning. The camera is amazing. I take so many pictures of my dogs.  I like being able to use motion capture on the pic, exporting them as a GIF and uploading them to twitter. Night Sight is a game-changer for nights out and dim settings.  Unlocking my phone with my fingerprint is fast and fantastic.  I'm more than happy with this purchase.",3
5,"Great phone
  
",12.Oct.19,Yes,"The best phone I've ever used! Battery life is good, not the best. I usually get a full 12-18 hrs out if the battery depending on the usage. I've never had to charge it before my work day was over. 9/10 I only charge it before bed. The camera is great! I don't usually take pictures but this camera inspired me to lol. Getting this phone has motivated me to get the entire Google eco system it's so user friendly.",1
5,"Great phone
  
",19.Oct.19,Yes,"Bought this to replace my Pixel 1 which had become increasingly flakey after the Android 10 upgrade.  Was surprisingly easy to move all my stuff over, since all of it was backed up to the cloud...  So far quite happy with the 3A, half the price I paid for my Pixel 1 when it was new.",0
5,"Easy to use...Amazing Value.
  
",26.Oct.19,Yes,"Great phone.Bought this for an older person. She needed something simple.  This has the simplest interface.  She can use it well without a lot of recurrent training.For the price it is a great phone. Screen is big and beautiful. Not the best but still beautiful.I would consider this for my daily driver. It is all around good. Not great, but for the price....value is amazing.",0

3,"Had to return it
  
",12.Nov.19,Yes,"I'm sure at this point you all read about how good the Pixel 3a is. I can attest to that. I bought mine from Amazon warehouse in ""used very good"" condition. Unfortunately i had to return it because the speakers were distorting when playing music. I hope it was a defective unit as i intend on picking up another one during the black friday sale",1
4,"Good Phone
  
",15.Nov.19,Yes,"Bought for my wife, she likes it, all is good.",0
5,"Got what I need for about 60% of the cost of a Pixel 3
  
",15.Nov.19,Yes,I bought the Pixel 1 and the battery went south after I play games on it incessantly.  This is a great replacement for a fraction of the cost and I am more careful with my screen time and not charging it past 80%.,0
5,"Best bang for your buck!!
  
",15.Nov.19,Yes,"This phone is absolutely amazing! It is by far the best phone for the money! I do not like to spend a lot of money on phones and comparatively this phone has all the features of a flagship phone and only half the price. I love that it's light weight and the case I bought for the phone made it absolutely perfect! I don't care for cameras and screens, Although I am told that the cameras on this phone are top notch. I'm more of an audiophile, the little stereo speakers sound awesome, the audio booster is great! I love the fact that it has so many factory installed ringtones and wallpapers which are great to look at and hear. I love video games so the retro game tones are right up my alley! It works perfectly with Android auto, other phones have been very glitchy or don't respond to voice as well as this phone! Overall this phone knocks it out of the park! Best bang for your buck!",0
1,"Unlocked phones doesn't work with every network...
  
",16.Nov.19,Yes,"I spent $400 on an unlocked phone expecting to be able to use it with my carrier, I mean it is unlocked for a reason right? Nope! Apparently the phone is ""programmed"" for my carrier so I just wasted all of that money on a paperweight. If you're going to sell a phone that's unlocked, at least say what networks it will work for...",2
3,"Great value if a flagship is too pricey
  
",22.Nov.19,Yes,"First and foremost, this is a wonderful phone for the price.  The reason I won't give it a higher rating is because the first phone I received was shipped with a jammed SIM card tray.  It seems others have had this issue as well.  Otherwise, if you need a new phone and can't afford a flagship phone, this is about as good as the middle of the road gets.",0
5,"Great purchase
  
",22.Nov.19,Yes,"I made a great purchase. THis phone is fast, the battery lasts more than 12 hours and the screen is great to look at. I also love how it connects to all my google services.",1
5,"Better than expected
  
",27.Nov.19,Yes,"Let me start by saying that I've never used an iPhone. I have had a couple of the Galaxy S series phones but that was several years back (3&amp;4). I have been buying unlocked phones online for the last few purchases.I really like the Motorola/Lenovo line of unlocked mid-level hardware phones. The phones work well but the hardware was uninspiring.My last three unlocked phones were an Essential PH-1, Honor 7+ and a OnePlus 6T. Of those 3 it's hard to beat the 6T.  Hardware is premium and the phone works well. The Essential phone felt great but the camera was average. I dropped the phone a few times and although the screen never cracked (it was in a case) the digitizer stopped responding. So, this was my replacement option.I really like this phone. The camera is pretty amazing for a 300 dollar phone. I challenge anyone to show me a phone at this price point with a better camera experience. I will say that I've noticed a 'processing' message in the bottom left corner of the camera interface when taking pictures under less than ideal conditions. I can only assume that is the software processing the images through whatever algorithm the Google engineers have come up with to create such strong results from a single camera. I assume that the top line Pixel phones with their higher end processors will be a little quicker in performing this function. I haven't found it to be an issue though.Although this is the cheaper of the pixel line of phones, it actually feels pretty solid. I'll try to update the review with a couple of non personal photos soon.I find the battery life to be adequate. It's not the best but I feel like it's good enough.If you want a phone with a pure Android experience, solid financial value and an amazing camera experience, you would be hard pressed to find a better deal than the Pixel 3A.",3
5,"Fenomenal
  
",28.Nov.19,Yes,"Extremadamente fluido. si no est√°s buscando dispositivo que no est√© en el top de los m√°s est√©ticos (por los marcos los cuales no son gran cosa) y que tenga buena autonom√≠a, super c√°mara y con la mejor experiencia Android, este es el m√°s adecuado en su rango de precio!",2
2,"WILL CLOSE MY AMAZON ACCOUNT
  
",1.Dec.19,Yes,"I purchased this phone from Amazon and it began freezing 5 weeks after purchase. I have rebooted numerous times, did a factory reset and still nothing. Amazon wants to charge me $80 for restocking! Ridiculous! i don't want a refund. Just a replacement and that should cost me $80? Well, my amazon addiction was just fixed. No more amazon shopping for me.",4
5,"Great phone!
  
",2.Dec.19,Yes,Love my new Google pixel 3a XL.  I previously had an iPhone 6 and didn't want to pay $$$$ to upgrade!  I especially love the camera!  Great picture quality and videos!  It was an easy transition from the iPhone for much less $.  Well worth the switch! I bought an unlocked phone and AT&amp;T is my carrier. I have had it for 2 months so far with no issues.  Don't hesitate to get a Google Pixel 3a XL. Love the bigger screen!,0
1,"Complete and total lack of support from Google.  Run like the wind to Apple.
  
",3.Dec.19,Yes,"I couldn't get the Google Assistant to work so I contacted google.  Their tech asked ""Where did you buy the phone?"". To which I responded, ""Amazon"".  To which she responded, ""then you should probably contact them"".  It will be interesting to see what Googles response is after I post the photographed exchange to Facebook.  I'm floored and not really sure who to be mad at...?!?!  The company that sold the unworking technology or the manufacturer that refused to support their own ""Google Assistant"" namesake.  Shame!",1
5,"Upgrading from OG Pixel
  
",3.Dec.19,Yes,"Just got mine today from Amazon.  Upgraded from my original Pixel, because the battery was not lasting long and needed multiple charges a day/ was running out of room. Was very easy to transfer all my contacts and apps, took maybe a total of 15 minutes. What I did find strange is that the tape from the Pixel 3a box itself was open. There was also no screen protector that you peel off when a phone is new... So this leads me to believe that it was a returned phone, which is a little concerning/ sketchy. However, everything is working great so, knock on wood that battery and everything holds up. I will update if anything bad happens. For now it is a very great deal ($300 on sale) and thus shall get a five star rating.",0
1,"Bought this in June - No longer charges
  
",7.Dec.19,Yes,"The charging port somehow doesn't work anymore. I've had it for 6 months lol. Took great care of it, original charger, no damaged wires or anything.",0
5,"Just an all around good phone for the price
  
",8.Dec.19,Yes,I like it. It works great for I use it for. I like the fact it has a headphone jack and a finger print scanner. Also it will get 3 years of Android updates and it's the right size to hold and very light weight.,0
5,"Very Happy
  
",10.Dec.19,Yes,I've had this phone for a few months and I am a big fan - best phone I've ever owned!,0
4,"Very pleased, great phone so far
  
",12.Dec.19,Yes,Always a Samsung person but didn't want to pay the hefty price tag of one this time. Got the Pixel 3a and have been pleased so far. Better battery life. Only thing it does not have face recognition.,0
5,"Exceeds expectations for the price point
  
",12.Dec.19,Yes,Great phone for the price. I highly recommend staying with the Google ecosystem and if you don't need top of the line features this will do.Some annoying things that aren't as intuitive as the more expensive phones but being able to buy a phone outright and having it work near perfectly is better than being locked into some ridiculous contract longer than you have the phone you're paying for.,1
1,"Speaker gave out after 6 weeks
  
",12.Dec.19,Yes,"The bottom speaker randomly stopped working mid-conversation (on speaker phone). I tried all of the usual troubleshooting steps including a factory reset, but it's still broken. I can't return or exchange it, since it's been more than 30 days, so I'm sending it in to be repaired. This is not a problem I would expect from a barely used phone. I didn't use the speaker very much, and I didn't drop or damage the phone, so I'm blaming it on cheap parts. Phones should last for a couple of years, not 6 weeks.",1

",13.Dec.19,Yes,"If you're thinking about buying this phone, just do it! I researched many budget phones and this is the one that does it all, with the camera to back it up! I've had it for almost a month &amp; just love it!",1

",14.Dec.19,Yes,"Bought in Black Friday to replace my old nexus 5. Nowadays, it_ still difficult to find a full screen protector due to its curve edge and does not be popular in Asian market. Finally got a good one but quite expensive.Upgraded to Android 10 and the camera is amazing.",0

",15.Dec.19,Yes,This was an amazing device but the battery is not what I was hoping. I get on avg. 6 hours of use before I need to charge again,0
2,"Charging problems after less than 6 months
  
",16.Dec.19,Yes,I bought this phone in August 2019. Less than 6 months later it is refusing to charge with the charger it came with. I tried several other chargers with no luck except for a random usb c cable to Samsung charger that worked for all of 5 minutes then stopped. The phone will also not turn off. I turn it off and it reboots 5 secs later...over and over. I did a factory reset but that did not help. Amazon and google have been very helpful. I have third party fix it warranty which I will use soon. I did some searches online and it seems like a few other have this problem and fixing did not help. Sad because I really like my phone. I had a pixel 6p before this. I should not be having this problem 6 months after purchase. Phone looks brand new...no damage whatsoever. It_ definitely a manufacturers fault. Won_ be buying anymore google phones,0

1,"Botched update from android 9 to 10 makes phone calls freeze this phone, DO NOT BUY!
  
",26.Dec.19,Yes,"I purchased this phone and it worked well for the first week or so, until I had to install the android 10 update and incoming phone calls began to freeze the phone.  I spoke to tech support and was told that it was due to this update was due to the update and that there was no way to revert my version without installing software through my PC and entering the boot-loader.  Doing this will be fairly difficult for an inexperienced phone technician and by doing so VOIDS your warranty to fix an update that GOOGLE botched.  If you are capable in downgrading android 10 to 9 the phone could be useful, otherwise stay away.",1
5,"So far, so good!
  
",27.Dec.19,Yes,Have only recently got this phone after ditching iPhone who i have  been using since 2012. Immediately am impressed because it's a fraction of the price for better quality pictures and much better battery life. (was using iPhone X). the Pixel 3a does not get overheated if i am using multiple apps like my iPhone did.  Lightweight and portable which is what I was looking for. I avoided android in the past because I found iPhones a lot easier to navigate but this is super easy and intuitive.,0
2,"Google's warranty policy is one of the worst of all phones.
  
",28.Dec.19,Yes,"The phone is very good. Unfortunately, the speaker never worked correctly and after a few days, it completely failed. I called Google, and they said that this is a known problem. They recommended that I take it to their store that is only 100 miles away. Then they said they could file a warranty, but we would have to mail the phone in first, and they would mail us another one back. We have nowhere to store all of our data, and my wife is nine months pregnant. So we need to have the phone. All the other phones that I've ever purchased (only 2 defective like this), will allow us to put a credit card number on file and send us out the new phone. We could then transfer a data and send the broken phone back.",0
5,"Great Camera
  
",29.Dec.19,Yes,"Amazing camera. Great phone. Fast and capable. The reason I bought it was for the quality camera and I haven't been disappointed. I get compliments on photo quality from people with much more expensive phones, I think that says a lot.",0
5,"The best cellphone I have ever owned.
  
",29.Dec.19,No,"I don't usually spend a lot of money in phone, in fact I refused to pay a bundle to buy a new phone. The maximum you will see me spending on a phone is no more than $300.Go ahead and call me cheap,I choose to spend my money wisely. It wasn't always this way, I have spent in the past almost a thousand of dollars to buy a new flashy phone, to have water damage destroyed it a few months down the road, or accidentally dropped it.Let's talk about the Pixel 3A, I was able to snap a pic of the sky in the middle of the night, I was amazed to see the quality of the outcome.In addition, one of the amazing feature I really enjoy is the automatic"" Now playing song"" the phone can  display any song playing in the background even with the screen is lock.If you are out there in search of a new phone and on a budget, look no further and grab the pixel 3A.",2

5,"Phenominal phone
  
",1.Jan.20,Yes,"Coming from low end phones from several years ago, the jump up to the Pixel 3a is an amazing one. The screen is awesome, fingerprint reader a nice feature (and Lockdown a neat little touch). The battery also lasts quite a long time, I'll go to class for 4 to 5 hours and still have over 90% charge on the battery. The camera is also insanely good, and has replaced my actual camera since they are more or less equivalent now.But I feel the big selling point is Google Assistant, which is insanely helpful and extremely accurate, leaving me very impressed. If you're looking for a good phone, look no further.",0
1,"Phone stopped ringing
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,"Phone looked good on arrival. After a week, the phone stopped ringing. Attending calls over speaker did not work as the caller was unable to hear anything.

4,"Not bad
  
",4.Jan.20,Yes,"Not bad. It was a gift for my mom and she had a older j5 before, so this was a big upgrade. However, she didn't like too big of a change and even though it is still Android, the native settings are a bit different from Google phone and Samsung phone. So after using it for a couple weeks, she didn't like it and asked me to buy her a Samsung phone. I got her the S9 plus which is very comparable with this phone.",0

5,"Excellent camera. Size is right too.
  
",8.Jan.20,Yes,"I liked this so much so that this is my second  one. My daughter liked my first one, so this was a no brainer. I prefer the smaller size phone as it's  easier to hold single handed and reduces the risk of me dropping it. The camera was the selling point for me.",0
