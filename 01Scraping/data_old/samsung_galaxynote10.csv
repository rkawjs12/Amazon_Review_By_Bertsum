",25.Aug.19,No,"Excellent, Beautiful, great features. is this 5G I want a 5G Samsung",2
3,"Camera(s) subpar
  
",26.Aug.19,No,"Beware! The camera is pitiful. It's size is great for editing if you like to play around with photos or draw, make notes, (will work great for my husband's concrete business, you can record video while drawing notations [e.g. floorplans/designs])...but if you enjoy using your phone to take extensive photos, avoid this phone. It struggles to capture good detail. My S5 almost did better. Night mode isn't bad, panorama is cool, but I spent 1,300 on the 5G + version &amp; I am highly disappointed in the camera. Taking outdoor photos, it would blur, pixelate, and simply jumble detail throughout the photo...also had a major issue with depth of field in some shots. These I posted are a few of the best shots I got.On a side note, the Aurora color/silver phone is beautiful, ended up with a white because I orginally returned the first one that I thought had a camera defect. It's that bad.UPDATE: I have discovered it's some HEIC software/engineering in the phone ...apparently apple has done this bs for a while! It's supposed to reduce file size while retaining quality...well it doesn't work!! You can say save in RAW/JPEG format, but it still processes smaller than my S5 did (around 2-2.5MB) simply put: poor quality! However, the bones of the camera(s) itself are good...so I'm hoping a different camera app or even a software update is released later on where people can use the camera to it's full potential!!!",18

4,"Good Phone Coming from an S7... Note 10 Plus Charging Issues
  
",17.Sep.19,Yes,"Waited a long time for a Samsung phone with a Snapdragon 855 (Yes I know the S10, but coming from an S7 want something different). I don't just buy new phones when they come out, I wait until they are much faster and more efficient. Snapdragon 820 14nm chip, 845=10nm, 855=7nm.Pros: AMOLED, Snapdragon 855, 256-512GB Storage, 12GB Ram (Sorry Apple), Wireless AX (aka wifi6)Cons: Weak Charging Detected on Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 @ 80+ percent and will start to discharge your phone while using apps like Google Maps or YouTube. **I used a type A to C USB 3.0 with 56k resistor for charging. Used different QC 3.0 chargers and cables to make sure it was not the accessories. Your finger has to be exactly were the sensor is to unlock the phone. I would prefer it to unlock wherever I place my finger. No Aux (minor, but still useful in my opinion).FYIIf you want full charging capabilities of this phone you need a Power Delivery 3.0 with PPS and a USB type c to c ""e-marker"" cable. **Type c to c does not have a 56k resistors, make sure you get a e-marker cable for USB compliant and safety. To future proof get a USB 3.1 type C to C gen 2. This will support 100w charging and transfer speed of 10Gbps. Not any PD 3.0 Charger will do, you NEED a PD 3.0 with PPS that supports charging @ 10v/4.5a = 45 watts. No the Note 10 Plus will not charge @ 15v/3a standard as of 09/17/2019 (currently none on the market except official, waste of money unless you want to charge from 0-100 in ~30-40min). Once you go OLED screen it is difficult to go back to TN or IPS LCDs. Just make sure you don't set your phone to stay idle for a long time before it unlocks because OLEDs can ""burn in"" similar to plasma tvs. Wireless AX is the new wireless N, better speed and range. AC is speed only, no range.To SamsungI am not sure it is hardware, but if it is software. Please give us a firmware update that allows standard fast charging voltages.",16

1,"phone is not what it seems
  
",23.Sep.19,Yes,"first, the transfer of information from old phone to new phone was unclear as you have to connect to WiFi to do so, except you have to connect to the other phones WiFi. poor instructions there. spent an hour trying to do this until i realized Samsung just doesn't tell you what needs to be done. next, the mail, text messaging, and contacts is kinda confusing. i suppose if you use it long enough you'll get used to it but it really is a terrible system.........it seems each manufacture has a way of making life hard on you. just like us mail, there should be a common way to deliver don't you think? brand a is not better then brand b etc..... i also didnot like the fact that a lot of USB devices are not supported such as microphones and such. great, i can pair an x box controller to it, except i don't use x box or PlayStation. i use pc for gaming. i do use a lot of multi track recording apps though. so if tou like on site recording this aint for you. ok so great, it has a stylus. i can draw and paint which i do in real life. lets face it, this is for people who aspire and not anyone who would take it seriously. good idea though. thing is, now a days most phone manufactures are headed this direction which makes this kinda unnecessary.  i can speak in to most phone and it translates text better. i do like being able to write notes in hand writing and using a pencil, but for the future this just isn't logical or needed considering kids in school don't even need to learn to think anymore if you can grasp the future of education. this phone really doesn't have anything special to offer. its a 1000$ phone just like all the others and does all the same things all everything else on the market. big screen big deal, Cary your laptop if you need a big screen.  do your self a favor, a smaller phone will do everything this does and for less money. dont be a victim of marketing and get the latest greatest bs out ther. you can even get a used phone with a new battery for half the price of this garbage. lat, amazons return and refunds take for ever. once they have your money they send you through hoops and make you wait for any results. this is the second time i have had to deal with a refund like this and the last time i was repeatedly lied to just keep me in check while they took their time. terrible policies and wait times including the automated phone system. redundant questions in an attempt to route your call that just goes to a general customer service rep that asked all the same question all over gain and then goes through a scripted response that left me feeling more or less like a tool and number. nothing personal here, just makes you feel like a robot. thanks for another under par experience amazon. you've ruined my Seattle neighborhood and rent, parking, and food costs have gone through the roof while i struggle to pay for a phone that isn't even worth it.",32
2,"More cons than Pros
  
",26.Sep.19,Yes,"I bet most people are buying this because of the camera and large ram and storage space. I_e had this phone for a couple weeks... and although it looks sleek and awesome... I find that there are many flaws the more I use it. Here are a few good and bad things I find about the phone... more bad than good I suppose.Cons: the processing speed is not as good as my iPhone 7. There_ a little lag depending on what app you use or open up. One of the game I play on mobile ... mobile legend... I can not play using LTE... I have to connect to WiFi to play... where others games I didn_ have to. I find on the threads that many are having the same issue. I_e tried everything to fix the problem but to no solution.Graphic and colors on this phone when I play Mobile Legends... is not vivid and crisp like my old iPhone 7. The colors are brighter but not clear and crisp.The s pen had an issue where it didn_ connect, I had to restart my phone for it to work again.Pictures taken looks great at first, but when upload to Instagram or FB, the quality is not there. The pictures look grainy and not crisp. Kind of blurry, but the original picture saved on phone is nice. Same as when I transfer or send them to another phone. What_ the point of taking great pictures of you can_ share the same quality to social media or other devices?Phone takes great picture of scenery but not good with people in the scenery. The colors pop out but it also makes our skin orange looking. I_ say they had a saturated tone. You will have to go back and edit it to look normal and not like a pumpkin.The screen can not display or scroll down to the full page length on some documents. On my google drive excel, I can not view the full page of my document. I can only scroll down. To like 3/5th a page and it doesn_ let me go all the way down to see the whole thing. Same as when I scroll right. Also, the edge curb is nice but sometime I have to try and look at a decimal number on the edge, which doesn_ display or can be seen fully because it won_ let me scroll right to see wholeDocument. This really got me frustrated, I had to use my old phone to look at the document.There is no USB cable. Both ends on the charging cable are same. I can_ even use an external battery to charge the phone.... probably have to buy an adapter to use external battery charger.Pros:There_ a lot more functions compared to iPhone. Though many are not practical and useful in everyday use.Nice sleek design and color.Large ram and storage space with option of added memory card for more storage space.Nice Dolby sound speakers.Lots of tweaks and twerks to make your phone more accessible to apps and widgets you often use. But also needs some time to set it up... if you know how...Over all I would give this phone a 6/10. Samsung got the right idea, but need improvements in picture vivid and crisp look not only color contrast. Also able to upload same quality to other devices and social media. For the hefty price tag, I would expect to have a better experience the more I use it and not just the first impression and then later discover problems after problems. That_ just frustrating. The large rams and storage space is great but processing speed is more important. The more storage you take up.. the more this phone will lag and glitch. All those space and not enough processing power to run it smoothly.",20

5,"Android 10 update is out as of 12/31/2019 Happy New Year!
  
",15.Oct.19,Yes,"12/31/2019 - well the wait if finally over. the update to android 10 happened nearly a month sooner than scheduled. nice to see Samsung is rolling out OS and security updates sooner and more frequently than in the past! Android 10 brings some nice changes to the handset.12/21/2019 Update - i have only had this for three months now and feel i did make the right decision on getting this model. it enables me to do so much more than any phone i have had before. my hope that i would be able to use this phone in place of my pc for many tasks has worked out better than i'd hoped for. the time i spend working on the computer has easily dropped by half. this really is a great phone in so many respects.Before purchasing this phone the first thing I did was read through and watch a number of reviews for this phone from tech sources, zines, etc. Due to the cost of this item I did a lot more research going into it than I would for most other purchases. I wanted a phone that was well made, would last, could link up easily with my pc or even take its place for many functions especially camera and video. I got all this and more out of this phone! No wonder it is referred to as the 'swiss army knife' for smart phones. Should also note i wasn't surprised to see that every online review of the top android phones for the year had this phone rated #1.Design is fantastic! It looks even better in hand than in photos. Consequently there is no mistaking this phone for others. The screen has lightly slopped or curved edges which complete the near bezel-less design. It is as close to an all display screen phone as I could find. The structure is solid aluminum with no flex whatsoever. Gorilla glass all around and water resistant beyond what most phones are. This can supposedly be submerged in feet of water for many minutes without issue. Overall quality is as good as I expected. It is as close to a perfectly designed phone as I could find at this time.The screen is the largest you can get currently in the U.S. It is large enough for someone like myself with vision problems to see clearly, but not so big as to feel over-sized. See my attached photo of different phones side by side. The resolution and colors are jaw dropping good. I can see details in google earth on my phone zoomed in that I cannot see even when using my pc on a 65 4K screen. That degree of improvement really surprised me. You can adjust the screen resolution from 1080P to 4K UHD+. When researching this phone I saw several ding the phone for having a 60Hz refresh rate and not higher? While higher refresh rates can be nice for gaming otherwise I am very happy with how snappy the screen is to respond as is. All in all I love every aspect of the display.The camera is arguable the best you can get when combined with the stock photo and video editing apps. Be it wide, telephoto, you name it this phone has it. The weakest area here is night photography. Currently there are a couple other flagship phones that do night shots better. That said when it comes to daytime shots those others don_ fare nearly so well. There is so much you can do, customize when it comes to taking photos and vids that words just fail. None of that matters if you don_ have enough space to store your media. With this I have no worries with the base 256GB of storage coupled with an SD card I have 758GB currently on my phone!They killed off the headphone jack! Yep it_ gone on the note10+ but not the note10? Lots of excuses as to why but real reason is they want you to buy their Samsung buds. I tried a generic brand dongle for my wired earbuds and it failed miserably. I then tried the Samsung version and got very good audio quality. IMHO that absolutely should_e been included with the phone. Currently I_ using both my Bose QC20_ which are wired and a pair of wireless Amazon buds. They both sound excellent, no complaints whatsoever for audio quality. I still want the audio jack back though.Battery life and charging are the best I have ever had. Comes with a 28 watt charger that will take me from 80-100% in about 11 minutes. Even after a hard day_ use I have yet to dip below 50%. From my research it states and others have confirmed a 0-100% charge time of one hour. Unless you travel a lot, live in airports I don_ see the need for the $50 optional charger that won't do much more IMHO. The battery is the largest capacity I could get in a phone here and was also a factor in my purchase. It has never once gotten hot to the touch. Only a couple times has it gotten slightly warm and that was when I had it charging while using as a video monitor at the same time. It has the fastest wireless charging rate of any Samsung phone at 15W. The smaller note10 is 10W and the smaller of the Galaxy Note series is 5W for comparison. You can also do reverse charging, one of two currently made phones that can do that. Keep in mind doing so you get a slow charge but it works if ever needed.You get an 855 processor, vapor chamber cooling, base 256 GB of memory and 8 GB of ram. You also have expandable storage making it a true storage monster. As said great for anyone taking photos or vids. With all that underneath the hood you can truly multitask. Open as many apps as you want, I_e never slowed it down one bit. It has enough horses to work easily with its system to connect to pc_. There you can use your phone through your pc. You can grab and drag pics or files from one to another. All my office apps work on it. I should make some mention of the S Pen. It is great for doing any work on the phone. It enables precise work. Be it photo editing or just clicking on a box on a website, it absolutely improves the entire experience. You can do other things with but my take those are kind of gimmicky.The software, apps are very impressive. Coming off a near stock android experience it took me a bit to get comfortable with OneUI 1.0 meshed with android 9 but now I love it. I have already had several updates with OneUI 1.5 now on my phone. Android 10 has already gone out to some with the rest of us by years end. But back to the custom software, there are so many many things and ways to customize this phone to fit your specific wants and needs I cannot say enough good. Things like being able to set a safe location so your phone doesn_ lock at home. Similarly set it up so it_ safe when connected to a Bluetooth device, for me I set our vehicles as that so they don_ lock inside. My favorite of all is the Edge lighting. That takes the place of the old flashing LED notification light. Edge lighting is what you want from it. Set which apps you want to use with it besides calls. Get a text message the led show is on or not you customize it all. Colors, how it displays, where, how long, how wide. It not only looks amazing but it is much more visible than just one lonely LED light. You can even minimize it to just go around the camera punch hole. Security via pin, pic or sonar sensor. Samsung pay which unlike google pay will work on old stripe type machines. So you can use the Samsung pay feature in spots you_ never think you could. Seriously there are so many ways to customize the software I am still learning new things even now.Things I didn_ like, no 3.5mm audio jack made worse by no included dongle. The phone is beautiful to look at but the thing is slippery as all get out to hold onto thanks to being all glass. I put a case on the back immediately for just that reason. I don_ like having Samsung pay on the bottom to activate with a swipe up. Problem is if you have gestures enabled half the time instead of going to your home screen, especially if locked, you end up opening the pay app instead. S Pen gimmicks to me are a waste. My edge lighting didn_ work at first. I ended up having to get the edge lighting fix and edge lighting plus from the galaxy store (free). Point being it should have worked straight out of the box but minor gripe. They put a screensaver on at the factory, unlike any phone I_e had before, and didn_ mention anywhere in the docs or packaging it was there. So I thought it was just another piece of the many protective clear plastic stickies you remove when unboxing, it wasn_. They fixed that self-inflicted issue on the Samsung fold but not with the Note10+?Minor gripes aside this is the best, most capable phone I_e ever owned. It is one of the rare phones out that truly allows you to supplement many things before you could only do on a PC. The extra screen size is not wasted. I don_ notice the camera cutout and that extra size makes it much easier to use with my poor vision. This phone is one I really can do work on without difficulty. I love the screen, the look, the hardware, the imaging setup.I would recommend this phone to anyone at this time based on my personal experience with it even at this price point. It does so much and is built so well. I fully expect it to stand up to the test of time.**FYI - The Note line is merging with the Galaxy S series to be formally announced 2/2020 along with a massive bump in the camera sensor size.",23

3,"Before you SWITCH, read:
  
",22.Oct.19,Yes,"My review is aimed at those trying to switch from a more bare-bone android experience (or any other phone OS). If you you have  had a samsung phone for a few generation then this may not apply to you.-Samsung is trying to create its own environment, so depending on your situation,  switching may be difficult. I come a nexus 6p (google phone by Huawei, 2015*).  So my android experience was bare bones, and I liked the simplicity of it. Samsung on the other hand wants to trap you with all of own its applications, and while they are good, they are not the best. On top of that, it is not easy to uninstall or disable them (it is doable but you'd need time and above average technical skills to do it). An example of this is their own messaging,  keyboard, e-mail, browser, and assistant application (most essential applications). It'd be nice if they let you disable them, but you are stuck with them (unless you choose to use a PC software or other methods to disable them).-the specs of the phone are impressive, however, you do not get it all. in order to conserve battery the default of the phone is less than the top specs. for example the screen has 3 different setting for its resolution. So if you want the best resolution, you'd have to manually change it at the cost of more battery usage. Also, while using the phone with no apps in the background (aside from system apps and whatever runs behind the curtains), the phone was using an average of 6gb of ram. I am not an expert on this, but I think that that is too much ram being used for not doing anything. In my brain, the 12gb of ram being offered are not really 12gb of ram if the phone needs 6 of them to just run things in the background (again I am not an expert on this lol).-Camera si impressive, but it is definitely based on needs. the phone recommends using 4k 30 fps or video stabilizer wont work as well, I guess that is okay if the phone is placed on a tripod and not carried while videoing?  other than that, I was not all that impressed with the camera(s). My old phone took pictures that were good, this one took pictures were ""gooder*"" lol.-The pen. I come from a phone that did not have it, so idk, the pen is just there. I haven't really use it. I haven't had the chance to be like, ""hold on let me take my pen out so I can write down whatchu saying."" I haven't met anyone that does it either lol. Maybe if you are in school (but if you are in school and you can afford this phone, good for you!)?-depending on your carrier, you may or may not be able to use wifi to make/recieve calls or send/receive MMS, so you'd have to use your plan's services and data. This is big deal for me because there are places where I can only get wifi and not service. or there are times where I only want to use wifi.-In conclusion, switching to this phone is a big deal so be prepared for a lot of change if you choose to do it. The phone looks fancy, performs nicely, and is great. But at the end of the day, that is pretty much every phone out there now.",11

5,"Stunning Phone
  
",29.Dec.19,Yes,"Got it for my brother for Christmas. It's an absolutely amazing phone and it works extremely well, charges insanely fast, amongst other things. It is a bit of a shame they removed the headphone Jack, but it's a non issue since these came bundled with the galaxy buds which are also phenomenal earbuds. 10/10 would recommend. Stop wasting for such a premium price on an iPhone when you can get this flagship for around the same price and be able to do so much more.",0
5,"Love the Galaxy 10 Note plus!
  
",29.Dec.19,Yes,"Love it!  And, since the phone is unlocked, we have the option to go to any Cellular provider of our choosing.  The Sim card was free from our Cellulr provider and we did not have to change our plan. The phone is awesome! I Love being able to use the pen to snap a picture remotely.",0
4,"Good phone but just to long.
  
",30.Dec.19,Yes,Solid phone but it's just too big.  I have the S10+ and it's a good size but the note 10 is just to big and especially too long/tall..  I would get the thee smaller note 10 but it does not have an sd card slot.,0

5,"Everything
  
",5.Jan.20,Yes,Very good,0
5,"The best
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,"What_ to say? It_ a Note 10. Of course it_ awesome. My wife loves it and says it does way more than she ever expected. Super fast charging is a plus. Puts my iPhone X to shame. Just wish this Note 10 had a microSD slot like the Note 10 Plus, which is the only negative I can find.",0
1,"Screen scratches super easy
  
",9.Jan.20,No,Your screen will get scratched just by the meat force of the wind as u hold ur phone. These galaxy screens are the cheapest poorest worst screens in the history of man. Samsung should be ashamed of themselves for making such a baby soft screen it_ mind blowing. It doesn_ make sense. You suck Samsung,0
