1,"Sounds great but connection is a true nightmare
  
",12.Mar.19,Yes,The sound is amazing. So much better than my Echo speaker (obviously.)The connection gets worse each day. I never had any problem with a device staying connected to my network so I_ not sure If I got a defective one but I_ about 2 days from returning this. The sonos app is terrible. I wrote to them for help which is my last try before returning. This speaker won_ stay connected and then the process to get it reconnected only works if I unplug it and connect it directly to the router. If you are planning on keeping it right next to your router maybe it would be tolerable to constantly go through this?Alexa is slower to respond on this device as well.,117
5,"Quality Speakers!
  
",13.Mar.19,Yes,"Update:I_e loved this speaker since I purchased it. I haven_ experienced connection issues like others.My experience has improved ten fold with Google Assistant. Alexa sometimes needed a reboot after voice went offline. Not once with GA. I have both Alexa and GA powering my setup. Best of both worlds.I can't compare this to the 1st generation Sonos One, but I know it now has BLE and a faster processor. The sound is clear. I also have multiple Play One speakers... Not a big difference in sound.My purpose in buying was the ability to use AirPlay. Playing music from a wider collection. Not locked into a specific app when playing from multiple libraries. Then the ability to group my nom AirPlay speakers.The biggest plus for me... Not only can I group all my Sonos speakers. I can also play through my sound bar that is connected to my Apple TV 4k. This has given me the ability to play the same music throughout the entire house. Extremely easy to setup. I haven't experienced any dropouts. Strong signal from all access points.I love Sonos for producing quality speakers. Easy to setup and use. For a blind individual like myself, this is appreciated. I love tech, and gadgets.... It's refreshing when a manufacturer produces a product that does what it says it will.I can definitely recommend this product.",67
3,"Great sound, but Alexa integration needs work
  
",18.Mar.19,Yes,"The sound quality is great, far better than any other smart speaker I've tried, but the Alexa integration is awful. It won't respond to voice commands the first two or three tries, and the audible chime doesn't seem to work half the time. Hoping it's a software issue that will improve over time, but given the One has been on the market for awhile, not hopeful.",24
5,"Impressive loud sound
  
",20.Mar.19,Yes,Alexa works seemlessly with speakers. I have a pair that I use for surround sound with a playbar. They can get REALLY LOUD but don_ lose sound quality. Expensive but I know I_ getting the quality.,1
5,"Best speaker ever.
  
",22.Mar.19,Yes,Sounds great easy to load songs on to the app.  Love it.,2
2,"False Advertising Alert!
  
",25.Mar.19,Yes,"I bought a few of these sonos gen 2 units and set them up. Easy breezy to do. Ran into a small hiccup with setting up Alexa but that was user error and I figured it out. It_ just a multi multi multi step process I wasn_ anticipating. The speakers are great. I love that I can take calls and not rely on regular Bluetooth speakers. However! I bought these with the intention to not have to purchase the amazon echo or dot or whatever because of sound quality. I_ finding that the Alexa function is incredibly limited. It WAS advertised that Alexa voice calls were unsupported. BUT it had no mention of other things, such as routines and other automatic processes. Why can_ I have an Alexa Routine work with SONOS? That_ one of Alexa_ features that are wonderful. Aaaaaaand now I have three speakers that are as helpful as coasters, in my opinion, with simple functionality that isn_ possible. This unit is 10 stars if they can fix with a firmware update. Otherwise I will likely send them back. It_ just not worth the cost to have limited Alexa functionality. It_ pitched as _se Alexa for everything but voice calls!  Not true.Update: after three days? All of the speakers are out of connection and don_ work with Alexa or playing audio in general. I think there is a bug they need to fix where the device doesn_ connect to WiFi properly. I_ no tech wizard but I like to think I know mostly everything when it comes to easy-to-use devices and setups. I trouble shooted as best I could with customer service. Still no bueno.",149
4,"Great sound. Needs an update regarding Alexa
  
",2.Apr.19,Yes,Alexa app glitchy and somewhat functions.,2
2,"Was awesome for 10 minutes, reset, repeat
  
",8.Apr.19,Yes,"My wife's brother has two Gen 1 of these so I bought one for my wife's birthday. Followed instructions, got it set up. Worked great. Then 10 to 20 minutes later Alexa would say ""I'm having trouble understanding"" Reset it. Re-set it up, same thing. Over and Over. Called Sonos help number and the wait was 45 minutes. No. Returned for the the Amazon speaker which is half the price. Sonos, get your stuff right before releasing.",68
1,"ALEXA VOICE CONTROL DOES NOT WORK OUTSIDE OF USA!
  
",9.Apr.19,Yes,Do not buy if you plan on controlling directly with Alexa Voice Control outside of the USA.,11
5,"great audio quality
  
",10.Apr.19,Yes,Amazing surround sound. Only able to use it with apple tv though. Don't buy it thinking on connecting with tv or any other device in the house only works with Airplay devices. But besides that is a great speaker.,0
5,"It's wonderful.
  
",12.Apr.19,Yes,Sonos is wonderful!! I have filled both my homes with this product and could not be more pleased!,0
5,"Worth the Extra Money over the Sonos 1
  
",16.Apr.19,No,"I went back and forth on the Sone One vs the Play 1.I ended up buying the One.  Because the built in Alexa is not full function and has the annoying beep that you cannot shut off, I silenced the Alexa on this unit.  I use my actual Alexa devices to interact with Alexa.  You may ask why then did I buy this if I do not sue the Alexa that is built in? The answer is simple. The Alexa capability is a software function and I am betting that will improve over time with new releases. This unit has better smarts than the Paly 1 and is more likely and more capable to receive updates; both Alexa and just normal Sonos updates.  If and when the Alexa function catches up, I will turn it back on.I also preferred the aesthetics.  The all black is cleaner than the black/gray.  The touch buttons are superior in look and feel to traditional push buttons.  Overall, it is a more elegant looking speaker.As far as sound goes, it is quite good for my needs.  If you want a large and loud sound these are not for you. For me,I have a few these in difference rooms and I can keep it a low volume and yet hear the music fine in every room.  For gatherings, I don't have to have it blasting in one room and too low in another. I can keep a consistent sound level through all rooms.The Sonos App is great to organize play lists.  I general just control it with Alexa but use the Sonos App to manage long playlist.  If you keep the Rime Music subscription that is also a convenient way to manage playlists and favorites.I also have the Lutron Caseta home system and hence there is some integration that I use with that.  The Lutron Pico Audio remote is a nice thing to have to control the unit from a distance without having to talk to Alexa.",1
3,"Bad connection, great sound.
  
",18.Apr.19,Yes,"If you are getting a Alexa speaker. This is it. The sound is amazing.I have a HomePod at home, and I got this for my GFs place. Sound is real good.But.I got it for Alexa, she_ very into that eco system. She has a normal echo already, and it worked great. The Sonos is alright at best, we first try to connect them both to extend the Alexa reach, it worked. But the Sonos looses connection constantly and needs to be setup again.Since I bought it 2 months ago I have set it up more than 20 times for her. I was hoping it was just a software issue, but it_ still to be fixed.The nights when it just randomly says _ost connection is getting annoying.",25
2,"Alexa integration is a joke.
  
",20.Apr.19,No,Alexa integration is a joke. Good luck with that.Sound quality is mediocre at best if you actually know what good sound is.This is a speaker for background use when trying a hamburger or falling asleep.The Sonos app also needs much improvement.,4
1,"Stay Away - Only plays music through proprietary app!
  
",27.Apr.19,No,These not-so-cheap speakers only play MUSIC through their proprietary app.  You can't connect them to your TV or your computer.  Sent them back on day 1.  Sticking with Bose.,7
5,"Seamless integration with existing speaker Sonos system.
  
",29.Apr.19,Yes,"We bought these to have music in our courtyard and on our patio. Upon powering up and pressing the button, you use your phone/tablet_ sonos app to configure the speakers (room name, mono use or a stereo pair).  It took just a few moments to get them dialed in.  Then, when you decided to play music, you can choose one room or group them together to play the same tunes everywhere. Alexa is handy for controlling the music when you_e outside and don_ want to carry around a phone or tablet.",6
4,"Excellent but could use some tweaks
  
",5.May.19,Yes,Sound quality is excellent for the price.  I think the echo devices that I replaced with the sinus units were more accurate etc. the sonus seems to lose network more easily than a dot even though they are in the same location. But luv the sonus.,3
1,"Device Looses connection randonly,  2.4ghz wifi?
  
",8.May.19,Yes,"I wanted to like this device.  However, the wifi connection is unstable even right beside any of my AP's.  The alexa app often says ""uh ohh""For $200 you'd expect that the device would work,  it doesn't.I never  got around to toying with the other Sonos integrations before sending it back (a week of testing)",16
5,"From frustration to perfection!
  
",16.May.19,Yes,"First off, the sound is great!  I use this speaker in a slightly non-traditional way: we already have the Sonos playbar in front of the TV.  But we sit about 15' back from that. I wanted a speaker in between me and the wife, so we could better hear what's going on.  So, discussed this on a chat-call with Sonos and they recommended this.  All well and good, except I couldn't get it to work.  Luckily, Sonos allows you send a diagnostic of your set-up directly to them via smartphone, detailing what you have etc.  They diagnosed that my router had a setting deep in its controls that prevented the speaker from joining in (there's NO way I wold ever have found this myself).  So, the speaker was working.  But I wanted to to match exactly what was coming out of the playbar.  Sonos explained how to ""group"" the speakers and, subsequently, how to keep them grouped permanently.  The smartphone app makes it easy to adjust the volume level coming out of both speakers, so it creates the sound level most comfortable for you.  Bottom line: it's wonderful!  But kudos to the Sonos support staff.  They were quick to respond and very precise in their fixes.  They turned what was becoming a frustration into perfection.  This is hands-down the best way to listen to your TV!",13
1,"Playlist Annoyance on a Meh smart speaker.
  
",18.May.19,Yes,"Seriously just want to be done with Sonos. Was excited at first but the introduction of the Sonos Playlist is pure cancer. I am listening to a song from the radio. We will take Google service for example. I can add it to my Google library which throws the song into oblivion or I can add it to my Sonos Playlist. Whoopie. I can't use Sonos Playlist anywhere except a place where I have Sonos. So I'm in my car... Nope, on my head phones, nope. At work... Still nope. I want to add songs that I listen to, to whatever Playlist I want. It would be so simple and it used to do this. Click add to Google or whatever Playlist and then choose one.All I now get is Sonos. By doing this you take away my ability to be mobile and convent which I believe is the corner stone to the product. Alexa or Google assistant and extremely slow and most of the time doesn't recognize my voice if the music volume is up.Last piece I know Sonos Playlist is good for home allowing me to utilize multiple different playforms of music. But it should be an option not the only thing.Please fix this and I will update my review.",34
3,"Historically lacking product support over time.
  
",21.May.19,No,"Love the sound. Easy setup. Wi-Fi connectivity is finicky. The worst and I mean the worst thing about this brand, and it's scary, is down the road they just decide to not support the product and it is worthless. It has happened to me on two different items in the past. One day there is an update and all of a sudden it no longer recognizes their own product on the network. Their response, we no longer support that. You now have several hundred dollars in garbage. It is a terrible corporate decision.",3
3,"Alexa support is prehistoric..
  
",21.May.19,No,"Sorely lacking for Alexa functionality. It's really like having Alexa when she was first released years ago. Very basic things like time or weather are fine, but everything else is either unavailable or unreliable. Sending messages to kids rooms or playing music on all speakers... Nope.. wish I had returned when I had a chance.",4
5,"simply a game changer
  
",23.May.19,Yes,no doubt the very best speaker on the market. it is so good the only downside is that you will want the entire system - its hard to listen to music or watch shows any other way now,0
4,"The best multi room speaker
  
",27.May.19,Yes,"Not going to praise sound quality and design, it's all top. What I'll do instead is describe some tech limitations I didn't know about when was buying my Ones.1. AirPlay doesn't work when Ones are connected to the Bar or Beam as surround speakers.2. Google Assistant's Voice Match technology is not supported. So if you're using different Spotify accounts for different family members. Voice Match is amazing functionality to avoid your Spotify music suddenly stopped because someone else requested music with voice at home. Also, you can't ask for personalized routines because the speaker doesn't know who's talking to it. Sonos/Google, please doesn't do this to us!3. One can't be paired with any other speaker but One in a stereo pair.4. I don't know if it's Airplay or Sonos, but initiating playback through Airplay takes a while. Like 5-10 seconds or so. Annoying.Despite found limitations, want to buy more. Great design and sound wins.",6
5,"Alexa, come on!
  
",29.May.19,Yes,"The integration is something we are still struggling with, but the sound is great!",0
3,"a great idea with serious software issues
  
",1.Jun.19,Yes,"Depending on when you ask me, I will either tell you I love these speakers or kind of hate them with a white hot burning passion. I've been looking for a whole-house sound system for a while. I have a very strong mesh WiFi network, so when I saw these speakers and the reviews talking about how great the sound was, I decided to take the plunge and purchased a bunch of them (10) to hang everywhere around my house, basement to second floor.At first, I absolutely loved them. Their sound, as reported by others, is excellent. And the addition of Alexa made controlling them so convenient. I really fell in love with them and started telling everyone about how great they were. Then, about 4 weeks in, I started running into issues which have plagued me ever since, and I can't seem to get the system back into a stable state.The issue seems to stem from the integration with the Amazon Alexa software. The first odd thing I noticed was that occasionally, the speakers seem to just turn dumb, for lack of a better term. You wake them to ask for something and they ding indicating they are listening, but no matter how carefully you articulate your request, they pause for a few seconds and then just die. Or they respond to confirm a request for something that doesn't even remotely sound like what you requested. Or, perhaps most annoyingly, they respond correctly and start playing the thing you requested for about 10 seconds before just fading out and stopping without explanation.I have tried restarting the speakers, my cell phone, my WiFi, and my Internet router, all to no avail. When the speakers just decide to not work for some reason it seems you have no choice but to wait for 6 or 7 hours or so for them to start working again, for reasons as mysterious as the reasons they stopped. I can't tell you how aggravating that is, particularly since these speakers are supposed to be a nice mid-level solution that should just work.Another annoyance I've noticed is that occasionally one of the speakers will simply drop from the Sonos software, causing that speaker to be completely unresponsive and uncontrollable no matter what you do. The only way to re-add it to a group when this happens is to stop all activity on every speaker and have them do their best impressions of expensive bricks until you open the Sonos software and find that the missing speaker has reappeared. Which leads to another bug, which is that sometimes the speakers will simply decide to not take commands, verbal or in the Sonos software. You tell them to 'stop' or 'cancel' and they don't. So you grab your phone and open the Sonos app, click on the speaker group, and click the stop button and...nothing happens. Just keeps right on playing. It's absolutely maddening to be ignored like this by your ""digital assistant""; you are often left with no choice but to go around unplugging speakers around the house to get everything back to a base status.These problems could be YMMV type issues; plenty of reviews practically glow when talking about them. It could also be that by buying so many I exposed myself to more hassle than most and would have been better off purchasing fewer of them and accepting some sound gaps. But my feeling is that as these are not cheap speakers, and that since at least according to the product literature I should be able to setup the speakers in a configuration like this, it shouldn't  be this much hassle.My gut feeling is that the integration between Sonos and Amazon is not very stable and that problems crop up over time. I say this because I have noticed that Alexa updates seem to happen at a breakneck pace, which introduces weirdness all on its own. For example, for over a month I could ask Alexa to 'play NPR' and the speaker would open the radio station without issue. Then one day the exact same request prompted a series of questions about where I lived, which station identifier I wanted, etc. What the heck? Why take something that worked and make it more complex for no reason whatsoever?The bottom line is that when they do work they are amazing. I just wish Sonos and Amazon could get some more stability into their products, because otherwise this will never be more than a niche product.Edit 12/15/2019:I was going to ignore the comment by the manufacturer, but since this is the season when people might be spending a lot of money on these things, I'm just going to post a quick follow-up. In between the quietly sponsored 5 star ""reviews"", manufacturers do damage control PR when someone does post a negative comment about their products. The responses are meant to convey the idea of 'sure, here is a negative comment, but we're nice guys and look how politely we listened to his complaint and offered to help; this negative experience was probably not even our fault and in any case it certainly won't happen to you.'So here's my truth: I did take them up on their suggestion to call for support. It was an agonizing multi-hour call where they had me repeat the exact same troubleshooting steps over and over and over again, right down to connecting the devices to the local LAN for setup and using a computer connected to the LAN to run tests against them. Nothing they did fixed the issues, but the technician had no strategy but to keep asking me to repeat the same steps until, after 6 repetitions or so, I gave up in frustration. And honestly, I think that was his goal. He certainly wasn't learning anything by asking me to repeat the steps ad nauseam when we were receiving the exact same results each time. I think the idea was that if they could make me give up in frustration first, they could frame the experience as me giving up when all they wanted to do was help. It's actually clever, in it's own infernal little way.The reality is that if you read commentary around the web, you'll see that I'm not the only one reporting weird, glitchy behavior out of these devices, particularly if you are using the Alexa interface as opposed to the Google one. The rate of issues also seems to be affected by how many you have on your network. One or two, and you might not have many issues. More, and the odds seem to shift considerably. This product has (in my opinion) a hardware or software (or both) issue that causes the speakers to drop out periodically without explanation, occasionally flat out refuse to join a network, or go dead to commands for random periods of time. I can't say that if you buy these you absolutely will have a problem, but I feel comfortable saying that there is a chance, and it might be higher than you would be comfortable with, given the expense of the units.",14
5,"Excellent, complete home audio system. Alexa/Google Assistant available, but not yet fully capable
  
",1.Jun.19,No,"When I had just purchased a home, I was looking into having it wired for whole-house audio. Looking into multi-room systems on Amazon, it was apparent to me that it wouldn't be cheap: cost of the speakers, controllers, PLUS cost of running wires throughout the house. When I saw the SONOS PLAY:1 promotions, I found its wireless solution to be more cost effective, and with better speakers to boot. I have since tried the SONOS ONE speakers that were realized in late 2017. In 2019, the Sonos ONE (Gen 2) was released, which currently offers no significant advantages over its predecessor except for 2 areas: faster processor (for future expansion) and Bluetooth LE (for speaker setup via Bluetooth at this time).Below are the pros and cons that led me to decide for the Sonos system.NOTE 1: a Sonos BRIDGE is NOT needed to use the PLAY:1 or ONE. See the INSTALLATION section of this review.NOTE 2: the PLAY:1 is the same as the ONE without voice and touch integration. As such, the PLAY:1 is less expensive.NOTE 3: the ONE (Gen 2) is virtually the same as the ONE (Gen 1) except for a faster processor and Bluetooth LE included. This makes it slightly more future proof.PROS- Hi-Fi. Speakers sound better than the multi-room, wired systems I looked at for less than $500.- Resale Value. Wired speakers don't add much resale value to your house. So, why spend $1000s, only to leave the audio system behind when you sell the property or move? With wireless, I could take my expensive speakers with me to my new home.- Freedom to move around.With wireless, you are free to take the speakers anywhere you want throughout the whole house. For neighborhood block parties, I could even hook up the speakers to an extension cord out to the street, and stream music from my home. Or take it outside to your backyard. They are moisture-proof, but I wouldn't use them as permanent outdoor speakers unless you enclose them in protective casings.NOTE on wireless: each SONOS component is its own wireless client and repeater. Sonos wireless is a private, wireless ""mesh"" system, separate from your home WiFi. What does that mean to you? It routes music through its own wireless, leaving your home WiFi untouched. There's an additional benefit for that, as I'll explain after the installation note below. Most of the Sonos components (PLAY:1 and ONE are NOT one of them) have 2 network ports. This means, you can plug in the component into the network jack, and use the 2nd one on the speaker to connect your laptop.- Alexa integration: the speakers now support voice control, though it is a work-in-progress. Sonos updates the capabilities via software updates over time. Google Assistant support is scheduled to come in 2019, making the ONE a more desirable option than having a Google Home and Amazon Echo in the house. I do get frustrated far more often with Alexa not understanding me or my request. My whole family enjoys Google Assistant's better answers and ability to understand us. We can't wait for Sonos to bring the Google Assistant to the ONE. Note: we aren't fans of the Alexa on the Echo Dot either. Google Assistant is just that much better at recognizing commands and providing data. However, Alexa is a bit more advanced in the automation space. Pros and Cons, but that's for another review.[Update 5/2019 Google Assistant integration: it finally arrived and wow, the voice recognition is SO MUCH better! Our whole family is actually happy. Note that Assistant is not yet as fully capable as on Android smartphones or Google Home, but it is sufficient for answering queries and controlling smart devices.]INSTALLATION: First, the tech talk. You need 1 Sonos component to be plugged in to your home network (any of the PLAY speakers, Soundbar, Bridge, etc.) So, as an example, you must plug in either the BRIDGE or the ONE to your network with a network cable. This turns that component into a wireless access point (or as consumers tend to call it, a ""Wifi router"".) All other Sonos components will now be able to wirelessly talk to that plugged-in device. No other Sonos component has to be plugged in, as long as it's within wireless range of the plugged-in one. Should a component in your house be too far away (say, your garage) from the plugged-in one, you can connect it to your network via cable, if available, or set up a Sonos BRIDGE (or any other Sonos speaker) wirelessly somewhere between the plugged-in one and the Garage speaker. The BRIDGE or other speaker strengthens the wireless from the plugged-in one, and extends the range to the one in the Garage. Each Sonos component is both a wireless client, and a wireless access point/repeater. Each component talks to each other in a mesh network. Think of a spider net. Any part that is touched vibrates to the rest of the net.Tech-talk aside, think about this: One person (Person 1) is at a corner of the house. When he shouts, the person in the garage (Person 2) can't hear Person 1. The only way Person 1 can talk to 2, is to pick up the phone (talking over a wired connection, or plugging a distant Sonos component to the wired network) or having Person 3 stand between them (having a Sonos component physically be between both speakers) and relaying the information back and forth (what WiFi mesh would do). So, with each Sonos component/speaker, the Sonos wireless range gets extended.With the Sonos wireless mesh, you could humorously place a few speakers into each house in the neighborhood, and suddenly play the same music through each home. Try that with Bluetooth speakers. You wouldn't be able to.WiFi mesh TIP: if you have an Android device, you can Google ""Android devices on SonosNet"", and you will see instructions on how to use your Sonos wireless network (""SonosNet"") to connect your Android phone/tablet. This allows you to use your mobile device further away from your home WiFi. This has disadvantages and advantages out of the scope of this review. I decided not to use SonosNet for my tablets.NOTE: a Sonos BRIDGE is NOT needed to use the ONE. Just plug in the ONE to the wired network (ie your router), and it will work just fine. You still control it with the Sonos App from your mobile device. Once the ONE is plugged in, you can add other Sonos components to the system. A BRIDGE is NOT needed for that either. It's only needed if you want to extend the Sonos wireless range to a farther part of your house or yard for $50 vs buying another PLAY speaker for $100+)- Small size. The BRIDGE is about the same size as an Apple TV/Roku/WD TV Live. The ONE is about 2-3 of them stacked on top of each other. The ONE has a fairly hefty weight, a good sign of the good sound coming from its components.- Ease of Pairing. To pair other Sonos components (or with the Sonos Controller App), simply hit the Play/Volume Up button on the speaker, and the same combination on the other speakers. If pairing with the BRIDGE, hit the pair button on that component.- LED. The Bright LED can be configured to turn on/off via the Sonos app.- Ease of music sync.You can use the free Sonos app for your Android, iOS (iPhone/iPad/iPod), Windows Phone, Mac/Windows laptop/tablet (sadly, no Windows Store app yet) to control how the speakers play: you can easily choose which speakers to pair/unpair into groups. Grouping the speakers allows you to play the same music on those speakers. You can have up to 32 separate groups. You can also individually control each speaker from the app. Each group's volume is controlled by the Sonos app. So, if Speaker 1 is set to 50% volume, and Speaker 2 is set to 25%, lowering the volume by 5% will lower Speaker 1 to 45%, and 2 to 20%.Once music is playing, you can leave the house, and it will continue to play -- as long as the music source is not coming from that mobile device (meaning: if you're playing MP3s from your phone, and your phone leaves, it will stop playing. But if you started Pandora from your phone, or you told the speaker to play music off one of your network shares, it will continue playing since the source is coming from a device that's still at home.)PARTIES: one cool feature is that once you download the Sonos Controller app and pair it to one of the Sonos speakers (which authorizes the app/phone to talk to your Sonos system -- this prevents unauthorized people outside your home from controlling your speakers), each device can control the playlist. So, if you have guests coming over, and each guest downloads and authorizes the Sonos app to your system, each guest can now add/remove songs from the queue. Everybody can now be a DJ.- Stereo pairing for ONE.You can take two ONE speakers and set them up as Left &amp; Right channels for stereo output. WARNING: you cannot pair ONE and the older PLAY:1 for stereo. You either have to use two PLAY:1 or two ONE.- Expandability.Sonos did a smart thing. They released the less expensive PLAY:1/ONE to wet your/my appetite. As you use the system, you will likely buy more Sonos components to expand your sound system, resulting in more revenue for the company. You can add any Sonos component to your system, and they will all work in harmony. You can set up a complete home theater system that way too. I know, sounds pricey. It is. But it still is cheaper than having your whole house wired with nice speakers.- Alarm/Sleep timer.You can set up each speaker (or Group of speakers) to play music at a specific time, day, and volume (Alarm) from a specific source for a specified amount of time. Or you can also set a Sleep timer to play music for a specific number of minutes to ease you into sleep. I love getting waken up by mellow music (ie. Norah Jones) in the morning, and when I leave the home, I don't have to worry about turning off the speakers. It'll automatically turn off after the 45 minutes I set up for the alarm.- Sound. Sound quality is quite good. I will leave you with the reviews by others to read more about that. With the Sonos app, you can control Bass, Treble, and volume. I have the speakers play between 15% to 25% volume in each room -- they are plenty loud enough. Setting them to 100% can be heard through the whole house -- and the potential for your neighbors to complain. Even at low volume, the sound is very good. It's definitely better than most Bluetooth speakers. If you put the ONE in the corner of a room, the sound seems a bit more muffled due to the amplification of the Bass by the walls on both ends. You can fix this by adding more Treble, or by moving the speaker away from the corner.- Design. The ONE and BRIDGE are beautiful devices. They don't look out-of-place in my home. I bought the White ones.- Capacitive touch control: works very well.CONSI couldn't find many cons with the ONE. But here are some that have annoyed me.- Lack of screw hole for mounting onto stands like the PLAY:1. The ONE replaced the PLAY:1's screw hole with the power button. As such, an entirely new stand needs to be purchased, and Sanus makes one that accommodates the ONE and Play:1.- Cost. The Sonos system is expensive. Just look at the price of the other components. Holy moly. Still, if you were to wire your house with Bose speakers, the Sonos system is comparatively inexpensive. Again, I chose Sonos because wiring the house won't add much resale value. I like the idea of being able to take my Sonos with me to my new home.- Sonos App Interface. The app is clunky and looks outdated. It took me a while to figure out where to go to do what (and I love gadgets/toys. I'm a technology tinkerer!). It's not very user friendly.- Music sources. Not all apps can play to the Sonos speakers. You have to use the Sonos App, add the approved source to it, then you can play from that source. I wish you could re-route any audio from any device to the speakers. Pandora, network shares (NAS), iTunes, TuneIt Radio (built-in), iPod/iPad/iPhone, media files on your own Android/Windows device are all possible sources. At one point (if I remember correctly), my not-so-tech-savvy dad was able to beam his iPad's YouTube sound to the speakers without using the Sonos App. I didn't get a chance to verify how he did it, but I did see the ONE being available as a target on his iPad. Perhaps it was playing via the DLNA protocol. Either way, that was neat.- Input source. I wish that the ONE had a Line-in/Aux port so that you can connect any music source to it for playback, such as your TV or existing home entertainment system. Yes, the Sonos CONNECT takes care of that, but look at the price of that component! Even then, the CONNECT doesn't support SPDIF/Optical input.Weren't it for the Amazon/Target promotions on Black Friday, I would have been EXTREMELY hesitant to buy these expensive speakers. I bought two ONE during the promotion. With that said, overall, I'm quite pleased with the purchase. It came out cheaper than wiring the house, and I get to control my music from any of the mobile devices. That's neat. Lower the prices of your other components, Sonos! I hope for increased competition in the market to drive the prices down -- as of today, I'm not aware of any good, alternate, wireless HiFi solution.If you found this review helpful, please hit the ""Yes/Helpful"" button below to encourage me to write more.

",3.Jun.19,Yes,"Worst Sonos product ever. If you use Alexa you_l get skips incomplete sentences and nothing played until you get the _orry I'm having trouble right now, so you unplug it and it works for a day. Even using the sonos of app when it gets like this it doesn't work. Spent an hour with a very nice support person trying to fix it sending diagnostic after diagnostic and resting after resetting, but in the end they are just broken, no amount of button pushing or resetting fixes them.  Have  two beams, an amp, three earlier ones and a three,  each work flawlessly. These are crap. Until they fix the software stay away. Been a son is is fan for many years - if this was my introduction never would have spent another cent with them. I would return but trusted Sonos because of my long good history and threw away the boxes. :-(.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.",18
5,"SONOS ONE (GEN 2) continues the dominance of Sonos in streaming audio
  
",5.Jun.19,Yes,"I am a longtime user of Sonos products.  I had a full CONNECT system back in the days when there was a dedicated handheld controller, the only product color was white, and you supplied your own speakers.  I have also owned Play:1 and BEAM speakers.  I recently sold my BEAM soundbar in order to buy the two SONOS ONE (GEN2) speakers that I am reviewing today.I was using the BEAM as my TV sound and for music as well.  The BEAM was fine, especially for TV.  But I just missed the versatility and stereo separation of having two speakers.  The inclusion of Airplay 2 in the SONOS ONE speakers was the answer.  I now have the two SONOS ONE speakers set up as paired stereo and they connect via Airplay 2 to my Apple TV unit.The sound from the Apple TV is great and there appears to be no lag.  The sound syncs perfectly with the video displayed on my TV.  I play music from Apple Music, Spotify, and Pandora flawlessly using the SONOS app.  The Alexa functionality works well, although as one reviewer has mentioned you might want to use the Alexa app to set up your SONOS devices to use the ""Computer"" prompt if you have additional Alexa devices in the area.  I have had no connection or network issues.A few tips for setup:Do not plug all your new SONOS devices into power all at once.  Just plug in one and follow the setup on the SONOS app from there.If you are replacing a previous SONOS setup like I was, you may want to disable the SONOS skill in your Alexa app and then re-enable it once your speakers are fully setup.  Be sure to have your SONOS username/password handy.SONOS uses 2.4ghz networking for the speakers.  I have multiple networks on 2.4ghz and 5ghz frequencies and the SONOS setup process automatically found the 2.4.  Not sure but this might be why some users report connection difficulties despite their other devices working properly.  It shouldn't be a problem for most users.Airplay 2 functionality requires a few steps.  For instance, I went to Airplay in my Apple TV settings and enabled Airplay.  Then I added my Apple TV and the SONOS pair (seen as one device in the Home app) to the Home app.  Next I went to Video and Audio in my Apple TV settings and selected the speakers as my Audio Output.Be patient.  The setup can take a little time.  If you are impatient like me you may end up having to unplug a speaker to restart the setup process.  It's no big deal.Overall, I think SONOS has done it again.  I have tried other cheaper multiroom and streaming audio products.  You just can't beat a product that works this well with such great sound.  People are always impressed with the sound and the ability to play almost any song in seconds.  Being able to use these speakers for great TV sound instead of a dedicated soundbar (or even a BEAM) makes them my best home sound purchase.",4

",6.Jun.19,No,Sonos speakers can NOT be added to Amazon Multi-Room Music groups. I verified this with both Sonos and Amazon technical support.,1
1,"Connection issues destroy an otherwise good system
  
",7.Jun.19,No,"This worked fine for a while, but now when I ask Alexa to play any music or radio stations through the Sonos One, 2nd Edition, the response I get is, ""Hmmm. To do that first enable the skill on your Alexa app, and then discover devices."" Of course, the skill shows up as enabled already, but I go ahead and discover devices anyway, but it makes no difference. To make matters worse, adding this Sonos device to my system now means that NONE of my Alexa devices will play radio stations or music. They all tell me to enable the Sonos One skill, which, of course, is already enabled. Oddly, Alexa via Sonos will still tell me the weather, give me my flash briefing, etc., but it won't play music or radio stations. Go figure. I went to the Sonos' support page and tried the fixes available there, but they didn't work. The speaker does still work as part of my Sonos' system, so it's not a total waste, but I bought it for the Alexa integration, so it's almost a total waste.",2
3,"Great sound, incredibly unstable on WiFi
  
",21.Jun.19,No,"I have a small house (~1800 sq ft) with a decent mesh WiFi system (Google WiFi, 4 pucks). Nothing else falls off the network, and I can stream 4K video on the TV in my bedroom, which is farthest away from the main puck in the living room. Throughput within the house - from an Odroid XU4 that serves as a DLNA server to my Macbook Air is anywhere from 600-800 Mbps (megabits/sec), and my internet connection from Cox gives anywhere from 120-150 Mbps.I bought a Sonos One (2nd generation) 2-pack, so I could place a speaker in my bedroom and a speaker in the living room. On the pro-side, the sound quality is excellent; the speakers are easy to group. The Alexa integration is sufficient for my needs - because the speakers can be grouped, I like it that I can play the same music/radio shows on both speakers.What was remarkably bad is the WiFi stability. These things drop off the WiFi network at the drop off a hat. Within one day, I had to reset both speakers twice. Because I have Google WiFi, my solution was plug each speaker directly into a WiFi puck - this works well; they haven't dropped off yet. But its terrible that one has to use ethernet to get these things to work.I actually wonder if they would do better with a non-mesh WiFi system. In any event, for now, I'm satisfied with they way the work. But at nearly $200 apiece, surely Sonos could have got the WiFi working better.",1

",12.Jul.19,No,"I bought this because I wanted to upgrade the Amazon Echo device in my bedroom. I wanted better sound quality, and the sharp good looks wasn't bad either. I ended up liking it so much that I bought a second for stereo sound, then more of them for other rooms. The reliability increased a lot when I plugged a Sonos Booster directly into my router. When this is done, or when one of the speakers is connected, they form their own small network and don't have to compete with other devices on the main home wifi.

It was only somewhat more expensive than an Echo Plus 2nd Gen with allegedly better sound quality during Prime Day. HOWEVER... Alexa on Sonos One doesn't support alarms, meaning you can't say ""Alexa, wake me at 7:30 tomorrow morning to KCSM Jazz."" You can set alarms through the Sonos iApp, which is functional if inelegant, but that takes away the whole point of a voice-activated assistant.I confirmed the lack of alarm support through a number of sources, including Sonos support.My experience with the Sonos One is overall disappointing, and I'm contemplating sending it back. The sound quality is good, way better than the Echo Dot, but it's not ""OMG that's amazing"" good. It works with more services than the Echo, including AirPlay, at the cost of finding services and figuring out how to access them. However... the Echo just worked, with minimal fussing. The One is going to take figuring out, setting preferences, workarounds... feh.",1

The sound itself is amazing, no matter where you put it the sound is truly worth it. The only problem is the connectivity. It requires WiFi and requires the Sonos app to play.Adding bluetooth would make this an absolute winner in my opinion. I regularly have friends over that want to play music and when I tell them they need to install the Sonos app and connect to my WiFi to play their music it kind of quickly derails the fun we are having.I knew full well buying this that it didn't have bluetooth, but I didn't realize it would be such a problem. The Sonos app is also missing some flexibility. I like to open iTunes, find an artist, go to their songs (which lists every song from every album) and just play it. I can't seem to do that with the Sonos App.I think this is a must buy if you are extending an existing Sonos Network.

",25.Aug.19,Yes,"I received this smart speaker as a birthday gift from my wife. Since we were having a party, I wanted to get it set up to use it and put it through its paces.The setup was quick and easy. I downloaded the Sonos app on my iPhone, and followed the steps in the easy to follow instructions included. Initial setup took less than 10 minutes. However, it does take longer to customize the Sonos setup by connecting your music streaming services, enabling the smart features with either Google or Amazon, and tailoring the sound and other features to your liking.I very much like the quality and feel of this speaker. It is heavy and solid for it's compact size. And once I got the music playing, I was blown away. The sound quality of this speaker is simply amazing! Now I realize that sound quality is a very subjective thing, and that what sounds good to one may sound awful to someone else. However, this speaker is a pleasure to listen to. The treble is smooth and reproduces silky highs, and the bass is deep, resonant and powerful.I have the Sonos situated on the top of my computer desk right in the middle of the main room of our house and it very easily fills the whole space with rich sounding music while not even being near full volume. I had 30 guests over and the music was easily heard throughout the house.  In my opinion, the sound quality of the Sonos One is on the same level as the impressive Apple Homepod and is $100 cheaper to boot!The Amazon Alexa voice control on this speaker works just as well as my Amazon Echo Dot. I haven't noticed any decline in functionality.While I understand that $200 is on the expensive side, this is an amazing speaker and I definitely recommend it to anyone who is in the market for a smart speaker. I find myself listening to all of my music again just because it sounds so good with the Sonos One. I plan on getting another one for Christmas and placing it in the back of my house to enhance the sound stage even more.Update 10/23/19: Like other reviewers have said, I have experienced several connection issues and even had to remove the device and reinstall it as if it were new. Alexa voice commands lag slightly but worse have suddenly stopped working or work only intermittently. I will say ""Alexa, shuffle my rock playlist"" and she will respond ""OK, shuffling your rock playlist on Amazon music"" but no music plays. My connection is wireless but it is within 15 feet of my router so it isn't a distance issue.The connection and Alexa issues are frustrating because this is an excellent speaker.

",29.Aug.19,No,"It is very confusing: yes, it supports Google Assistant, but it is not a fully capable Google Assistant speaker.A true Google Assistant capable speaker allows you to control its volume and content via Google Home app. Sonos does not allow that. Technically speaking, it has Google Assistant but it doesn't have Chromecast capability. So, if you ask Sonos (by voice for example) to play your favorite radio station, it won't work, because you have to setup everything again in the Sonos app, even though everything is linked in the Google Home app.If this is the only speaker in your home, it might work. I already have all setup in the Google Home and I'm not willing to keep track of all settings in a separate app (Sonos app).",1

4,"Fantastic Speaker - But Not Perfect
  
",2.Oct.19,Yes,"About a year ago I purchased a Sonos Beam, Sonos Sub and 2 Sonos One speakers.  They sound absolutely amazing, I feel like I_ sitting in a movie theater.  I then purchased another 2 of these 2nd gen speakers to add to different rooms.The wireless connection concept of Sonos is both extremely convenient and yet slightly frustrating at the same time.I say that because when it works it_ so handy and so nice, but there have been times when I just can_ group my speakers together or one just won_ play.  Now let me say, this issue does NOT happen a lot.  Maybe once a month, so it_ not a huge deal breaker (which is why I still gave this 4 stars).Setup was super simple for me (I know other people seem like they_e having issues with initial connection).  I have a very fast Netgear gaming router so I suspect that is why I have so few issues with connection.  The app has definitely improved over the last 2 years so it helps walk you through adding it to a room and tuning the environment with your speakers.I_ not going to talk too much about speaker quality because I already shared my thoughts on it.  They sound amazing for home theater/entertainment speakers.  When using the Sonos Ones as ssurrounds, there_ just no beating it (when it comes to wireless options). I_ a sound engineer so I won_ say these are the best speakers I_e heard, but for the convenience factor of wireless, you just can_ get anything better.Build quality is outstanding.  Which for the price of Sonos speakers in general, I would expect nothing less.  Just nice to see they didn_ skimp out on quality.Most likely my biggest gripe with the Sonos One speaker is it_ built in microphones.  When using the built-in smart assistants (Alexa and Google Assistant) unless you_e right next to the speaker, you have to speak loudly to get it to hear you.  If there_ music playing, you might as well wake up the neighborhood because the volume in which you have to speak in to activate voice recognition will.Now don_ get me wrong, I can_ imagine going one day without my Sonos speakers, I love them.  I just wish they could fix these issues.  But unfortunately I don_ think the microphone sensitivity is something they could improve with a software update, so I_ have to upgrade all of my speakers.  All that being said, if you don_ plan to rely heavily upon the smart assistants then this is a non-issue.Before buying Sonos speakers, I had a HomePod (I loved it).  But they_e very expensive and I wanted a multi room speaker setup.  If you_e looking to fill your house with smart speakers, get Sonos.  If you_e going with a single speaker setup (and you have exclusively apple devices) go with the HomePod.  Now the Sonos One gen 2 speakers work with Airplay 2 which is a huge game changer for those who are stuck in the Apple ecosystem.  Because now you can airplay to these from any Apple device, rather than having to go through the Sonos app to play music.  You can also group them up together and stream music to many different rooms which is so nice.When it comes to the Sonos One vs. HomePod, the HomePod sounds better.  However when you pair two Sonos Ones together, they sound better.So it really just depends on which eco system you are in.  If you don_ use Apple Music, go with Sonos. Definitely have and would recommend building a Sonos system to anyone who doesn_ want to worry about wiring up speakers and connecting amps.  The wireless protocol is just too convenient to pass up.The Sonos One gen 2 makes for a perfect addition to your home and they work as great surround speakers if you ever get the full home theater setup!",8

I am going to just disable it and put my dot back in use, because its too frustrating and undependable.Also while researching the problem, I saw the manufacturer support deflecting and appearing to blame owners WiFi, and other network issues for their devices Alex problems, which has me wondering if they have any intention of ever correcting it.Bottom line, great speaker, bad Alexa implementation.",0

",20.Oct.19,No,"Sounds great when it worked. Plagued by connection issues like most other reviewers. It seems like we can never get this speaker playing properly without 5-15min of troubleshooting. Such a waste of time owning Sonos devices - they should be paying me as a tester at this point.UPDATE: I can't tell you how many hours I spent troubleshooting this before stumbling upon some random comment deep in some forum thread. The trick to getting your Sonos network to work consistently is leaving one unit plugged in via Ethernet. Apparently when no units are left hardwired, the Sonos is forced to use your WiFi network instead of it's own Proprietary Mesh Network. If you leave one Sonos hardwired (I believe any unit), your Sonos network will start using it's own network and magically work as advertised.I have to leave this at 3-stars though, since it took me a good 8-10 hours before I figured this out.",0

",8.Nov.19,No,"Everything about my Sonos speakers experience was frustrating. The smart tuning thing never worked, they disconnected from Alexa regularly, setting up multiple speakers in a group is confusing. Here_ what they don_ tell you: YOU CAN_ DO EVERYTHING ALEXA DOES WITH THE SPEAKERS! Sonos speakers will NOT replace a regular Alexa device. And though they try very hard to make setup easy, god forbid you need to go in and change anything. Plain and simple: it_ complicated. I found myself messing with the apps ( Sonos, Alexa and Spotify in some combination depending on the problem) and still couldn_ get it to work consistently.  My wife who is not tech savvy gave up trying to listen to her music at all because it was just not reliable.And even disconnecting them from Alexa is a pain. They still aren_ completely disconnected even though they are unplugged. Alexa wants to look for them and I can_ figure out how to get rid of that.The whole Sonos experience was a disappointing nightmare from the day I bought them.

Given Sonos reputation I am really disappointed, and maybe it was rushed initially but I've had it for quite awhile and so far no amount of updates have made the errors stop.",0
1,"DO NOT BUY
  
",10.Nov.19,No,DO NOT BUY unless you are committed to spending money on a monthly music subscription service for the rest of your life. For some reason Sonos has decided it is not enough to spend hundreds or thousand of dollars on speakers to outfit your home. Now you can no longer play music that you have purchased from your phone. They have sold out to the subscription music services so now in order to play music on your very expensive speakers you also have to subscribe to a monthly music service!!,3

",6.Dec.19,No,"I purchased two of these before thanksgiving weekend. Then when they went on sale for $150, I tried to buy some more. I was able to add them to my cart, but kept getting an error while finalizing the purchase.  Very frustrating as now the price is more. - This is on amazon.Setup was fairly easy (I've set these up many times for others and never had any issues), however I was unable to login into my existing sonos account at first and tried a password reset. The password reset email came and it asked me to sign in. LOL, thanks sonos.  I had to write tech support via their submit request page. They then replied with ""what's your email address""  WELL, the same one that I you required me to type into the email field and the same on that I clearly wrote in the body of of the support request. Took about a day to actually get back into my account. Not too bad, but sad for a simple password reset.Disappointed that the sonos device / account setup requires so much personal information. These are SPEAKERS and sonos should not force users to even register them.  I don't have to do that with any Bluetooth speaker, computer, laptop, etc. . I don't care that they don't or won't sell the data.  Data gets hacked from companies all the time. Do we need a reminder: Home Depot, Target, Equifax, Yahoo, Marriott, Chase Bank, eBay.  How is sonos protecting our data?  Do they treat it like target treated their data, or do they treat it like target should have treated their data. - Not sure if their data protection is documented / disclosed but if not, it would be nice to hear.  Seems like far to often we hear about large companies (after their big data breaches) that they failed to protect customer data in a big glaring way that even surprises me, and I'm not a data security expert in any way.As for the productPros:Looks NiceDecent SoundMusic keeps playing after you leave the room / house (whereas Bluetooth would disconnect).Cons:iPhone Music App:  Paying music from the iPhone music app was disabled about 6 month ago.  This is a no brainier feature.  Half the phones out there are iPhones.  Many people have music on their phones in the ""Music"" app.  This was a working feature for years. Unfortunately it was removed and i didn't know until after i spent the money.Alexa Voice Assistant:  Alexa simply will not stay connected. It works for the day it's setup, then when I try it again it says ""sorry, I'm having trouble understanding right now, please try a little later"".  I go through the whole disconnect and setup instructions and it works but just for a day or so.  Because these speakers can play music from multiples sources, being able to always tap pause on your phone isn't an option. And when receiving a phone call, music keeps playing (which can be nice), but if you want to pause it before a phone call Alexa is nice and can do that in split second WHEN ALEXA WORKS. But since Alexa keeps disconnecting, then it makes it impossible to use.  I never had this issue with any other Alexa devices.  A simple Bluetooth speaker works better as it will always pause when on the phone.Line In: These devices don't have a line in jack. They should. The Play5 has a line in and allows for playing and grouping speakers.Forced Software / Firmware Updates: I have set up many sonos systems over the years for others and am frustrated at the forced updates that these require when opening the app. Sometimes they break the system and you have to set them up again.  If the speakers worked yesterday without the update, then they should work today without the update.  I'm certainly not against updates to products, but Sonos needs to stop forcing them on us when we open the app.PLEX PLEX PLEX:Plex is amazing and it's accessible via sonos but you can't sort / filter by genre. This is so frustrating as I would like to simply play my Christmas music on random but that's not possible.  I tried making a playlist which was super slow to load on the sonos app, then once it was visible, it was just a simple list of a few thousand songs. This does allow for random and play all, but if I setup a ""Alternative Rock"" playlist then once again it's just a huge LONG list of songs, no way to easily get to an artist or album. So there really is no practical way to filter by genre. It's either by Artist, Album, or Song. There is a shuffle all that would allow for Christmas music in july or audio book chapters at random - Thanks Plex and Sonos (not sure who is at fault but this needs to be fixed).Apple iTunesSetting up home sharing made me realize that sonos has limits to the number of songs it can see. - 65,000.  I have a little over 65,000 (All .MP3's) but there were far less than 65,000 that imported.  Home sharing was also very slow at loading within the sonos app.  Took several minutes, crashed the app several times (iPhone X). Not at all acceptable.I have been wanting to buy these for myself for a few years now. Unfortunately I plan on returning these.  Looks like the Apple Home Pod Speakers will resolve this. Sad, but at least i'll be able to actually control and play the music I want to listen to. After all, these are speakers.",0

",2.Jan.20,Yes,"I have several of these speakers all over the house now, and it's so nice to be able to control them from my phone, a tablet, or my computer. Enables everyone to play their own music from one music account.",0
1,"Waste of time and money.
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,Worked on product for three days. Couldn_ get it to hook up with any home device. I finally gave up and returned. Doesn_ Bluetooth must download app and WiFi to use. Not worth money.,0
3,"Great sound but Alexa is limited
  
",3.Jan.20,Yes,"I bought this to replace an Echo Dot. I have been using the wake work ""Echo"" throughout my house for over a year now and have created customized audio responses to certain routines. Unfortunately this device only allows the use of ""Alexa"" as the wake word and does not support the use of customized audio responses and generates a long error message for any routine that uses them. After doing some digging it seems there are a number of other features it is also lacking. I was hoping to get two more of these but have decided to hold off. Hopefully a software update will fix this someday.",0
5,"Awesome purchase
  
",4.Jan.20,Yes,"Was looking for this speaker, held out for Cyber Monday when I found it at Amazon at the lowest price anywhere. This speaker was used to stereo-pair another Sonos One and I couldn't be happier sounds awesome, has all the Sonos playback features of course plus the Alexa and Google compatibility and again, found this atAmazon for the lowest price anywhere, what else can I say..",0
5,"Airplay and exceptional sound from a small device
  
",5.Jan.20,Yes,"Love this speaker. If you_e an iphone user and are looking for an AirPlay speaker and also like the convenience of Alexa, this is ur speaker. The sounds is deep and rich and sounds equally great Loud or quiet.",0
5,"Small size, BIG sound!
  
",5.Jan.20,Yes,"Truly a great speaker.  I love the compact size with the room filling sound.  I have the speaker in a 16 x 16 room just awesome sounded.  Great low range, wonderful highs, and beautiful mid range.  Better sounding than the Play One_.",0
5,"Amazing sound anywhere you want with ease,
  
",8.Jan.20,Yes,"Amazing sound, software app is so well done so nice to have quality sound in every room of the home the app the system inter grates together with alexia looking forward to getting the outdoor equipment for the pool and patios,",0
4,"The sound is amazing.
  
",8.Jan.20,No,"I love this little machine, it has officially replaced my whole home sound system.The sound quality is crisp and clear, the volume level is loud enough to hear everywhere without distortion.My only compliant is that I cannot figure out how to connect the smart assistance function. Online it looks so simple but I cannot see the same options that others see. I don_ blame the Sonos, I_ told it_ something to do with region locking because I have this device outside of the USA. Hopefully this I can solve soon.I would recommend this to anyone looking for high quality music.",0
1,"Connection is horrible
  
",8.Jan.20,Yes,"The sound is awesome when it decides to work. I never write reviews but felt the need to try to steer any one away from buying these speakers. It connects to your actual WiFi, NOT Bluetooth. For whatever reason that makes connecting these speakers extremely difficult. It never wants to work. Ever. Then if it does, it_ connected for a couple of minutes and then disconnects. There is nothing wrong with my WiFi. I run numerous things on my WiFi and everything connects fine. The connection to Sonos is an absolute nightmare. Do not buy these! Buy something else!",0
