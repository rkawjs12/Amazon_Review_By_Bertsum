5,"Best Blind TV Experience Ever!!
  
",29.Jun.18,Yes,"This was a wonderful investment. Best tv experience I_e had being blind. There_ so much in doing for yourself.I did complete setup without assistance. Voice View narrated every step. Even tells you screen off when powering off.Gone are the days of how many presses for input. A heads up for my blind brothers and sisters... the top HDMI port is HDMI 1. This is also the HDMI ARC for your audio receiver, sound bar.The only difficulty for blind is attaching the stand. A left and right which I guarantee you_l never figure out. Neighbor attached stand and checked to make sure no damage, or dead pixels.Thank you Amazon, Best Buy, and Toshiba. Best accessible tv I_e encountered for blind consumers.Initial voice view is activated by pressing Back and Menu for 2 seconds. The left and right button above the ring. Remote is slightly different from Fire TV. There is a voice view tutorial for the remote.Also you can change inputs with voice. Just say input 1, or HDMI 1. Great speakers and value for this price point.PS: connecting to Echo Dot was a breeze. Link in Alexa app. I can change volume and inputs with Dot. Along with power on/off.Update:Another benefit found for blind customers. Software updates on TV_, Apple TV, etc. can be difficult. Without audible cues it can be hard to tell when done. When software reboots it lets you know disconnect from input. When a device restarts, device reconnects to input with voice cue.It took awhile to figure out, but changing input name is possible. Go to inputs under settings tab, highlight the input name you want to change, don't select... Instead press menu twice. An options menu will pop up. Their are like 14 options to name the input.By going to tv.toshiba@toshiba.com you_l find a full users manual. Model LF621U. I recommend for hidden and not obvious features.",378

",6.Aug.18,Yes,"This is the smartest TV I've ever seen.The picture quality is amazing.Easy to set up and easy to use.Streaming is so easy I am cutting back on my cable TV bill because everything streams so clean and the interface is easier than my cable TV interface.Having two complete web browsers to choose from are amazing, haven't found anything I can't do online yet.Also being able to control all of my Alexa devices and having complete Alexa functionality with my TV Remote in my bedroom is great too.",1
1,"Very disappointed with continued sound and audio sync
  
",11.Aug.18,Yes,"Was a great purchase at first. Got it for my wife as she is recovering from surgery. Now we tune into a show, everything works fine, and then it pauses and the audio lags 4 seconds. With my work hours, cannot easily call their standard tech support hours. Very disappointedUpdate: Spent several hours trying to get customer service help and finally had to do a hard reset and reinstall all software including all the passwords (remembering all those UGH). The sync issue keeps popping up over and over again. I used to manage a tech department so it's not like I dont understand minor issues. Either it's a bad product, bad updates, and/or bad tech service that cannot help to resolve the continued problem.Update 2: The TV continues to loose sync with the sound. It's hit or miss on the shows. We have even gone to another TV in the house just to check and it has no problems. We just dont have time to keep wasting to help them troubleshoot.",5

",23.Aug.18,Yes,"Don't know what is the problem. I turn off TV and blue light does not light up in corner of TV when it is off. It is like the TV is still getting power to it although TV is off.

3,"The picture is good, but they removed display casting. Get an older model if you want that feature.
  
",26.Aug.18,Yes,"This has a good screen and I can do almost everything I wanted from it. Unfortunately, that almost is a pretty big deal for me. They removed screen mirroring from the latest versions, so you can no longer cast your web browser to your TV. If you get this TV, and find that you want to do that, you're going to end up with a Chromecast or Roku anyway.",1

",26.Aug.18,Yes,"Works great. I just wish it had a sleep timer. I also find the ""shortcut"" buttons on the remote annoying/pointless (prime video, Netflix, HBO and Vue).

",28.Aug.18,Yes,I finally caved and bought a larger TV for my husband. I bought the fire edition for me. I'm glad I did. Such a great clear picture and easy to navigate to all my favorite apps!,1
4,"Great tv! The Remote was a little buggy but amazon helped me fix it!
  
",28.Aug.18,Yes,"I really like the tv, it has great video quality and decent sound- plus I love the fire tv is built in. I did have an issue with some of the buttons on the remote-The home and microphone button wouldn_ respond at all. I_e only had the tv a month and the remote hasn_ been dropped or anything. Turns out it was a glitch in the system, but amazon called me and helped me fix it! It was super easy. I just had to deregister the device and then re login and problem solved!",1
3,"It's ok...
  
",28.Aug.18,Yes,"So every once in awhile, the picture will go out but you turn it off and turn it on again and it's fine.  Also, makes a noise like it's going to blow up.  These don't happen often but enough to think the TV isn't going to last long.  Well today, after turning the TV off, a few seconds later, it turns back on again.  It would not stay off.  I went through all the settings to see if there was something, but couldn't find anything.  I finally had to unplug it.",2
5,"Best bet for the money.

5,"Perfect, all-inclusive smart TV functionality.
  
",1.Sep.18,Yes,"I love this TV. Though the search function in the app store is bad and counter-intuitive, I can't adequately describe how nice it is to have a single remote for all tv functions. As a cord cutter, all our tv consumption is via apps so this is really nice.

4,"Nice picture
  
",3.Sep.18,Yes,It's a beautiful picture and really bright. I would recommend as a gaming or living room t.v. The only downfall for us is the internet cable service we use is only available on Roku and we had to purchase another one instead of just being able to download the app.,0
4,"Great TV Not Suitable For A PC Monitor or Gaming
  
",3.Sep.18,Yes,"The online services for this monitor are awesome.  Unfortunately for me I bought this as a monitor for my TV.  The published refresh rate for this 4k tv is 60hz which should be fine for a PC monitor.  Unfortunately at 4k this TV only can operate at 24mz.  Anything under 60hz (and even 60hz a bit when playing games) will cause serious lag between mouse movements and the display movement with motion blur.  I had to go all the way down to 1080p 1920 x 1080 to get the published 60hz.  Switching to a ""Premium HDMI cable should allow the TV to get to it's 4K resolution however.Input lag is how long it takes for a display to update after it receives a signal. In Movie mode, the Toshiba Fire TV Edition shows a poor 70.6ms input lag. Switching to Game mode cuts that down to a much more reasonable 40.2ms, but that's still far too high to consider it to be a good TV for gaming",21
5,"A complete entertainment package inside a 43"" screen.
  
",3.Sep.18,Yes,"What I like about the Fire Stick section is, it is a lot like Roku but this TV gives me a lot more options than Roku. I like the ability to add apps and browsers. The TV arrived sooner than expected, 3 days, even though I expected a week's time for shipping. Pleasantly surprised.",0

5,"Great TV
  
",8.Sep.18,Yes,"We needed a new TV and the deal on this on Prime Day was great. Higher end TVs may have a little better quality picture, but this is very good and, hey, it_ TV. I did link it with my Echo Dot. Alexa likes specific language to control the TV but once you get that down it_ pretty cool to instruct her to _urn on fire tv _pen Netflix ......  We_e decided to _ut the cord with cable TV and this makes it easy to navigate through the various options available without cable. I_e also connected an antenna to this. With the antenna I receive live broadcast from the major networks (CBS, ABC, NBC) as well as many other channels. I receive at least 55 channels with the antenna. Hook up was easy.",1

",10.Sep.18,Yes,I_ too lazy to lift a finger. Almost too lazy to speak. I_ rather not a lift a finger so I chose this tv so I can continue my lazy ways of not lifting a finger and Can now yell at Alexa instead of my kids to turn the channel. My kids like the new me. Thanks.,1

",10.Sep.18,Yes,"its ok for the price for sure, black levels kinda bother me.  remote is a bit annoying to use sometimes.  doesnt exceed 60hz in 4k, but how could it for this price? pretty sweet otherwise.  I retired a three panel 1080p setup with this tv, and it works pretty well.",3

",15.Sep.18,Yes,"It_ been a couple of weeks with my Toshiba Amazon Tv and I don_ miss having cable tv! Bought this awesome tv during Amazon Prime Day and it_ practically paid for itself. Not only does it have all my go to tv apps but now that Apple and Amazon have settled their feud, I can see all my movies I purchased on my Apple TV. Prior to my Amazon Fire Tv I had to use one remote for my cable box and another for the Apple TV, having the preset buttons on the Amazon remote is cool but my favorite feature is the build in Alexa. For the price point, it was definitely a good deal.",0

5,"LOVE this TV
  
",24.Sep.18,Yes,"It's stupid easy to use, the interface is slick and quick. We don't use the voice feature much, sometimes it (Alexa voice) snags (hey it's Amazon not Google) and doesn't work but only a few times. Put the VidAngel app on my TV, now I can EASILY watch Netflix (which is almost 100% rated R shows these days) without worry. And I downloaded a bunch of other apps I'll probably never use. How cool!We don't like.... the glowing light on the front when the TV's off. It's in our bedroom, and the glowing LED is like the eye of Mordor at night. I mean really, what's up with everything these days that has the slightest bit of power flowing through it have the brightest daggum LED glowing, this TV was the worst though! Electrical tape fixed that though.We do like.... lots of inputs, but with having Prime Video, VidAngel, Netflix, etc all built in through the remote I mean we cut out some inputs we used to need. Just have the Chromecast plugged in to it and a blu-ray player which we really never use anymore. Oh, yeah, and a DirecTV receiver. I forgot we still had that... I like being able to rename the inputs though and use the remote to say ""Switch to satellite."" However, Chromecast was not an option to use. Good grief Amazon get over it already! Also, the interface like I said is really fast. I was worried there would be lag. Although it's sorta bad because everyone in the house from the two year old up, even the dogs, know how to tune in to whatever they want to watch.The speakers sound really decent, better than expected, I mean you still need a Klipsch sound system but until you can afford one after buying the TV the built in speakers are fine, especially in a smaller room. I like all the apps although I think I'll only use just a few. But it's nice to know there is expand-ability there.Overall, probably not a bad idea to replace the living room TV with one of these eventually...",16
3,"43"" Toshiba
  
",26.Sep.18,Yes,"The major problem I have with this TV is that you can cast movie previews to it, but not movies from Hulu or Vudoo.The picture is OK with some pixelation wit action.  Some 4K content seems too busy,  so sometimes better isn't.There are some video and audio features that are not too good, so it's  better to leave some of them disabled.Amazon interface, just is not as good as the roku interface.I have recently connected an HD antenna, and it seems to treat antenna channelsand some Pluto channels as part of the same channel lineup on the same guide.I don't know if they would merge in SlingTV, Direct TV, HULU TV, or  YouTubeTV in the same way?No spectrum cable app.",1
5,"Great picture
  
",27.Sep.18,Yes,I swear this tv is better than our Samsung was! The colors are much more vibrant even though they say they are both 4k. And the amazon platform is much easier to use than some of he other interfaces on smart TVs,0
1,"Defectice TV. Do not buy
  
",27.Sep.18,Yes,The TV is defective. Screen goes blank and only audio plays. Won't refund me,2
4,"Everything I was looking for in a TV at almost half the cost
  
",30.Sep.18,Yes,"Because it is a Fire TV the integration with Alexa is outstanding. No more fumbling through menus to change inputs. Just name your HDMI port and say, ""Alexa Input Cable"", she figures it out from there and switches the TV's input to HDMI port named ""Cable""!  The TV can also be set to default to the last HDMI port used, rather than the Fire streaming menu; this way it works like a normal TV until you want to use the Fire functions (then on the remote or Alexa just say ""Go Home"" to go to the Fire TV home screen, or press the home button on the remote). TV On / Off, volume up/down, start Hulu, play Prime music? Yep, you can do it all with Alexa or the remote.The picture and sound are great. Saved us money on a sound bar and no extra remote needed!We can't say enough good things about our TV.  The price is also great. We couldn't wait for shipping so we purchased ours directly from Best Buy. First time I've been in a store (other than a grocery or gift store) in three years! Normally I buy everything online.One month update:  Still love the TV. I've knocked a point off because the sound level can change dramatically between power offs. One time you turn it on and a  level 20 is a comfortable level. Turn it off, turn it on later, and 20 is WAY too loud, have to turn it down to 5 to get the same level of volume!This can probably be fixed with a firmware update, so I'm waiting. I would really love to see more frequent updates. There are a few minor improvements they could (and probably will) make. Many are probably waiting for an Amazon update rather than Toshiba), such as better Alexa integration (try to get Amazon Prime music to play through Alexa is next to impossible. Amazon video works pretty well). It would also be nice if Alexa and the TV would communicate, so when you say ""Alexa"" it would mute the TV sound while you're talking. Otherwise the TV simply drowns out your commands (its hard enough to wake up Alexa when the TV volume is turned up).I would still give this TV a 5 star rating if they fix that annoying volume problem. It's fun watching my wife jump, but I'm starting to feel sorry for her!",15

",8.Oct.18,Yes,"Not very happy with ours so far. Bought it on Prime Day and within two months we were already having problems with the display. As others have commented, when we first turn it on the screen will cut out and go black, while we can still hear the audio. When the picture comes back it continuously flickers for about another five minutes before it finally comes in. Amazon didn't care to hear about it, as it is a hardware problem according to them. So instead of just switching it out for a new one, they made us call Toshiba, who in turn is sending out a Best Buy tech. We have done all the things that need to be done. Unplugged it, changed the HDMI cable and checked all the connections. It's obviously a faulty display since it does it every time we turn the TV on and regardless of the input. HDMI, OTA, WiFi, etc. Usually very happy with Amazon customer service, but not this time.",13
5,"Great Value
  
",10.Oct.18,Yes,"I bought this from Best Buy directly on a whim. Like most negative reviews, I initially had an issue with Netflix not streaming at 4k, despite Amazon streaming it fine. After some momentary frustration, I called Netflix directly and they told me to replace my Cat5 Ethernet with a Cat6 cable. I did it and Netflix began streaming in glorious 4k ...all at a value price. This is a steal in my opinion.",0

",14.Oct.18,Yes,Never buy a TV with built in fire TV. All TV setting are managed by fire TV OS which has very few settings.  It never goes to cable box as default when turning on even though I set it as default. You turn on your cable TV and the fire TV home screen comes up so you always have to select an input.  Better to buy a TV and fire TV separate. The TV itself is pretty good.,3

",30.Oct.18,Yes,"Hope you don't like Netflix, because it doesn't work on this TV. After every troubleshooting option (including fully factory resetting the TV), Netflix will happily load, let me pick a show, then immediately show this error instead of streaming anything: ""tvq-pm-100 (5.2.5)""It's not the network, literally every other streaming services works fine, but I purchased this primarily for Netflix use, and for that it is utterly useless.",18

",8.Nov.18,Yes,"I bought this TV in July and I am very happy with it.  The initial set up was a little challenging as it was different from all my other TV's but I had it up and running within one hour.  The picture quality is perfection and the sound quality is rich, full and a pleasure to listen to.  There's no tinny sound when the volume is turned up for music.  I love that I only need one remote to go from antenna TV to streaming.  When I want to hear music I just push the button and say play music.  It is completely in tune with the music I like or if I want to watch a streaming show I don't have to go to the streaming company and find the show I just tell Alexa what show I want to watch and it picks up from where I left off.  It when you press down on the remote when watching antenna tv it shows all the shows that are on the various channels.  You have your own tv guide. The only thing that worries me is the remote is one of a kind and I'm terrified of breaking it.  I have looked and I do not see anywhere to buy a replacement remote.  The TV is a great buy and I'm very happy with it.",10

",18.Nov.18,Yes,Awesome TV.. bought this on Prime day and didn't regret it. I have Samsung and Sony TV's throughout my house and this TV blows them away. Picture quality is great but the sound is impressive and my favorite part.,0
4,"Good to, especially for the price.
  
",19.Nov.18,Yes,"I purchased this in July during Prime Day. I was hesitant purchasing a Toshiba instead of one of the fancy Samsung, Vizio, etc TV's.  However, I'm very happy with my purchase (wish I would have sprung for the 55"" inch though). The sound is great!  Swear I hardly turn it above 10 and it's LOUD!  The picture isn't amazing (this is where you can see the difference between the $1k TV's and this), but for the price I'm not complaining.  My blue ray/DVD player hooked up without a problem (it is not 4k ultra).  I just had to adjust some settings to get the picture and sound to come in, which the TV actually did for me at the push of a button.  I rarely use the Alexa features (just like I rarely use my echo and echo dot).  All around I'm happy with my purchase.  I wanted a big TV (50"") but I didn't want to pay the huge price tag.  I haven't experienced any of the issues that other people have reported (knock on wood).",0
1,"Probably the most disappointing electronics purchase that I have made.
  
",21.Nov.18,Yes,"I bought this on prime day. Perfect size. Perfect price. Perfect amenities. Work great for about five months. Then all of a sudden, nothing. Nothing at all. If you unplug it and plug it back you get kind of welcome screen, Then it freezes and you get a blank screen. Over and over again. Look for a return. Best Buy will not standby this product. They lost my business. Customer service was pretty lame on this. I should_e bought the extended electronics warranty, but I did not think something like this could go this wrong this fast. Not buying any more electronics from Amazon or Best Buy.",12

4,"Remote issues
  
",25.Nov.18,Yes,Good quality picture sound is ok. The remote is to small for my hands and the round back means that you can_ use it on a flat surface. The remote also seams to be able to control my sound bar. When I fast forward or rewind the volume increases and decreases. The sound bar remote has the same control problem on the tv. I_ not able to find any information online to correct this issue.,1
4,"Great deal from Prime Day, but not worth full price
  
",26.Nov.18,Yes,"I bought this during the Prime Day deal and I have used it extensively.Pros:- Navigation is very easy and fluid using the provided remote and the voice features work well too. I don't have any Alexa devices to pair with it but I'm sure they work well.- 4k and HDR look good. (But not great)- Built in speakers are better than expected.- Setup was a breeze using an Amazon account.- I have had a reliable wifi connection, but it's now hardwired using Ethernet.Cons- Has a lot of motion blur since it is only 60 Hz.- Non HDR shows are fairly dark, doesn't seem to be an issue with HDR shows though. I use this TV in my room with the windows closed and it is fine for that.- Few HDMI ports, but not much if an issue since it has so many smart features built in.Overall verdict: Great TV for the prime day price, but not worth full price. There are a lot of ads but it doesn't bother me since I got it for such a good deal. I would buy again if it went for sale under $300.",18
4,"Not a new TV, it is ""recertified"".
  
",26.Nov.18,Yes,"It's a very nice TV, but it is ""Recertified"" or in english a refurbushed TV. Nowhere on the description does it state ""recertified"".",0

",29.Nov.18,Yes,Not sure how good the tv is but I literally just took it out of the box and set it down and tried using it .... the remove can only turn off/on the tv so im sat here looking at the continue screen pressing the select button that doesn't work. Yay...,2
1,"Good while it lasts...
  
",29.Nov.18,Yes,This tv worked great for several months. Rarely had any problems. Sometimes it would freeze up and I had to unplug it. But the other day the remote stopped working and I figured I could call and order a new one. Nope! Not only will they not send a replacement. They do not cover this model at all. So in their polite customer service way they basically told my I'm screwed and I've wasted $300 on a TV that doesn't work. Got a universal remote which helps but only navigates through half the apps. So if you search anything be ready to turn it off if you wanna go back. Gonna switch back to my Walmart tv cuz at least that one is functioning.,2

I contacted Amazon customer service and they said that I needed to cancel my order (wait a week to be refunded) and then order the TV again. They offered no other resolution, which was disappointing.But as for the TV itself. It's easy to use. Works with me Echo Dot and was overall a pretty good price.",1

5,"Product Review
  
",5.Dec.18,Yes,"Its exactly what it says it is. Its been 1 day, but the picture works, the fire TV process is the best. We set it up in my daughters room, and cant talk on the remote a good 45 feet away in our room while she's falling asleep. Its a great little tv. We bought the full warranty so if anything does happen, oh well that's what warranties are for.",0
1,"why buy a fire tv if it alexa can't control it?
  
",6.Dec.18,Yes,"The one reason I purchased this tv instead of a bigger and nicer one was to use my alexa echo to turn it on/off/pause. It does that once. Then it doesn't do it again unless i unlink and link the tv back up. I spent two days with amazon tech support and wasted hours trying to fix it while being transferred over 5 times between departments placing the blame on each other and giving me no solutions. What a waste of money, I should have just bought the regular 4k tv without alexa capabilities, it would have done the same thing while being prettier.",0
2,"Cheap! Does not last and the power save functionality is infuriating!!!
  
",8.Dec.18,Yes,"*UPDATE 12/07/2019*This TV SUCKS! We've barely had it over a year now and it freezes up constantly, requiring a reboot! And as I alluded to in my previous review, the power save feature was designed by morons! There is no way to control this feature, so the TV shuts off by itself, CONSTANTLY!If you ever need to pause your movie/show/program to go to the bathroom, grab something in the kitchen, or talk to someone on the phone, you'd better do it fast! If you're not fast enough, be prepared to come back to a TV that has shut itself off, requiring you to spend a few minutes having to once again find what you were watching previously and restart the program. It's a giant PAIN IN THE A$$!As the old adage goes, ""You get what you pay for""!Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere, you'll be happy you did!---We've had this TV for a few months now and so far we love it! This TV is an enormous ""bang for the buck""!IMHO, this TV's picture rivals that of far more expensive TVs I've owned. Quite frankly, I can't believe the picture quality you get at this price level. The TV is relatively bright with good contrast and colors and the black-levels are inky deep which is a must for me when it comes to a TV. I cannot stand a TV where the blacks look more dark-gray than black.The sound quality is not a strength of this TV and if you intend on purchasing this TV, I'd advise you use a soundbar or speakers with it, otherwise, you may constantly struggle with sound clarity. More specifically, you'll often be questioning what an actor/actress just said during scenes with dialogue.The Amazon Home screen could use some work as it can appear cluttered at times -- there is a lot going on - however, once you get used to it, it's tolerable. Also, this can become a fairly moot point if you choose to use Alexa commands the majority of the time as you won't need to navigate the cluttered and sometimes confusing menu.My biggest complaint about this TV is the extremely infuriating lack of a setting or control for the power save functionality, which is a tremendous oversight by the developers if you ask me! Seriously guys/gals, unless I'm missing something, there appears to be no way to control the amount of time during which this TV will power down and go into either sleep or off mode, whichever it is. So, when you need to go to the bathroom or decide to slip into the kitchen to grab a bite, be prepared to come back to a TV that has turned itself off! This becomes extremely annoying as you will have to turn the TV back on and once again find what it is that you were watching from whatever app you were watching it from. Honestly, how is it none of the developers noticed this would be an issue?! Obviously, they could benefit from a lesson in UX design!Other than this tremendous oversite, the TV is well worth the price of admission, even more so if you get it during one of Amazon's many sales!Fingers crossed that the developers add a setting to control the power save feature in the near future!",15
3,"Don't buy a Fire TV if you have You Tube TV
  
",8.Dec.18,Yes,"Bought this TV for my daughter's bed room.  We got it set up, but were shocked to discover that she cannot download the YouTube TV app because Amazon and Google are in a spat.

",9.Dec.18,Yes,"I have to restart the device each time I have had it paused for more than a few seconds or it will not load and run certain apps (CBS and NetFlix, for example.)It also does not play well with my Polk home theater speakers - sometimes goes silent, sometimes jumps the volume, often runs video lagging behind the audio feed.It was a great price, and the picture is nice, but there are a lot of steps involved in firing it up each day.",1

5,"Brilliant picture, with sound!
  
",14.Dec.18,Yes,"After seeing criticisms of the 60 Hz refresh rate, I was concerned, not that I knew what it was about, technically. Apparently 60 hz refresh rates have been common in televisions. It works perfectly for this 50"" television, possibly enhanced with software. Watching fast action on Netflix and Prime, there's no ghosting at all. The picture is brilliant.I was delighted to find this television has good sound, with no distortion at plenty of volume.  Volume was sorely missing from my last television that I bought a couple of years ago.In short this inexpensive TV (financed at zero interest at BB for $299!) is a streamer's dream. Alexa and everything else is all here in one place, with no tangle of remotes, devices and wires. The experience is simply better for the viewer - namely me. Broadcast channels are excellent - and presented like cable. That was a real surprise and delight feature. A great leap forward, to borrow a phrase from where most TVs are being made.I did not go any bigger due to space limitations. The stable pedestal is centralized and not too wide. This much larger flat screen fit the stand that I bought years ago. Also, it's not heavy. The box and packaging are half the weight. Could not be better so far.",0

5,"Excelente Smart TV 100% recomendada
  
",15.Dec.18,Yes,La mejor inversión que he hecho en mucho tiempo por cálidad - precio! A+,5
4,"The Apps suck
  
",15.Dec.18,Yes,"So, I got this TV crazy cheap during Black Friday (under $200) so my expectations may be different from others but for the price I paid, the TV is decent. The screen looks nice (maybe my standards are low, its my first 4k), the audio is loud and clear (I put it at 50 out of 100 so I can hear it from 25 ft away while cooking and generally have the volume under 20, to give you an idea of how loud it is).And yeah, its an Amazon TV so you're getting Amazon promo stuff. I never notice it, I just instinctively scroll down to what I'm actually looking for. My main problem with this TV is that the apps for it are terrible. I'm a news junkie and CNN takes forever to load, MSNBC (actually just NBC, there isn't a separate MSNBC app) rarely if ever loads, in fact, only Fox News works properly. Plex is also a risky proposition with this TV, sometimes it works great, sometimes it doesn't work at all. I suspect it has something to do with the TV telling the server it can handle a format that it actually can't and so the server isn't transcoding it properly, but I haven't actually figured out the exact problem, so I'm just making an educated guess. I've found myself having to go into the settings to manually reset the TV several times trying to interact with those apps. Ultimately I found myself sideloading my Verizon FIOS app to watch TV, and yeah I had to sideload it because Amazon doesn't have a Verizon app of its own. Which caused its own problem because the app needs a mouse to work (not a big deal for me, I had a spare wireless mouse, but just be advised).But, now that I have that all sorted out, I have a relatively lovely TV that I am pretty happy with (especially for the price) that has all the cable channels I pay for without actually having to pay extra for a cable box (or even be connected to the cable outlet). The wifi works well, I can watch Plex (with the caveat mentioned above), TV (via the FIOS app), Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc. without stuttering despite the router being on a different floor. Still, if there's ever an open source OS so I can jailbreak this puppy (maybe just replace its Amazon OS with something like OpenELEC), I'll be all over it.",0
1,"Hot garbage
  
",15.Dec.18,Yes,"Yuck - 1 year in, the remote is dust  and replacing it is a nightmare.  The interface is 95% Fire and 5% TV (you cant just scroll thru channels!). I thought I was getting a Toshiba 4K TV with built in Fire...not the case.No manual online, no basic controls on the TV to adjust sound.  $300 wasted - Amazon I love ya but this is a complete dog.  I'll tread carefully knowing your brand doesn't mean quality in the future.",0

In addition to this when I try to turn it on in an attempt to restore functionality nothing happens.",0
5,"Its worth to buy
  
",16.Dec.18,Yes,Its a good TV we got this for our parents and they love it,1
5,"Exactly what I was looking for.
  
",16.Dec.18,Yes,"So first, let me point out by far the two worst things about this TV.  1) It is meant for the cord-cutters, if you primarily use only streaming apps then it's great, but if you want to use HDMI input or something like that it's not as good, although a new setting does promise to default to your last input I haven't tried it.  2) It is thick, many other posts have mentioned this, but even though I'd read those I didn't expect it to be as thick as it is, it's literally inches thicker than the old samsung it replaced, like whatever you're thinking on thick, just add a few inches, cause it is seriously thick, so thick that I want to buy another one of these for my main living room, but I'm not going to put a TV this thick into such a prominent public space.  I thought people were just complaining about it being thick, but that ""thick"" had to be okay still cause it was many years newer than my old TV.  Anyway, not a problem for me cause I use this as a TV in a back bedroom anyway, but I wouldn't be happy with how thick it is in my main living room.Now that all that's out of the way, I still give it 5-stars.  Why?  Cause it's freaking amazing.  First off the picture is 4k which was an upgrade for the TV this replaced, and the picture looks great.  I am also just using the stock TV speakers for now, and they're surprisingly decent for built-in speakers.  But what I love most about it, is how gosh darn quick and responsive the interface is.  When I power it on, it powers up near instantly, and when I open an app it acts like it's just alt-tab switching to it like it was already open, and when I navigate the apps, they move so quick.  I primarily use Plex, and on my old TV I had to wait for Roku to boot up, took forever, then I had to launch the plex app, which also took forever, then Plex was slow to navigate and would sometimes crash.  All those issues are gone with Fire TV built-into this TV.  Plex just opens instantly and navigates flawlessly, so quick, I love it, and since I primarily just use that one app where this TV is, this is perfect for me.Also, I didn't expect to care at all about the alexa-enabled feature, as I already have a bunch of echo dots and a lot of home automation...  however, I actually love the alexa remote.  I often ask alexa to do something, like set an alarm, or adjust lighting, ect...  and when the TV is on this can make alexa not hear me well.  However, with the alexa remote it automatically pauses the video while I press-to-talk to alexa, and automatically unpauses when I let go, and this surprisingly works out really well for me.This TV was seriously cheap, I got the 50"" for under $300.  That was a huge plus.  Also the whole reason I got it was it was one of the only 4K TV's on the market with Fire TV built-in.  That was important to me because I had having several remotes just to use the TV, I want to just always use the native TV remote, so buying a 4k TV and then adding an external Fire TV box wasn't an ideal solution for me.  Plus being alexa-enabled I can turn it on by voice with the other echos in the house, not a huge deal, but it is nice to be able to turn it on by voice as I'm walking towards the room it's in so it's ready to go when I get there, even though it does turn on extremely fast anyway.Overall, I just love how fast the menu is.  That's something you never really know until you get your hands on it, and it's such a stark contrast to the TV it replaced, that I want to replace more TVs with this for their 4k Upgrade, however, the thickness bothers me for a main living room.  I'd pay three times as much if they'd make a thin 65"" version of this and I'd buy it for the main living room.",0

There is no extra Fire Stick and it integrates the external TV antenna so that you do not have to change digital sources. It was easy to set up using my Internet using the on screen prompts.

Since when did Best buy become shipping experts? They need to stay in their lane. So now I still have a broken TV which no one will accept. Everyone pointing fingers and I still have a broken TV in a box. I am thinking this needs to be investigated by Amazon, Best Buy would have told me to go pound sand if it wasn't Amazon forcing them to take the return with an A-Z policy.

",8.Jan.19,Yes,"I've had this 50 inch TV for about a month now (delivered 12/6/18) and so far so good. It's very easy to use and the picture quality is great. The only thing I'm worried about is that the TV randomly makes a somewhat loud popping sound once in a while when it's on. It typically only happens once per time the TV is on, if that. I'm not sure what's making the noise. Other than that, no complaints.Update 6/19/19:The popping noise I mentioned above seems to have stopped but now my tv will occasionally disconnect from wifi. Unfortunately when it does this, the tv no longer detects my wifi which is very annoying.After having to reset the tv to factory settings the first time, which fixed it but then I had to reinstall all my apps, I called toshiba for assistance. The following steps will fix the issue1. Unplug the tv from the outlet/power source2. Hold the power button on the tv itself for 15 seconds (while disconnected from power)3. Plug the tv back in and use the remote to turn it on.This has worked for me the past few times it has disconnected from my wifi.My advice would be to maybe look for a better  tv. I expected more from a name brand like toshiba but I guess I was wrong. Hope this helps.",0

5,"Plug &amp; Play
  
",9.Jan.19,Yes,"Looking for a TV just to watch programs on streaming services-Prime, Hulu and Netflix? This is the TV for you!  We 'cut the cord' -no cable-  a year ago and only wanted a large screen tv for the family room. We have had the Toshiba 4K smart led tv for a month and have not been disappointed yet. Straight out of the box ready-took all of 20 minutes to set up. Fantastic color and sound. Love the energy efficient feature- if a program is paused for more than 5 minutes, the tv turns off automatically. Upgraded our WiFi bandwidth, and a 4k blueray non streaming player is the only electronic connected to the tv.  If you plan on watching cable programs and connecting multiple electronics, this tv may not be the right tv for you.  Keep in mind this is a 4K Ultra HD Smart LED Fire edition TV that may require 4K ultra hd updated cable service and 4K cables to connect other electronics for optimal performance.",3
5,"This TV is not for European market.
  
",10.Jan.19,Yes,"I really liked this TV-set. The image is excellent. I was pleasantly surprised by the very loud and clear sound of Onkyo's built-in loudspeakers. Initially I thought of acquiring a sound bar, but after listening of this TV, I realized that there was no need for that.Many built-in services, which unfortunately are not supported in Ukraine. But YouTube works flawlessly.By Bluetooth were connected the keyboard, headphones and mouse.What you I liked and what I did not like.1. The TV does not support the European power supply system at 220V-240V and therefore had to buy an additional transformer for $ 35.2. The TV does not support the Russian language either at the level of Alexa voice control, or at the level of the menu and fonts. (search on the Internet and in YouTube was solved using the keyboard).3. Many pre-installed services that are simply not supported in Ukraine. How to download domestic supported services  is unclear.4. There is no DVB-T2 digital broadcasting tuner, which are present in almost all TVs designed for the European market._No more complaints about the TV there.Great machine for 300 dollars.",0

",20.Jan.19,Yes,I loved this tv until a couple of days ago. I purchased it Nov. 29 2018 and it started Jan. 18 2019. Worked great and the I turned it on and there was white lines going down the left (looking at it) side of the screen. It quickly moved to the whole top 2/3rds of the screen. I turned it off and back on and it went back to the side. Got to watch tv until I fell asleep. Next day same thing for a few minutes and then can't watch anything.

5,"Amazing TV, Great Price for what you get.
  
",23.Jan.19,Yes,This is the first TV I ever bought and I did a lot of research into getting a TV and what brand to buy and all the add on on the TV. I read a lot of the customer reviews and comments on here and was really weary about getting this TV.  I've had it a little less than a month and I've never been so happy about a purchase before until I bought this. I bought the Toshiba 43-inch 1080p Full HD Smart LED TV - Fire TV Edition. The sound quality is amazing and is loud! Which is good. The TV displays the colors of what you watch beautifully and its not all weird looking. I run my xbox 1 through the HDMI and I had no trouble setting it up. For a price of $229.99 you get a lot out of it.The only difficulties I had was starting up the TV and logging into Amazon Fire but that was only because the WiFi I have is really bad. I connected to my Hotspot and it logged in perfectly fine and updated after without issue.,2

",25.Jan.19,Yes,"This review is for the 43"" 4k version.The good: I think the picture quality is great for the price though blacks could be a bit deeper but I haven't tried changing the settings at all so this may be remedied. I thought the sound quality was great after switching it to Movie mode. I love that it comes with mounting screws for wall mounts. The overall look of the tv is pleasing. The OS is overall pretty snappy, quick. I love the remote, being that all I've used for the past 4 years is the firestick I love finally having everything integrated into one control.The not so good: I hate that when adjusting the picture quality it stays on the menu screen. You need to be able to see the video while making changes or else you're just guessing, hence me not changing it yet.Overall, I'm super pleased with my purchase and think I got a great value.",1

",27.Jan.19,Yes,Awesome TV for the price!!!!! Christmas was a success!,0
4,"Mediocre TV, but at a Good Price and with Nice Integrate Features
  
",27.Jan.19,Yes,"First and foremost, realize that just because this says ""4K"" does not mean it will be of any exceptional image quality. Most HD formats are 1080 anyway, so you don't really gain much with 4K, plus your eye can't even discern the difference in pixels on a screen this size at normal viewing distances. 4K is mostly a marketing gimmick for this TV. Other factors much more significantly affect image quality, such as contrast and local dimming, which this TV is noticeably lacking. Similarily, realize that this is NOT an HDR TV. It can play back HDR content, but will only display it in SDR and with a normal color gamut. It's not a bad TV for an affordable option if you're not a cinephile or expecting too much for a bargain deal. The Fire TV integration is nice since you can control it with your voice using either the included remote or a connected Alexa device, but the tradeoff is that using this TV with over the air antenna broadcasts is cumbersome as the channel guide does not allow simply clicking from one channel to another. That is, there is no channel up or down button, and you cannot type in a channel number and go to that channel, so channel surfing is not possible on this TV. Instead, it shows a smart guide with a thumbnail and title of the current program, the name of the network, and the schedule of what is upcoming, but it does not show the channel number, so you will have to relearn what you call all your regular over the air channels! A nice bonus is being able to pause live TV (but only for a few minutes- enough for a bathroom break), but you cannot record programs per se, or skip commercials. The sound is actually surprisingly good for an economy TV, but the blacks and contrast are lacking for cinematic movies.",0

1,"Apps are laggy &amp; crash, ads ON YOUR TV ITSELF
  
",7.Feb.19,Yes,"We got this TV on sale on Cyber Monday because we had been looking for a bigger TV for a while. Honestly, we already had Chromecasts and Android TVs so we didn't want a smart TV but it's basically impossible to find a non-smart 4K TV these days &amp; this one was ridiculously cheap. We knew the reason behind the ridiculous price was going to be that it's an Amazon TV &amp; it would have the sub-par Alexa crap &amp; probably have ads but we had no idea the extent to which this thing would suck. Connecting other devices to it is annoying to say the least, changing inputs is not streamlined whatsoever. It's SUPER laggy and the apps are always crashing on the smart TV itself so the difficulty changing inputs is really annoying. Now, let's talk about the ADS! Yes, we should always expect smart devices to be listening to us and advertising to us but this TV feels like a new level of invasion. Every time you turn your TV on, you're getting advertised to watch an Amazon show or buy an Amazon product. If you don't turn down the volume, you'll be rudely surprised by a loud advertisement before you even open an app to choose a show. Just buy a more expensive TV, you get what you pay for.",0

I've had an Amazon account for a bit &amp; finally bit the bullet with getting a Prime account.  The picture &amp; colors on the TV are super nice.  We didn't have to change much of the settings, more a less, just the audio is what we adjusted a very small bit.  We checked for an update 2 days after we got it &amp; the install was very quick.

3,"Features are amazing, display is NOT
  
",12.Feb.19,Yes,"I recently replaced my old 720 off-brand LED TV which had been working great for many years with this product. I selected this TV for the features and the fact that the 4K display would be amazing compared to my old 720.The features turned out to be great! We have the TV connected to Alexa. I love the fact that you can combine antenna channels with your streaming services like Prime, Netflix, and Hulu. We just need to tell Alexa ""Tune to CNN"" and she will turn on the TV, open Hulu, and launch the channel. If we say ""Tune to channel 3"", she will open our local antenna feed. That part is absolutely amazing.However, the display is a completely different story. The 4K display on this unit looks horrible compared to all of my other 1080 and 720 TV's. When I first turned it on, my wife was so upset with the horrible display that she wanted me to return it.You can find websites that provide the recommended/optimal display settings and it helped but it still isn't that great.Overall, the screen is always washed out and there are no dark tones. Everything is either too bright or washed out. I was expecting crisp detailed video like other HDTV's but not with this unit. I can't tell the difference when viewing something in 4K vs normal HD.",0
2,"You get what you pay for. Spend a little more and get a better TV.
  
",15.Feb.19,Yes,"I bought this on Amazon Prime Day in January in spite of all the bad reviews because I had already bought a larger one on Prime Day last July (2018) and haven_ had any problems with it.  I can confirm that the negative reviews were only slightly exaggerated. This is very low quality HD.  I don_ have the vocabulary to accurately describe the problem, so I will say that the picture quality is very poor.  A good HD television should give you seamless and flawless movement. This Toshiba does not provide that seamless-ness.  I can live with that.  What frustrates me is that sometimes the volume is too low for no apparent reason, or it will have no volume at all. The only way to restore the volume has been to turn the TV off and try again.  I noticed that when I would manipulate the Alexa remote to change channels (I_ streaming), the volume would cut out entirely.  Additionally, sometimes, I_l turn on the unit and my streaming service asks me to login again.  The programmed information _lips from time to time, requiring me to login before I can use the television. I find this annoying.  In other reviews, people complain about needing to reprogram the television and re-download the apps you use.  That has never happened to me.  I took those negative reviews seriously, and kept the box to be able to re-pack the contents if I needed to return it in 30 days.  I kept it because the television works fine. I use it about 30 minutes every night and it_ reliable. Nevertheless, I believe it_ true that you get what you pay for. I paid less than $150 for this television, so I can live with it, but I wouldn_ recommend this television brand to anyone.",8

I barely have the sound over a level 5 (it's loud) the screen quality is clear, and it functions as it should.I ran across my first issue with the TV 3 months in when everything stopped streaming and there was no issue with my internet or other devices. I discovered troubleshooting that says to clear the data/cache for three troublesome apps then restart.I now do this once a month for all the apps (I have a lot) and everything works fine.If you use the Fire TV App you can utilize a keyboard for signing in to everything, which is handy or you can also use a bluetooth keyboard. The app is also handy when your toddler temporarily loses the tiny remote - and the use of parental controls to prevent unwanted impulsive toddler purchases.I stream through probably 10 services and this TV is all I need!4 stars for the extra step each month but not the worst problem to have!",1

The tv shuts off within 10-15 minutes if you're not actively watching something, and I haven't been able to find anyway to turn off that feature.  It's so frustrating to be in the middle of watching a movie, YouTube video, etc, and have to start all over from the home screen if I pause it for even a short time.I've seen a couple message boards recommend installing 3rd party apps that would fix this, but none of them seem to work, and I shouldn't have to install additional apps just to keep a tv from turning off in the first place!",8

",28.Feb.19,Yes,"It is working great so far!  Lots of updated in beginning, but be patient!  I dinged a star because I was mounting it to a wall, and it did not come with bolts for back of tv.  It required an M4x35mm, which I had to run to the hardware store to retrieve.  So buy these exact bolts ( and washers if needed) and you'll be fine.

HDR has better picture quality than UHD. HDR is defined below.HDR should not be confused with UHD (Ultra High Definition), also known as 4K. Both HDR and UHD are meant to improve your viewing experience, but they are hugely different technologies with almost no overlap. It_ a matter of quantity and quality.

",9.Mar.19,Yes,"Without a doubt this tv has the best speakers I've ever heard, no need for a ""sound bar.""  But almost every day of my life I wake up sorry for buying it because inside it is the jankiest piece of what? I've ever dealt with.  Turn it on, and wait.  Change channels, and wait some more.  It buffers endlessly, needs frequent re-starting and is SO not all that good of a deal anymore.",0

",10.Mar.19,Yes,"What seriously I can_ use YouTube because of some petty spat between amazon and google, this tv is going back, getting a roku one",1
4,"Good price  But takes some learning for the smart feature  integrating  live cable programing.
  
",12.Mar.19,Yes,"What i liked was a that it seamlessly connected to my cable network and easily set up my cable channels for _ive channel programs. What I do not like is the accompanying _ser info which is really skimpy on instruction for accessing  programs. I STILL CANT FIGURE OUT  how to easily access my regular tv channels.  Apparently this tv is for _lexa instructions  so you need to know the exact station  and / or program you want. ( no I have yet to figure that out, so perhaps I am missing something. The other negative (problematic)  aspect is that dit keeps asking me to take a _ubscription for many of the channels ( even though I already have a subscription OR  can access on my other tv with  my bought amazon firestick.  I could move the firestick upstairs to it and plug it in and go through that, but that does seem counter productive. The remote does not allow direct channel access  as on a regular remote. I am continuing to study and experiment  so, readers of this review, please be aware of my limited knowledge  before you discount this tv as I am probably doing something wrong with accessing programing, as the box does say  seamlessly integrates cable live programing ...  ( not for me)",1
4,"Good product
  
",13.Mar.19,Yes,After reading other reviews I purchased the warranty.  Its only been in use for 1 month. It was packaged well and the set up instructions were very easy to understand.,0
3,"Could've been stolen, no outer box
  
",13.Mar.19,Yes,"It came in the t.v box, no outer protection box or concealment box. Everybody driving past my house seen I had a brand new t.v on my porch. The t.v itself is amazing, but that could've been really bad if somebody walked past and stole it.",0
1,"Disappointed
  
",14.Mar.19,Yes,"I've had this product for a couple of weeks.  The remote always seems to need an update.  So you can't just turn on the tv and start using it, you have to wait until the remote updates itself.  Was advised that you cannot switch the remote to a manual update mode, so unfortunately you are stuck with a remote that essentially hijacks your tv and prevents you from using it until it lets you.  Very annoying and frustrating.Update August 2, 2019:  TI have given up on the TV, it is now unplugged and just collecting dust until I figure out a way to get it into storage.  Please spare yourself a lot of grief and do not buy this product.",0

3,"Sound lags
  
",18.Mar.19,Yes,"While using the installed Netflix or Amazon prime video, the sound eventually starts to lag. It works fine if you use an Apple TV or Firestick, but the installed apps lag. I checked online, and there doesn't seem to be a fix or update for this issue yet. The screen and clarity are fine. It's a good size for the kitchen.",0

",20.Mar.19,Yes,Had a weird smell for the first few days of using it. Was concerned initially however it seems to have faded over time. Will continue to monitor to ensure it keeps working,1

",20.Mar.19,Yes,We haven't had this TV for that long. An it's already starting to not work. It won't show the home screen an I can't use any other button on the remote besides the one to turn it on,0
2,"Not HD at all !!
  
",22.Mar.19,Yes,Not really 4K. My normal HDR TV has much better clarity. It suxks . So disappointed !! Paid quite a bit for this TV. Not worth . Rather get a TV FROM A BETTER COMPANY,0
3,"Best FireTV product
  
",23.Mar.19,Yes,"*** UPDATE ***  1 year later... I still really like the TV but there is a problem with the remotes that come with this tv, after my remote started acting up, I started looking around and there are a lot of people who bought this tv with the same issues.  I thought it was just a little glitchy at first because my issues weren't as bad as others have reported but then my remote stopped working all together.  Super annoying that the remote doesn't work because there are no controls on the actual tv and if you're lucky to pair your phone or tablet to the tv you can use the app as a remote but flipping through youtube or netflix using the phone remote gets real old fast.  You can buy a replacement remote but you have to make sure it's the right one, with Amazon naming everything the same that isn't compatible makes ordering something as simple as the remote a challenge, besides the real issue is that a remote should last longer than my underwear!Love this tv... not ideal for cable users, but is great for internet services and over the air tv. I would recommend this tv to anyone who likes to use net based tv watching!",0
1,"Amazon You Should Be Ashamed To Put Your Name On This TV!
  
",23.Mar.19,Yes,"This is my 2nd set. It is the worst tv I have ever owned. It keep freezing or won't load programs unless I unplug it and let it reboot. That gets very old every time you want to watch a show on Hulu, CBS or any other channel.  AMAZON should be ashamed to put their name on this product!",1

3,"Overall a decent budget TV if you have lower expectations, Sling has flickering issue
  
",25.Mar.19,Yes,"The TV is decent for what you get as long as you don't want to use it as a main family TV. They are good for bedroom TVs or a multi-TV March Madness setup. Just don't expect the best picture at 720P. I have an annoying issue on both TVs while using the Sling app. The screen will start flickering very fast quite often (every 5-10 minutes), which may induce seizures. Waiting for Sling to respond or if a future update fixes it.",0
2,"Unresolved Volume Problems.
  
",25.Mar.19,Yes,"While we were originally happy with this TV it wasn't long before the sound started to dramatically jump. Repeated calls to Amazon have us going through the same trouble shooting steps over and over again updating the software and changing settings. If those steps manage to fix the problem it's only temporarily and within a week or two the problem returns. On top of that, each time we go through this process we then have to re-download all our apps and sign back into them.Amazon techs eventually seem to throw their hands up and tell us to call Toshiba. Who in turn insist that it's a software problem and to call Amazon.I understand that sometimes a specific unit may simply be a lemon and that it's not a problem inherent to the model or brand. However, with the problems we've had with this TV and the inadequate fixes from Amazon, I'd be VERY hesitant to purchase another Fire TV from them and would HIGHLY suggest anyone considering this one to keep this in mind when weighing their options.",0
5,"Very Impressed
  
",26.Mar.19,Yes,"Got this as a budget tv for my office.  I find myself watching it more than my 55"" tv in my family room.  Picture is great, sound is decent and the built in Fire TV is so easy to use.  It's simple, plug it in and watch tv.  It's wifi, so it syncs with your network and no wires to run!  It's REALLY light, so I'll take it to the patio, or even watch a movie in the bath once!",0

",1.Apr.19,Yes,This replaced an older 32 tv in our bedroom that we used with a Firestick. This Toshiba has it all built in one package. The WiFi connection got back better so no more buffering. Very nice picture. One remote for all controls and voice controlled.,0
1,"Peak TV Has Passed, not good as a monitor
  
",1.Apr.19,Yes,"Won't stay connected to HDMI even when you tell it to use it as default. It looks once and if it can't see the PC input it gives up and you have to use the remote once the computer boots. Meanwhile, you are forced to stare at some fake model family screensaver. I don't like the way it manages the appearance settings. Can't just blank out the screen with a powersaver mode and listen to audio in the dark, like you can on LG. Less than one percent of the content is available in 4K, and older computers can't match its display type (1080 p v. 4k.) The internet slot is mounted backwards (should be plug outside, not in.)Data hog, reverted to basic setup within two weeks. Tried all the free stuff: Netflix, Prime, Hulu, Boomerang, AMC, Newsy, etc. Ran out of watchable content in a week.Disappointed in how it isn't good for Amazon shopping compared to Fire tablet or a PC or phone. Might have some potential as an Amazon Camera monitor or security system, but Alexa doesn't understand much, and I 'm not going to train her how to do her job. Games are fun, but you need a real controller and the one I ordered didn't work, so I gave up on that.Decent packaging, easy setup. I like the solid feel of the base (legs) and you can set it on stands smaller than the screen size.Time to let TV die. Far more interesting things to do. Have you heard of this interactive thingie called the internet? It's so much better than zombievision.",1

",2.Apr.19,Yes,"I had decided to drop the dish and move to another service. I had narrowed my choice down and saw that the Fire TV Stick was supported. I purchased the sticks for the other TV's in the house and decided we needed a new TV for the living room.To be honest, I bought the TV because it was a Fire TV, figuring no stick was required. After getting the TV I was extremely surprised and pleased with the quality of the picture on this set, especially for the price I paid. The picture is very colorful and clear. Setup was a breeze and with the built in Alexa, it is easy to find a movie or just choices to pick from. I have no issues with the remote.If your looking for an exceptional buy, you must check this one out.",0
5,"Awesome quality for the price
  
",3.Apr.19,Yes,"You cannot get anything better for this price. It is not a premium TV, but the overall quality is really good. 4k, hdr (very poor), 3 HDMI ports, a really good remote with Alexa, and what is more important, a decent image and sound quality for the price you are paying.",0

4,"Great TV for the price.
  
",13.Apr.19,Yes,"PRO""SI purchased this TV back in October for our bedroom thinking that it would be easy for my wife to operate since it's voice controlled.  I read the pertinent reviews at the time and was a little leery about the poor  quality as reported by some viewers but I have had Toshiba products in the past and never had a problem with the brand.  I was pleasantly surprised that the picture quality and the sound are equal to the much more expensive Samsung's that I have in the rest of the house.  I might add that I set this TV to play through basic cable and air only, not a cable box.  Since I live in a large 2 story house I did have to use a Wi-Fi extender.  I am very impressed with this TV.CON""SAs I said I purchased this for a bedroom and being that this TV is voice controlled it gets annoying at times when one person is trying to sleep and the other person is trying to switch channels or apps by saying ""Alexa take me to Hulu"" or ""Tune to channel 76"".  I would much rather prefer a digital remote control over the voice operated.  Unfortunately, they don't make one.  Even so, I would purchase this TV over again.",0
3,"Great TV but it Failed After 9 months, Otherwise 5 Stars
  
",16.Apr.19,Yes,"Bought this TV on July 2018 Prime Day. Great Price, delivered on time, easy set up.  I have Direct TV as well.  While I had great customer service from Amazon, Toshiba (thankfully the TV was still in the 1 yr warranty period) and Best Buy, it is a little upsetting that the TV failed after only 9 months of rather light use.  New one is on its way.Picture is great and the sound quality is very good.  Set up wasn't too bad and there are a lot of tweaks you can make. Have this in the bedroom and didn't need to add a sound bar.  I bought an extended warranty from Best Buy for the replacement since I now don't have confidence in Toshiba TVs.  Why? Best Buy was ready to give me a credit for what I paid for the TV (to use to by any other TV they carry), but since I bought it on Prime Day, that credit would not have bought me much TV, by comparison.  So I stuck with the same TV.  Fingers crossed.",0

1,"Not worth it.
  
",29.Apr.19,Yes,"I had just got the toshiba fire tv and noticed a few things that were missing that android tv had. One was that for some weird and unfortunate reason there are no you tube, you tube tv, or built in chromecast which I truly think it the most important feature to have. Why in the world would you not get this? Also the brightness is not working as it is overridden by the backlight which makes the app too dark.The Sony Android tv had more apps to choose from chromecast and the picture is clearer than Toshiba fire tv. It is a damn shame that amazon limits its app choices. It seems like it is doing the same thing as Apple Appstore. I have an iPad and iPhone and apple has been from the beginning done this since they started out. And Amazon is doing this too. Such a shame because you are no better than Apple. You are the same. Not allowing android apps to be on your fire tv and fire stick for that matter.  And no chromecast either. It makes me wonder why I even went with your product if you are not allowing this. You have android but not google services. Makes no sense.",0

",8.Jun.19,Yes,"Long learning ""How to use"" The remote Control and TV Setups.

(Works perfect on my case) as a second Computer Monitor. Windows 10. The TV itself has an Operation System Inside. You may Cut The Cable for Tv. and Use the Applications offered on it. Many required pay. some are free like your location Tv Channels. Have not use any Antena with this tv. But if you have one use it. But local channels are offered for free must of then.Sound and Picture are great on my 43"" You may not need one but if you have Using the Optical output will give you a super sound. Wish Amazon and Toshiba update to a more reliable and simple set up. The Remote, or TV is on need of Bluetooth to make easier set up. The Alexa voice feature has the  problem, it is not multilingual. Mean less customers willing to buy. To many Stupid activation's why can not be one Period?...GrrrrrFor the Price worth to buy still.

1,"FireTV feature is not worth it
  
",9.Jun.19,Yes,"Being a fan of FireTv devices and our old television burning out, this seemed to make sense.When we first got the unit, it worked as expected. Started noticing some glitches during the first month, like screen freezes, lost signals, and the occasional flickering. It wasn't clear if the TV or the cable service was to blame for these issues.Then it became clear; the TV would completely crash and reboot whenever using apps like Hulu or Netflix. Watching cable or local channels were fine, but anytime an app was used to view/stream video from the internet, the TV would eventually crash. (Especially during camera panning or quick action scenes.)I have three other FireTV devices, not built into a TV set, and we have never had this issue. So I'm guessing they made this TV as cheap as possible with an inferior memory/chipset that can't handle the workload. It's clear the TV works fine for cable/antenna viewing, but the functions as a FireTV are not there.So now, to avoid the crashes, I attached an old FireTV box via HDMI cable. No crashes since I did that.  We avoid using the built-in FireTV as much as possible.Bottom line: If you want this TV because of the FireTV option - you can do better. We would have done better purchasing a standard HDTV without the built-in FireTV -- and then attach the old FireTV unit to that.",15

",13.Jun.19,Yes,"Bought this for a back porch tv. The picture and sound are superior to my aging sony which has amazing picture and sound. My first experience with a smart tv. Love it ,love the voice feature on the remote. A lot of performance for the price.",0
2,"Meh, some annoying features, but meh.
  
",16.Jun.19,Yes,"I got it at a good price, lower than the current one.  I don't use it as a smart TV, I don't want amazon spying on me like that so I cant speak to those features.Some annoying things about this TV is that when the computer turns off the display and then resumes it the display will not work.  It will just sit there with a gray screen until you go back to the menu and select the HDMI port again.  The TV when 'off' has a blue LED bright enough to light up the entire room.  The remote has some sort of RF functionality but it wont work to turn the TV on, you have to use the old fashioned line of sight infra red emitter to turn it on which means you cant block the blue eyeball searing beam and still have the ability to turn on the display.  When you do turn it on it never resumes the last hdmi port you had set you have to select it all over again each darn time.So those are the things I would see fixed, auto resume when an HDMI port returns from a sleep state, return to the last used hdmi port when powered on and remove that diabolical LED.",0

",16.Jun.19,Yes,"I was a bit afraid of ordering this online, as some reviews indicated it might arrive damaged. It got here intact and I am impressed with the whole thing. Great picture, The remote has buttons for several services, netflix, amazon video and a couple other things I do not use. Very easy to set up and get right to your apps. Wish it had a Hulu button, but it is a great tv. I cannot find a bad thing to say at this point. I waited a bit to review this, in case it developed any issues, but so far I am very pleased.",1

",19.Jun.19,Yes,"The TV is okay... but all of the Amazon specific stuff gets in the way more than you'd think. On initial setup it wanted me to log into my Amazon account, then it kept bugging me to use Alexa. No native Youtube app (you can download some third party app that works fine). Other apps work 50% of the time. Can't seem to turn the sleep function off of its 10 minute timer (sure-- burn in, but who really cares with such a cheap TV).And it has nothing to do with my internet, all the Amazon specific things work perfectly!",0

",27.Jun.19,Yes,"When I received this TV I paid an electrician $150 to set it up, everything looked fine, and upon turning it on, the HUGE crack became apparent, it is completely useless. Customer service has been awful and their ONLY suggestion was to get a refund and re purchase a TV. I needed this TV for family that were visiting, now they will not have a TV in their room, AND I will have to pay ANOTHER $150 to have this set up. DISGRACEFUL ... expected more from amazing and Best Buy.",2
1,"How Does Amazon Even Put Thier Name on This
  
",28.Jun.19,Yes,"I bought the TV about six months ago and wanted to wait some time before leaving a review. From day one, there were serious issues and I already mounted the thing before turning it on, otherwise I would have sent it back in a heartbeat.As soon as I turned on the TV, I noticed it took forever to load, figured that was an issue with first time use. NOPE, every time I turn it on, it takes almost a full minute to load up.Secondly, it turns off on it's own for no reason. Picture this, Game of Thrones final season and John Snow just stabbed the queen, dragon opens his mouth, and BAM, TV turns off. This happens at least once during an hour long program, so I literally have stopped watching anything worth while on the Toshiba Fire TV, reverting back to my 8 year old Samsung Plasma TV with Roku device plugged in to HDMI.Seriously a sad excuse for a TV and cheaper brands such as TCL in my home that are older, perform mountains atop this piece of crap. I don't see how a multi billion dollar company puts it's name on something that is obvious garbage and remains that way. Especially since it doesn't work with Alexa, which is why I bought this thing in the first place.",8

1,"Good for the price, but...
  
",6.Jul.19,Yes,"We've had this TV for almost a full year now and although the TV works great and it is super easy to use/set up, some issues keep coming up. 1) Often times when watching live TV and if you want to switch to another channel, the TV becomes nonresponsive. This can also happen when using an app, like Netflix. As a result, you are not able to change channels or switch between apps. It would show a message that it's trying to open the app ""forever""  2) After powering the TV, it won't connect to the Wi-Fi right away. It says the ""signal is weak"" even though the router is next to it. This means you can still watch live TV but the apps won't load.The only way to resolve both of these issues is by restarting the TV, which it's very inconvenient and frustrating but solves the issue at hand.I have contacted Amazon, which led me to Best Buy, which led me to Toshiba....we'll see how they respond to the issue and if they can replace the TV. Stay tuned...",3
1,"Don't Waste Your Money
  
",7.Jul.19,Yes,"Update: I have now had this TV for over a year and it_ a disappointment every time I turn the thing on. If the TV actually worked I would be fine with it, but it is glitchy 9/10 times that we turn it on. It freezes CONSTANTLY. The TV itself is fine. When I plug something into it through an HDMI port it works great. I will never purchase a fire TV again. The other very frustrating part is that the phone app no longer works...at all no matter what I do (restart router, turn TV on/off, delete/reinstall app, sign in and out of app, free up space on TV, clear change, etc.). I should be able to send/cast YouTube, Pandora, etc. to the TV, but it is somehow not equipped with this feature. I suppose I_l have to give in and purchase another streaming device so that this TV is usable. I_ really dissatisfied and disappointed with this TV.

5,"Shocking How Great This It
  
",17.Jul.19,Yes,"Terrific brand and just as described. I had only ordered this because of its incredible price ... and that it was bigger than my current TV.  Neither the 4K HD nor Amazon Fire compatibility mattered to me.  I was soooo wrong!!!  The  4K quality is incredible - even just to watch the morning/nightly news. What's more, if you hadn't discovered the amazing Amazon Fire TV capabilities - you gotta switch ASAP.  I thought (wrongly!) that having Amazon Prime Video capability on my iPad was sufficient (combined with streaming to TV), but was I wrong.  But ""THE"" key item I wasn't expecting at all was the number of free HD channels it was able to capture using my HD  TV indoor antenna (also purchased through Amazon).  Using my previous Smart TV (only 3 years old) I was only getting 14 channels (in reality only 10 because receptions for others were terrible), but suddenly the new Toshiba Fire TV was capturing over 30 channels WITH great quality (...using the same HD TV antenna I was using before placed exactly as before!!!).",1

It has Fire TV installed and turns on in Fire TV mode, then you have to switch to HDMI or antenna. There's no way start in HDMI or antenna mode. Another thing I don't like is all the controls are in Fire TV mode, so if I want to adjust the picture or set the sleep timer (this is my bedroom TV) I have to switch to Fire TV mode. My final complaint is it only came with a Fire remote. But, again, the picture is awesome.",0

4,"A good TV for the budget-minded.
  
",21.Jul.19,Yes,"Bought this on Prime Day, was a good price for a big tv. I read some of the negative reviews that the screen had some flickering issues after using it for some time. If that occurs with this one I_l come back and reevaluate the rating.So far, so good. Or at least it_ OK. The screen is nice, I don_ notice any whiteout in the corners. The colors are sometimes lacking, even after adjusting the Picture settings. I also notice that the blacks aren_ as black as they should be, it sometimes has a washed out look to the picture. Not happy with that, but we get what we pay for, which is why I_ not rating it lower than I have, at least not yet. No dead pixels, and the resolution is really sharp. I watched Planet Earth II on Netflix last night and was really blown away by the colors, clarity and resolution. This tv was definitely made for that kind of show, or the other way around maybe. Really it was like watching a different tv, that_ how much different (better) it looked. Over-the-Air HDTV looks really good too. Maybe it_ just the shows I was watching earlier that left something to be desired in the picture quality, but I_ just kind of puzzled as to the difference between one show and the next with this tv.Anyway, I should mention also that I tried cancelling this order a short time after reading some comparisons between this model and a similar size TCL, but Best Buy couldn_, or wouldn_, cancel the order even though the request was put in before shipment. So that being said, I_ recommend buying direct from Amazon if you can help it, rather than purchasing from Best Buy as a third party via Amazon. Again though, I saw the deal on Prime Day and grabbed it quickly before doing my research. But for a 50 4K UHD tv, I_ happy with the buy.The built-in Fire TV is also pretty awesome too. One remote for the whole shebang, rather than one for the TV and one for a Roku, which is what this tv replaced. Nice, clean interface, quick response. Go from streaming channels to over-the-Air channels with complete ease. Very happy with this aspect of the TV.Long story short, if you_e on a budget but want a nice entry level tv into 4K, this is a fine purchase. If you have a bigger budget to work with, do some comparison shopping first and read reviews, or go to a store and watch them side-by-side, like in the old days. :)",0

I have Dish satellite TV on HDMI-1 and use the Dish remote to power on/off my TV and control the volume,  It does this very well but this Toshiba Fire TV always powers on to the ""Home Screen"" despite setting the Power on function to always use the ""Last Input"".  That requires having to use the TV remote to select the HDMI-1 input every time I turn on the TV....Grrrrrr  Toshiba/Amazon needs to come up with a software/firmware fix for this problem.  I know I am not the only one who has complained about this issue !UPDATE:  7/25/2019I found out why the TV was not returning to the last Input when powered on.  I had inserted a USB flash drive into the USB port to test it, and that caused the TV to always return to the home screen and input was set to the USB port.  As soon as I removed the USB flash drive, it now returns to the Last Input (HDMI-1, Dish network) when the TV is powered on.  If you are having problems getting the TV to always power up to the Last Input, be sure you don't have anything plugged into the USB port.",0

",24.Jul.19,Yes,This TV can not be a smart TV without the app for Spectrum and Plex! Those are major Apps that all smart TVs have. Even Roku has them available. I looked everywhere just to find out that they are not available on the Fire TV........Even the fire stick has Plex but not Spectrum.,0
3,"No television controls if the remote dies and it seems to be an ongoing problem with this TV.
  
",25.Jul.19,Yes,"(***REVISION TO ORIGINAL REVIEW***)Everything below did happen and the information I was given on the replacement remote was totally incorrect. The gentleman I spoke with obviously didn_ understand his own system because the remote showed up the very next day. I have upgraded my review to three stars from 2. TV should still have manual controls in case of remote failure like this and downloading the remote app after a failure doesn_ assist since you still need to access the tv settings but can only be done with a remote.(**** end of updated portion of review****)(**below is the original failure write up**)  2 days into after I put it on the wall the remote stopped working. Called the number for Toshiba in the remote for troubleshooting. No remedy so they said they would send a new remote, no rush on their part as three days later I called for a tracking number. Oh it_ still processing and may take 2-3 more days until it ships? In the meantime we can watch one channel and can_ adjust the volume because they didn_ think to put any television controls on the TELEVISION!!! What??",1

",27.Jul.19,Yes,Tv remote stopped working after 5 uses. What a horrible experience. Amazon was very unhelpful. I_e been given the runaround from amazon to Best Buy to toshiba over and over!

",29.Jul.19,Yes,"So happy to see best buy using Amazon. I bought the TV with Dolby stereo and a 4k 50"" screen. Great picture and I'm loving the sound. A big plus is the Alexa voice remote, I didn't even know I needed this in my life! When the phone rings now I can say ""Alexa, mute the TV."" instead of searching for the remote.",1
1,"Didn't work
  
",29.Jul.19,Yes,This TV is not worth the money.  Right out of the box the remote stopped working before we could get all the way through set up.  I even changed out the batteries with new brand name batteries and we could not get it to work.  Returned immediately.,0

",30.Jul.19,Yes,"After reading lots of reviews, I was concerned that I was going to have problems with this TV, but I read and closely followed the instructions (I bought the M4 x 35mm mounting screws at Ace Hardware before it arrived) and was up on the wall and working in a very short period of time, maybe 30 minutes. Integration with my wi-fi system was simple and easy. Reception is good, even with my OTA antenna. Sound is good, too. I'm happy with my purchase",0

Software is easily overwhelmed  in antenna-channel rich area.While Amazon's software is usually very solid in functionality and content, they have completely failed with their off-air channel program guide and unfortunately this set does not have the normal EPG.Alexa does not function very well with the TV's settings or changing channels.",0

I DOWNLOADED A USER GUIDE AND STUDIED THE ANTENNA'S FEATURES AND USE OF THE BUTTONS. THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A MANUAL BUTTON INSTALLED ON THE TV TO OVERRIDE REMOTE TO DO THE SETUP. .  MOST OF THE ISSUE WAS CAUSED FROM MY UNFAMILARITY WITH THE REMOTE FUNCTIONS.

",4.Aug.19,Yes,"It_ great generally.  It doesn_ have regular buttons on the tv except for the the power/input button.  I think that_ ridiculous, but whatever.

I keep her disabled so that she_ not listening to everything we say.  4K isn_ even available most of the time, but when it is you can see a little difference.  People_ skin in 4K is so unnecessary, lol.  I don_ like that the speakers put the volume directly out of the back of the tv, not downward or upward.

1,"Terrible Remote, Good TV, Some audio timing issues.
  
",5.Aug.19,Yes,"REVIEW UPDATE: A month after I purchased it, the remote's power button stopped working. I opened it up in an attempt to understand the problem, but one of the screws was hidden under a customer support label, resulting in that part breaking. once I got under it, there was a differently-sized set of more than double the number that were on the outside layer. I gave up and threw away the remote, but I'm now finding that it doesn't really have good support for keyboard and mouse----Honestly, it's a great deal for the most part, but I've had some notable issues:1. Alexa on the TV refuses to pair with Alexa on my phone2. Quite frequently, the audio comes out earlier than video. This only happens with built-in apps, most frequently YouTube, but sometimes Netflix. This issue does not occur with Bluetooth audio devices or HDMI inputs to my current experience. Have not tested TOSLink output or RCA input.3. It boasts it's DTS surround sound certification upon every time you turn it on, yet it only seems to be stereo. Maybe if you turned it up really loud, it might have a trick for surround sound, but I've never tried that because I live in an apartment.The upsides:1. It's cheap, relative to other TVs.2. It works well for the most part.3. It's at least got the capability to use Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video, PS Vue and YouTube. HBO GO and HBO NOW depend on who you subscribe through. Xfinity only ""supports"" their DVR, Xbox, and PC. (Thank you for the inconvenience, Xfinity!) Your mileage will vary on that last bit.4. Durability: Cannot verify. I have it resting on a wooden board on a Piano Keyboard stand only covered by a single sheet. If an earthquake occurs, I'm screwed as far as this TV goes.",1
3,"Suggest professional installation
  
",5.Aug.19,Yes,"TV does not respond to on/off of remote. Must unplug it then reply, then press on and it works. Repeat the next time. Had to buy adapter to use my current cable box and need another $50 adapter to use my old dvd/vcr player. I haven_ done this. I don_ have Alexa so don_ know about that feature. The TV is very nice -once you get it working. Not user friendly",0
1,"Take consideration before purchase
  
",6.Aug.19,Yes,"I_e had this TV for a little over a month now which is enough time for me to form a thought through opinion, in short I do not recommend purchasing this. Now, to explain:Set up was simple yet complicated. Most TV_ ask a million questions when setting up and use phrases and references that the average person doesn_ understand. This TV does not which was great, it_ quite simple actually. You put in your WiFi info and it asks very simple and straight forward questions. The complicated or moreso anxiety ridden part was that it took over an hour because it _hecked for updates a total of 7 times which made me wary of how old this model or specific unit was.Second, this TV freezes wwwaaayyy more than it should. Twice now I_e had to unplug it because it froze up.Third and maybe most of all is that the remote is garbage. The TV has no buttons at all so it_ completely reliant on the remote which only works when it feels like working. Buttons get stuck, like I_l be scrolling and it_l decide to just keep going. Worst of all is the volume button, I_l go to turn it up one or two notches and it_l get stuck and go all the way to 100 which I will frantically be trying to turn down. Sometimes the volume down does the same thing and I_l miss something because of it.All in all, I got this TV but there was a super sale, I spent less than $200. That being said you_e getting what you pay for, know that.",1
2,"Pretty letdown
  
",7.Aug.19,Yes,Pretty disappointed with this TV. While it's supposed to be 4k my switch and PlayStation look noticeably worse then on my other hd TV's. I find the Fire software to be bloated and clunky to use. Like I'd rather it be just a TV first rather then an Amazon/Alexa device. But I learned my lesson with what I thought was a too good to be true deal on Amazon day.,0

",9.Aug.19,Yes,"Textbook case of getting what you pay for.Bought one on Prime Day at a good price, and I was honestly impressed by the TV at first.Then I noticed multiple specks of dust beneath the outer layer of glass. I could've tolerated the 3 or 4 specks tucked in the top-right corner, but the large, ugly one right-of-center was a deal-breaker for me. It's too much of a distraction when bright pictures are being displayed on screen. I begrudgingly endured it for 2 weeks before deciding to return the TV. I figure to have a 4K TV this cheap, they had to cut corners somewhere.Too bad it was in the Quality Control department.Also, the TV would shut itself off seemingly at random. Judging by the other reviews, thia seems to be a recurring issue. Go figure.",2

It is a nice to see what is on each station currently and in the future.  It is being used in a camper environment.  The internet function works very well with a weaker signal.,0

1,"PACKAGE YOUR PRODUCTS BETTER!!
  
",27.Aug.19,Yes,"TV arrived with a huge crack in the screen. Packaging is lame, center of the box has no support and was visibly caved in when I found it on my doorstep. Unpacked to find only foam at the top and bottom of the TV and no packaging material what-so-ever to support the center, so if you get one of these in one piece, you'll be lucky. Ordered this for my travel trailer to be able to watch movies on our vacation. Thanks Best Buy/Amazon, for putting a dent in my plans.",0
5,"Great value
  
",28.Aug.19,Yes,Great value for the price I paid. $99 special at Amazon!  Box marked from Best Buy. Good picture and ok sound. I use my BT speaker with it. The only thing I don_ like is that it_ not as easy to toggle back and forth through the apps as my other televisions are,0
4,"Worked like a charm out of the box
  
",28.Aug.19,Yes,No issue syncing up the tv even though the router is in the basement and the tv is on the 2nd floor.  Also no issue getting local channels.  And the picture/sound quality with no sound bar is good.  What is not to like for the price...,0

",29.Aug.19,Yes,"I have had this TV for 2 days and it already isn't connecting to wifi. Because it uses a smart remote the only button that works is the power button. I've tried unplugging, resetting my wifi router, everything. It's a shame because the 2 days it worked it was a nice TV. I have to return it now and deal with that BS.",0

4,"Toshiba Is a Great Brand
  
",4.Sep.19,Yes,Great television..has alot of features I haven't explored yet..like the Alexa feature..dislike that it doesn't have a nite view as the screen is bright at nite and it's in bedroom..have to put picture mode on PC and it dims some..also the home screen is very busy alot of different apps and suggestions..there is no way to stop sleep time so if you have to leave the room for awhile it will sleep and you have to search for program again or launch the app you were using and you MIGHT be able to resume from where you left off. Purchased Toshiba because I have a 2002 Toshiba still going strong but wanted a smart tv.,1
5,"Didn't think I wanted or needed Alexa but nice actually
  
",4.Sep.19,Yes,I didn't think I wanted or needed Alexa but now I'm a fan.  I loved my Samsung but now I'm amazed at how easy this is to use.  It's a great TV and I love it.

",5.Sep.19,Yes,"Feeling this was a good buy during Amazon Prime. Happy to have a Smart TV with a good-sized screen.  I always wish a paper instruction manual was included, but that never seems to be the case with any new electronics purchase.  It is assumed we will ""google"" our questions.  Not convenient in my mind.  Don't use Alexa much, but that's a personal choice.",1

",6.Sep.19,Yes,"The TV is just amazing. The picture is much better than my $2500 main tv. The sound is so good we have to put the volume on #3-4 in my daughters room at night so she can sleep. Her old TV was #11. Everything works seamlessly. And it slipped right on our old wall mount. I want one in my living room and my bedroom now too!The ONLY issue we had was the box it was shipped in had a fist sized hole in it all the way down to the screen. Since it was her birthday gift, I had to open it ahead and inspect the screen prior to gifting it and thankfully all was ok. I know that's not Amazon's fault and a risk you take with shipping. I know some shippers use large boxes as a dance floor, a punch bag or even an airport runway. Possibly even a lot hole cover, but ours wasn't damaged this time!",0

",9.Sep.19,Yes,"Purchased TV during the Prime Day Deal. Great price but the quality of the TV is not that great. 3-4 times a week, I am restarting the TV to get access to apps to just watch a show. Frustrating. This is my only built in Fire Stick TV and I would definitely just stick to the portable stick or Roku. I do like the smart features and the extras like personal photo screen saver etc.  For the price, I would just use the TV in a room or location that requires less use.",0

4,"Great for the Price
  
",11.Sep.19,Yes,"This is a quality T.V. I bought on special during Prime Days. That said, if you have a Prime membership and Alexa and you just want to be a couch potato this is for you. You also need a good WiFi connection to get all the features it provides. The picture quality is great. I gave it 4 stars overall because not everyone is going to have WiFi and such to be able to use all the features. If you have WiFi this little unit can't be beat for the price.",1

",16.Sep.19,Yes,"La pantalla se ve muy nitida y brillante, es muy ligero en comparación a mi tv anterior. Funciona perfecto con Netflix y Youtube aqui en Venezuela.

5,"Highly recommend getting this especially during Prime Day
  
",16.Sep.19,Yes,This TV was an amazing deal! I never cared for getting a smart TV since we usually use our Xbox to watch Netflix and Hulu but this TV was such an amazing price and great size that we couldn't say no. I love not having to have to turn on my Xbox anymore to watch my shows and have 2 different controls. Now I have everything all in one on a great size TV. I would highly recommend this TV,0

",17.Sep.19,Yes,I love this tv it is the best!!!!! Just wish it had vudu!Also do not mess up your remote i had to replace the remote.........stupid thing cost $50 THE TV WAS LIKE $130 so IMO the tv was $80 and the remote was $50,0
5,"Great TV for the price
  
",17.Sep.19,Yes,"It_ been several months and I would recommend this TV. It syncs perfectly with Alexa and if you already had a fire stick or tv adapter, everything loads once you boot up. It_ also really light and can sit on most stable surfaces. Mine is on a glass console.",0
4,"Great
  
",18.Sep.19,Yes,"Picture is really good and reception (tuner) seems to be good quality. We use an antenna for our ""regular"" TV viewing and this TV receives the channels very good. The only complaint I would have would be that the channel guide doesn't have the channel numbers on it only the network or call signs. Other than that so far the TV has been working great.",1
3,"Haunted TV
  
",21.Sep.19,Yes,"I also picked this TV up during Prime ""Time"". What a deal. Nice features , gorgeous screen and the video is loud enough so that we don't have to re connect the Bose speakers. With that said --this is the most erratic TV ever. First the sound on commercials on one channel went. Next time it just didn't want the sound of the local channel 5-but sound on the commercials. Each time I unplugged everything---power, cable attachment--as well as doing set up again--audio preferences--everything reset . One day sound and no picture!. Then turning on a local (32 in Chicago) to watch the Bears game--the commentary was in Spanish. As much as I wished I had a second language--I don't. I looked at the language preference and it still was English. Instead of watching together we all went to our rooms where the Samsungs and Sony were broadcasting English. Next on WTTW Prime I was treated to a spoken account of all the visual movements. (Mary exits room-Tom sits down). I don't know if I am bemused or I'm ready to throw it out a window.",1

2,"tuner lacks features other 4K sets have
  
",28.Sep.19,Yes,"This set has a decent picture, decent sound, and the smart features work fairly well. The remote has no numerical buttons, so you have to pull up the channel guide to switch channels. And unlike my other smart TVs, this one does not tune all of the local broadcasting. It lacks the ability to tune in the 4 digit stations like my Samsung and LG sets can. I wish I had caught this before I destroyed the box or I would have sent the set back. Toshiba dropped the ball on this set",0

When it work, it works fine. Barely. But look I got it for amazing prime day last year and loved it initially but then updates came and keep breaking the TV and making it even worse. But I don't know how other TV compares but I'd rather plug a xbox or ps4 in and use it like a smart TV instead of this junk that is slow. I wish I could get my money back but it's been way to long and it is still the only TV I have.",1

5,"Not as bad as I thought after reading other reviews.
  
",5.Oct.19,Yes,"I bought the 43"" TV a few weeks ago and I am far from disappointed. It came a day earlier than the earliest expected delivery date, and setup was a breeze. There are two stands (or a wall mount if you went with one) and you have all of 4 screws needed to set it up. The manual is clear and helpful in not only installing the stands but the wall mount as well.As for the actual TV, the picture quality is wonderful. Like many others say, sound quality is okay, but I am far from an audiophile and admit that on occasion there it is difficult to hear what is said in spoken dialogue. Alexa works perfectly for me and has no trouble understanding my voice even with a somewhat thick french Canadian accent thrown into the mix. The settings a fairly average, with no unusual settings that you wouldn't see on any other TV.I would emphasize that the settings are incredibly easy to figure out and many other reviews mention issues that can be solved easily within 5 minutes of opening the settings menu. Things like turning on the TV and having it open to a specific input are entirely possible. I will also say that the TV seems incredibly fragile and that you should be careful setting it up, but there are instructions on proper removal and setup included in the box and following them should be more than enough to keep it safe. Finally, the TV does require a short boot when turning it on, but it takes all of a few seconds and honestly if the speed bothers you then a smart TV probably isn't your thing anyway.All in all, if you follow the directions, be careful with the TV, and take 10 to 15 minutes to set it up properly in the settings menu this is a great purchase. I bought this TV on sale at 200 dollars, and it was honestly the best purchase I've made in a while. It's a shame that bad reviews almost scared me away from it.",0
2,"Great TV, but lacking customization.
  
",5.Oct.19,Yes,"The TV itself is great. Picture is amazing. The FireTV built in is really awesome. The remote the best remote we_e ever had probably. However, and the only reason this gets a low rating, the TV has a built in auto off function that_ set to 5 minutes. This function CANNOT BE CHANGED OR DISABLED. AT ALL. My husband and I have researched up and down about fixing this feature and everywhere on the internet we find people complaining about it, they_e told it_ not possible unless you hack the firmware of the TV itself. Completely ridiculous.For anyone who thinks this may not be a big deal, let me put it into perspective. You_e halfway into a movie, you pause to go to the bathroom. When you get back, the TV is off. You have kids, like I do, and you need to pause to make lunch (or any other various reason kids would need), the TV turns off. You have to pause for a phone call, the TV turns off. I promise you 5 minutes sounds like an eternity but it isn_.We bought this TV on Prime Day because our old 4k was going out and being glitchy. Good deal for a 4K TV with great picture, but I hate this damn TV because of this one feature lol.You_e been warned lol.",0
1,"Awful Television.
  
",6.Oct.19,Yes,"This tv is just awful. The sound is _ff, the color is bad. I default to my old fire box to watch any streaming because this tv is bad. Waste of money. I wish I had my old tv. DO NOT BUY, no matter how deeply discounted.",0
3,"TV is great but....
  
",8.Oct.19,Yes,Honestly the tv it_ self is good. The picture brightness is a little hard to navigate. I play a lot of video games so this is annoying to me. The biggest problem I have had since purchasing in July is the remote. It slowly stopped working. It_ 42 dollars to replace it and I haven_ had any luck getting in contact with customer service on my issue. The tv is only 3 months old. The remote should not have given out so quickly.,0
1,"Defective screen and AWFUL customer service
  
",10.Oct.19,Yes,"This has been BY FAR the worst customer service experience I have ever had. Will never buy through Best Buy again and definitely will never purchase another Toshiba product EVER.Last month my Toshiba tv started having issues (see attached photos). The screen would be white/grey when turned on and non responsive. The remote wouldn_ do anything besides turn the TV off and on. Tried resetting the TV many times, researching online, and no solution.I finally decide to call Amazon and they tell me to call Best Buy. Best Buy tells me to call Toshiba. Toshiba sets up an appointment with guess who... the Geek Squad (Best Buy tech support).Geek Squad comes to the house and I explain my issue, and how I have tried resetting the TV many times and the issue always comes back. The Geek Squad resets my TV and the next day, the issue comes back. I call Toshiba and they tell me to bring the TV to a Best Buy store.So I_ standing in the Best Buy store and guess what they tell me....... CALL TOSHIBA. So now I_ ready to lose it but I_ trying to stay patient. On the phone with Toshiba and they say ..... wait for it ...... CALL THE GEEK SQUAD... because they are the _nly ones who can issue a return.At this point I don_ know what to do. I just want a working TV. This has been without a doubt the worst customer experience I have ever had. There is a 1 year manufacturer warranty, so Toshiba can issue the return, but they won_. No one wants to take responsibility for the TV that clearly is defective.Any advice if you have a similar situation would be greatly appreciated.",1

",14.Oct.19,Yes,I LOVE this tv. I got it on prime day and don't think I could have gotten a better price. The 4k picture is amazing. The tv menu shows prime shows in 4k so they are easy to find and watch. The menu is user friendly. The sound is good too for not having any kind of sound system and just using the tv. I'm very very happy with it. I was a bit nervous because some reviews said their tv was losing its pic about a month in but or showed up damaged. I've not had a single issue. I would definitely recommend this tv.,0

",15.Oct.19,Yes,"If you have problem, when only the power button works and nothing else, call the number inside the remote (877)527-2411 (US &amp; Canada only), and customer service will walk you through a procedure to reconnect the remote to the tv.

",17.Oct.19,Yes,"I waited a year to leave this review, full disclosure..I bought one 14 months ago and two months latter it completely stopped working. After weeks of back and forth between Best Buy and Amazon customer service I finally was able to ship that TV back and get it replaced with the one I currently have. I can honestly say after owning this latest TV for just over a year I love it. I am one of these people that is fully engulfed in the Amazon ecosphere. I do not have cable, I do not use an antenna, I am 100% Amazon video, Hulu, Netflix etc and it works perfectly for me. With each update it only gets better. If you are a true cord cutter this is the TV for you. I do not understand why people would buy this TV that still rely on cable? This TV is all about streaming. Yes you can pay much more and get a better picture but for the price it is perfect. I have this one in my bedroom and love it. Now if they would just make it in 75"" or bigger I would replace my old 85"" Vizio in my living room.",0

",17.Oct.19,Yes,"The TV was a gift to my mother-in-law but lasted only 3 months before it had problems. Unfortunately, I am still having problems getting Best Buy to honor the warranty or even respond to my attempts to get them to look at it. I never realized their customer service was so horrid. The TV is a Toshiba but according to their rep is made for Best Buy and the manufacturer_ 1 year warranty is suppose to be covered by them through their Geek Squad.",0

When you click on that it takes you to more screens that eventually lead you back to the first screen and it again tells you the item needs special attention.  No resolution there, even less help, just an annoying rabbit hole of nothingness.  Oh, don't click on the call us link because it too takes you to the same circular rabbit hole that will lead you back to the first page that starts you I the goose chase.So I tried calling Toshiba, explained my problem, was told it might be faulty HDMI cables..  Swapped out the cable on the non responsive Tv for the ones on the identical functioning Tv, still nothing, meanwhile the functioning Tv was working just fine with the cable taken from the non functioning one.  At this point they asked if I had any new cables...  I asked if by new they meant newer than the two month old cables I was using.....  He said that to remove all doubt about the cables, I should purchase a new one, and call back....  Ok fine...Bought new cables, no big deal here because I'll use them either way....  Called Toshiba again.... Went through the BS again and whammo.....  Still no sound from any of the inputs.  Art this point they suggest calling Amaon back.Went back to Amazon site, pulled up order, clicked return/replace...  Oh yeah, the rabbit hole...  Well, maybe I'm just dumb... So we try  it again...  Nope, not me, it's an actual rabbit hole...  ""Look kids, it's Big Ben!""  I think to myself as I start to circle around the loop.  At this point, I exit the Amazon site, I Google the customer service number and call in. ...Go over everything, explain everything I've done tell them it's my desire to have the item replaced only to be told that's not an available option....  That's it....I dunno, maybe it's just this manufacturer, maybe it's because despite buying the TV from Amazon it shipped from Best Buy, but the end result is I will never purchase another TV from amazon.... Less than 3 months since purchase and it's useless outside of as a streaming device.  Can't connect to cable, or Dvd player, no sound comes through.TV itself was fine while it was actually working, this is mostly about about the vague BestBuy, Amazon return dealio...",2

",24.Oct.19,Yes,"I'm not happy that my house is now bugged by the amazon corporation, but this TV sure is cheap (I got for $200).There is no way to use this TV as just a dumb TV. Amazon ads are built in. You can't just leave it on HDMI 1 and bypass the home screen. You have to scroll past whatever amazon wants you to see to select the input you want.The smart feature are pretty good however despite being intrusive. It's clearly got a powerful processor, it's got mouse emulation, PLEX runs smoothly.Massive input lag, no good for gaming.Edit: Input lag was not the TV's fault, I had a bad cable. Input lag is fine.",2

",5.Nov.19,Yes,The TV went completely black after 13 months of owning it. Just enough time to be out of the warranty window - and just enough time for me to have wasted money.

",6.Nov.19,Yes,"This tv is total and complete garbage. It lost the ability to stream within the first month. Yes, it is the TV, I correctly troubleshooted the issue. The vendor (BestBuy) does not stand behind the product. They will not repair or fix it, they will not troubleshoot or help with their low quality defective product. I do not like leaving negative reviews but I strongly suggest you not buy this product. It is junk. The picture quality is terrible but to be expected at the price. I do expect it to be able to stream Hulu and Netflix as it is the sole purpose for buying it. That feature went out about 30 days after I set it up.",0

",11.Nov.19,Yes,"This started out as a great TV and our family loved the ease of using Alexa with it. However, a little after one year, the TV began turning on regularly and then shortly the picture with streak ino vertical lines of Amazon customer service was only helpful initially, then passed us off to Toshiba. Since we had passed one year, the warranty wouldn't cover it anymore. It's frustrating that a TV that is in otherwise pristine condition can just stop working in this way. Our last LCD TV (a Samsung) lasted for 10 years and the only reason we upgraded was to get Alexa integration (which works pretty well overall, but was finicky at times). It's looking like we should have just bought a fire stick instead.",2
5,"Great value
  
",13.Nov.19,Yes,Love my new TV.  It's very easy to set up and use.  My only complaint is the volume which works amazingly well when streaming but not so much on Dish.  The setting changes by more than 5 which to me is a lot.,0
2,"Buyer beware!
  
",14.Nov.19,Yes,"Good price. What I do not like is this TV seems to have a mind of its own. I have two fire TVs the main problem is they both has a tendency to shut down on its own. The Alexa features don't always work. Picture quality is OK, but not the best.",1

",14.Nov.19,Yes,"This TV does not work!The remote sent with the product does not pair up to the TV.  There is only one button on the TV that only operates on off and input function, making it completely in usable with out the remote.The TV has an extremely long delay when turning on - nearly 5 minutes.I do not recommend this product.",2
3,"Good TV, flawed smart functionality
  
",17.Nov.19,Yes,"I bought two of these. They worked fine for several months until the problems with Wi-Fi and remote control started. Both TVs started acting up several weeks apart. They would not connect to Wi-Fi either the 2.4 or 5 gigahertz frequency or even ether net connected directly to a broadband modem. Also, they would not register the remote control. Attempt at pretty much every solution including Factory resets, debug mode, firmware updates via USB. Nothing worked. Ended up configuring both TVs to boot and default input to HDMI 1. I purchased 2 fire stick 4K effectively repurposing both TVs as regular non smart TVs. This work around has worked great to this day and both TVs are using the Fire TV sticks for smart functionality. Given the problems described I don't think these TV sets are a good purchase just too many problems.",0

The picture is ""pretty good"" in the sense that it doesn't look like a high-end sony but given the price point, I was mostly hoping for a reliable secondary TV for a family room. This has worked quite well for that purpose and I wouldn't hesitate to buy one again. The processing is fast and the Alexa integration is really nice to have.",1
1,"Run From All FIRE TVs!!
  
",25.Nov.19,Yes,"I've had our Toshiba Fire TV for awhile now.  I've had to call into customer service at least 4 times for different issues with it and up until now they've been able to resolve it.  Recently, their app recommendations have been awful.  I have a young daughter and only her and I use our amazon and fire stick account.The app EPIX is one that is pre-installed I'm guessing. It is recommending shows that are completely inappropriate! One of them is called ""Sex Life"" along with a few others.  The rep went through our watch history and found nothing that lined up with the show title, only family friendly shows.  At first she insisted it was because of us watching a similar title...FALSE.We tried deregistering and re-registering my amazon account several times to no avail.  She finally advised that she would forward my issue to the engineering team.  A few days later she called back and suggested we highlight the unwanted recommendation and hit the menu button so we could delete it.  It didn't give an option to remove it. She has now advised that she will forward this ""new info"" to engineering and they will call back.I'm completely unhappy with Fire TV.  They should have a home page/content that lines up with your settings.  Parental controls are in place and my daughter can't watch the title without entering a passcode but she still is able to view the titles/images that shouldn't be there in the first place.  At least netflix lets you ""thumbs down"" a title and it's removed immediately.Fire TV has a long way to go as far as customer customizations.  They can't compete at all in my opinion. Something as simple as removing a title from a recommendations list should be a given.I don't recommend this at all! At this point I'm ready to get rid of all Amazon products I have.  You can do better.",2

",27.Nov.19,Yes,"For the price, this is hard to beat.  The picture is great.  I was seeing the picture dim from time to time but I changed the picture from the custom setting I had changed it to one of the stick choices and it hasn't done it since and the picture still looks good.  It's no XBR, but it didn't cost that much either.  I use it for YouTube, Netflix, Disney+, Red Bull, and thats about it.  For Netflix and Disney the picture is flawless.  On YouTube I sometimes see some blocks in the bottom right of the screen that are green when that isn't the picture, but it doesn't bother me.  Seems like it is usually when the picture is not taking up the full screen and it is in a dark area.  Sound has been good.  I have it connected to a amp by the fiber connection and that works good.  If your on a budget this is a good option.",2
1,"Damaged before shipping
  
",27.Nov.19,Yes,"The 50"" TV screen was clearly damaged prior to shipment. The box was not damaged at all. The styrofoam packing showed no distress, but the screen was very clearly cracked and damaged. The TV would not work either. I plugged it in, turned it on, the screen blinked and went black. I think this fault is clearly on Best Buy and not Amazon.",1
2,"Great while they work
  
",28.Nov.19,Yes,"We bought 3 of these on release day and came high speed as expected. One was damaged and Best buy replaced it for me since it sold from them, no problem there. 14 months after purchase one of them stopped working, I contacted Toshiba and I was told too bad it's out of warranty, we were disappointed but not a huge deal they are a low cost TV. Unfortunately one of the others died this morning. I will attempt to contact Toshiba tomorrow since it Thanksgiving day but I don't hold out much hope on support, we are down to oneThey are pretty great picture quality and the fire software on board was pretty nice, just don't expect a long life.",2

",29.Nov.19,Yes,I have had a lot of trouble with this television.  When it's working it's great. But it will stop responding to the remote.

I have not been able to download the Spectrum TV App (to enable me to return the cable box and not pay monthly for it anymore).The steps are not intuitive, and the software restricts the Apps that you can access.I dislike the App interface.  We have a Samsung TV which is much much easier to use.",0

Now, it only turns the TV on and off, the rest of the buttons do not work (the Alexa command doesn't work either...). We can't use the TV because of this...If you try to buy an official replacement for this remote on Amazon, you can check that the comments confirm/match this review, so that proves that this remote fails after a few months for tons of people...Conclusion: If want a TV with remote, do not buy a Toshiba Fire TV.",1

The seller didn_ give us the option to exchange it...just to return it. I went to the actual Best Buy website to purchase a new one. The price wasn_ much more than the original we purchased...until...we went to check out and they wanted to charge $220 for shipping!!!! The nearest Best Buy is 3 hours away from where I live. Pretty ridiculous. I feel if you get a defective product You should have the option of a replacement. ESPECIALLY IF IT WAS PURCHASED ON BLACK FRIDAY! Ended up ordering a Vizio for quite a bit more,0

",8.Dec.19,Yes,"So far, on my second day of trying, I simply CANNOT get Alexa tp Pair with this TV. Instructions, YouTube Videos, Google directions all tell you to tap on things that do not exist, Toshiba Smart Center app (that one YouTube video says is necessary), only freezes on my iPhoneXr and says it failed to get whatever it needs from the TV.  I am ready to conclude that this TV is NOT Alexa compatible.I also have a computer connected to this TV.  Computer screen quality is so bad that I almost cannot  read the print. Other programs like SKETCHUP and MUSESCORE are so enlarged that they distort, making my 31"" iMac with Retina scan a picture from Heaven.

",9.Dec.19,Yes,"Works amazing so far (will update if needed aware of some picture issues over time), very loud and good sound quality compared to last tv. 4k HDR content such as the Grand Tour on Amazon is impressive coming from a 50in 1080p Sony. Only able to get 4k content at 30hz via PC on HDMI1 will update if changing the cable fixes problem. Smart features respond quickly just wish there was an easier transition from HDMI to smart functions besides going to settings and selecting HDMI 1 or pulling it up from your quick bar but only after you use it recently.",0
5,"Dang nice for the price
  
",10.Dec.19,Yes,"So, it was very inexpensive ($119), arrived quickly and very easy to set up. It did take me a second to realize you have to download certain apps ( like NETFLIX) but once I pulled my head,,, off the ground, It went smoothly ( PS according to my wife, and I strongly disagree, cursing at the TV does not get it to work).  Quality is better than expected for an inexpensive TV. OMG this sucker is light. REALLY light. I thought it was hollow inside. Watched a few TV shows last night and the sound is fine. Better than my other inexpensive TV. Oh, there is a ""L"" and a ""R"" on the legs along with a ""square peg round hole"" concept. (you will understand if you buy it). Long cord and easy remote. All the items on the back of the TV ( HDMI, power cord,,, etc) are angled away from the wall. So if you wanted to mount this flat on the wall it is an option.  Like most newer TVs there is NO buttons on the TV so please, do not misplace the remote or let Fluffy get a hold of it.",1

",11.Dec.19,Yes,"Kinda irritated. Probably sending back.  The remote comes with pre-printed (burned in to the plastic) buttons for services we don't have or want.  Manual says they can be assigned to other services, but doesn't say how.Also won't support streaming with one of the largest cable services in the USA.

They told me that is too big to take inside the store. The alternative was to have someone to come to my house. However, I live in the middle of Wisconsin so I wanted to know if they had agents available to come where I live. I was told I can only have that information if I paid 199 subscription annually. I only paid 189 for this TV so there's no in God's name that I'm going to pay 199 every year  and not even know if they can come to my house.The TV never synced well with my Bluetooth devices or my Echo.",0

",17.Dec.19,Yes,"I have needed to replace my bedroom television for quite some time, and finally went for it with this model. It has great clarity and picture quality, and watching some light television on it was great. But when I watched a sci-fi show with lots of low rumbling space noises, the audio was terrible. It rattled and reverberated, and was just terribly distracting - but I ordered an inexpensive sound bar to connect to the TV, and now I can enjoy high quality picture AND sound. While I would have preferred to not tack another $40 onto the cost of the television to make it perform its best, the whole thing was not too big a deal. I do love how slim and sleek the television is, so I think it's reasonable to assume that they made sacrifices on sound in order to make the display so compact. Ultimately, I recommend this television, as I found it very easy to set up and get going, and I'm really happy with the smart features and integration of all the apps I used regularly on my Roku or Apple TV.",1

",20.Dec.19,Yes,Size was important to me; this was perfect.  Simplicity for usage &amp; limitations of my technical status were adequate.  Would wish for a more detailed hard/soft cover manual.,0
5,"Excellent
  
",21.Dec.19,Yes,Excellent,0
5,"Great for the price.
  
",21.Dec.19,Yes,I bought this on the Sale price of $99.Dollars. It is well worth the money.  I would buy another one if I didn't suspect it from invading my privacy. You never know. I will learn more as time goes on.,0
5,"Great tv
  
",21.Dec.19,Yes,I like everything about this tv. The voice recognition is great.  The built in fire stick. Beautiful picture.,0
3,"Disappointed in the amount of apps
  
",22.Dec.19,Yes,"Unfortunately this television fire TV edition does not have access to all the Apps that a fire stick does. Not sure if this is an Amazon problem or a 3rd party software developer problem, but I was extremely disappointed that I can't run Plex on it which is one of the main reasons I selected this TV. Also it is not compatible with the Bose Soundtouch speakers I just purchased. Another huge disappointment. aside from those issues it works fine, though I recommend some type of compatible soundbar as the sound of the TV is a bit tinny. I can run Plex and Bose connect on this TV if I hook up a regular Fire Stick to the TV, but it's a bit redundant to have a fire stick hooked up to a Fire TV. lol",0
5,"100 stars!!
  
",24.Dec.19,Yes,It was delivered quickly and in perfect condition. I use it for the smart tv functions to watch youtube and netflix and prime videos at night. There have been no issues at all. I am really glad I found this. Super pleased with it.,0
4,"Excellent
  
",24.Dec.19,Yes,It's a 32 inch. So far it is great. Good picture. Could be a little brighter. Very happy.,0
1,"very dim screen
  
",24.Dec.19,Yes,Liked having fire TV. This was my first time using fir TV. The picture image though for some shows was so dim you could not see what was going on even at night when the room lighting was all off. Considering it was only 299.99 I guess you get what you pay for.,0
5,"It_ ultra HD 4K and sounds great
  
",24.Dec.19,Yes,You need internet and some apps only works in USA,0
1,"Forget about ever changing your setup or configuration
  
",25.Dec.19,Yes,"I bought this TV for my mother.  Initially it did not support several Amazon App store apps despite being ""FireTV"" certified.  So it was already a failure out of the gate.I then boxed this thing back up, was refused my return to Amazon/Best Buy (aka:""Best Lie"") so I tried to set it back up in a spare bedroom in another house.  When it powered up, it just shows error on the screen and the remote refuses to work or pair with the device.  There are NO CONTROLS on the TV itself except for one INPUT button to change input.  So if the remote doesnt work, you are done.  This is where I am now.  I have several other FireTV devices in my house and I could not get any of the remotes to pair with this TV and I have no way to control it without a paired remote.This is an expensive paperweight that they will not let me return so I am stuck with it.  I blame Toshiba and Amazon both for this failure.  This is easily the DUMBEST ""Smart"" device I have ever seen in my life.Take my advice and stay far away from this garbage.",1

5,"Awesome Purchase and Find___
  
",26.Dec.19,Yes,"I bought this TV for my 5 1/2 yr old son, hoping because of the Alexa feature on it that he'd be able to navigate the different apps.....Well, he loves it cause he gets to talk to his TV and I love it cause I didn't have to buy a game console for him to watch YouTube and Netflix and Disney Plus_ It's already on the TV! The picture and sound are great! First smart TV purchase for us and now I'll be investing in a couple more at tax time___ And it arrived on time like it said it would_",0
4,"Great product, I would recommend.
  
",26.Dec.19,Yes,"I gave this a 4 star rating and not 5 because  the screws for the legs of this item should be universal to those needed to put it on a wall mount. The products other qualities are great, which confused me as to why the choice to not include wall mount screws.",0
1,"it doesn't work as advertised
  
",26.Dec.19,Yes,"It worked during the 15 day return period, then Toshiba apparently broke it with a firmware upgrade. The ""last input"" no longer works as it's supposed to.Best Buy service was supposed to come by today. Never showed. I've been hung up on three times calling Toshiba support.My 93 year old Dad can't operate the inputs. I believe Amazon /Toshiba / Best Buy should fully refund this purchase since Toshiba broke it after the warranty period",0
5,"super easy install
  
",26.Dec.19,Yes,was a gift for my daughter and she is really pleased with it.  she is super excited about the disney+ that my visio needs a firestick to view. she loves that she now has a toshiba smart 4k instead of her emerson 32in hd.,0
5,"Next time indicate on the advert that a subscription is needed to watch the tv
  
",28.Dec.19,Yes,The features are all working but was very disappointed that I have to register with bank details to pay for channels. I already have a cable provider did not need to pay for other services,0

5,"Happy Granddaughter
  
",30.Dec.19,Yes,"I bought this for my Granddaughter for Christmas, it went straight to her so I was able to see it. I was on the phone wiht her while she was setting it up and she loved it and it was easy for her. I'm very happy with my purchase and Toshiba has always been a very good brand for us.",0
1,"Terrible Terrible Terrible!!!
  
",31.Dec.19,Yes,"Received 2 Smart TVs - one fine, the other completely broken screen.  Worst time EVER trying to send back damaged TV.  Amazon says it is on Best Buy and Best Buy REFUSING to accept return and refund me.  This has been going on SINCE JUNE 2018!  IT IS NOW 12/31/19!",0

5,"Works great
  
",4.Jan.20,Yes,"With my Fire stick, I get plenty of programming without cable or satellite.",0
4,"Great buy!
  
",5.Jan.20,Yes,I bought this on sale around black Friday and it was a great deal. I bought it because Netflix stopped supporting the Sony DVD players I had that had been Netflix compatible. The picture is not top notch but it is very close. Certainly more than adequate and well worth the price.,0
5,"Toshiba Alexa TV
  
",5.Jan.20,Yes,Nice setup and good price.,0
2,"Defective Remote
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,Came with a defective remote.Only solution is to return the entire TV or get myself a new remote.  No buttons on the TV so you NEED the remote.Bad customer service.,0
5,"Easy set up, love the picture quality.
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,I got this tv because my old one did not have a hdmi connection for my fire stick. I was able to get it set up without any problems and the picture quality is outstanding.,0
3,"Picture was NOT good enough for a long term commitment
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,I just returned the tv and when I was at Best Buy doing it another guy was standing in front of me returning the same tv. 10 years ago this would be a great tv but in today_ age the picture was just too blurry for me. I was watching golf and when they would putt you would see two balls next to each other. I_e been told that you need to spend at least $600 on this size to get a truly good picture,0
5,"It is a smart tv which I can watch Netflix and amazon prime
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,Nothing so far,0
5,"Comprenlo ya!!!!

5,"Nice TV for the price
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,The perfect economical TV for my guest room. Love the integrated features for Netflix and other apps. Putting the legs on was tricky for me because I am partially disabled but otherwise setup was easy.,0
1,"Wifi feature doesnt work!!
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,Very disappointed.  The TV worked for 2 days then disconnected from the internet and would not connect back up again. We have few more TVs in the house and all connect just fine. Definitely returning.,0
5,"Good product, good value
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,Very nice for use in a bedroom. Like everything about it.  However the only thing we can get Alexa to control is the on/off to the Amazon screen. Alexa won't control the regular channels. Good product for the money,0
5,"Amazing for the price
  
",8.Jan.20,Yes,Absolutely great products and love all the apps that are included a great TV for the price,0
5,"Big fan of the fire TV platform !

",8.Jan.20,Yes,Love the TV. The only thing that I don't like or the cheap legs that it stands on kind of flimsy for such a big TV,0

5,"Cyber Monday 2019
  
",9.Jan.20,Yes,It worth the price. Just wish I got a larger size screen.,0
5,"Everything I expected and more
  
",9.Jan.20,Yes,My only negative comment would be SOME of the picture quality is a little grainy at times but then i DID choose 720p instead of 1080p so that's to be expected. The other Smart features blow me away as this is my first Smart TV.,0
5,"Nice TV
  
",9.Jan.20,Yes,Purchased because it is one if few with head phone jack. Very happy with TV performance.,0
5,"Great tv
