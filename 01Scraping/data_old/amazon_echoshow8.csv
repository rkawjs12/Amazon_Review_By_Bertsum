",25.Nov.19,Yes,"I had the echo 5 and I can't stand the ""try Alexa"" phrases at the bottom. From all the reviews I read on the 5 I wasn't the only one. I hope Amazon realized that people didn't like this. I will be returning this. At least make it a option.",648

5,"So easy and so good with Ring cameras
  
",25.Nov.19,Yes,"I received my new Echo Show 8 - HD 8"" smart display with Alexa a couple hours ago. I had it unpacked and connected to my WIFI within 30 minutes. I have 3 Ring cameras, front door bell, a front &amp; back yard motion light cameras. Once I followed the steps to add Ring in the Alexa app, like 2 minutes, It was so intuitive I don't know what I did right but another 5 minutes I said Alexa show front door and she said okay and there was my front door camera on the screen. Then I said Alexa, show back which is what I named the devise ""back"" and she said okay and showed the back yard camera, same with the front successfully. I have many more smart devices the Alexa app found on my wi-fi so I'm excited to figure out how to add them.Also, now I understand the importance of naming the devices. Alexa only understands exactly what you name them in the devise list for voice commands.",365
5,"My favorite amazon device
  
",25.Nov.19,Yes,"I_ using this as my bedroom clock and replaced an old echo dot. I like how it has the sunrise feature which is also mention in the echo show 5. The screen goes dark once you turn off the lights, so you don_ have to worry about ambient light staying on. Sound quality is really good compared to an old full size echo. I plan on buying another one for my kitchen now.. Kind of hooked to having a screen now...",5
5,"It's a winner!
  
",25.Nov.19,Yes,"Over and over, in the ""most helpful"" reviews, I read about ""ads"" displaying. This does NOT ever display ads, it displays Alexa skills and things to try with your device. I read that people cannot get that to stop happening. It's right in the settings: go to: ---Home &amp; Clock--- then: ---Home Content--- then, turn off ---Discovery---, that will end the Alexa skills displaying (may cycle once after setting but then they're gone for good). I kept reading that people who want to use it as a clock were upset that the clock kept getting minimized (to left corner) to show other things. That's because, yet again, they aren't setting it up correctly. So, in the settings: go to: ---Home &amp; Clock--- then: ---Home Content--- then, turn off ---Rotate Continuously---, that will make the Home screen always display a full screen clock. You can also just turn off any content in that list. Note that each time you go into the settings, immediately after, it WILL show you a single skill or any content you left on. But that's it. It will just be a clock from then on, until you interact with it again and then it may display a single skill or that content. Once. Then back to being a full time clock.Full disclosure: I got this to use as an alarm clock and not as a primary viewing assistant. For that, I recommend the larger echo devices. I also got this on Prime Day for $50 (rather than $90). That's a screaming good deal for what is basically a voice activated, smart alarm clock with a lot of different options.Decent Alarm clocks run $30-50 anyways so I thought I'd give this device a try for $50. I should have bought 2. Even for $90, I feel like this is a great device but if you wait, it will eventually go on sale again. I don't intend to use it to watch TV shows or movies, I have TVs, tablets and PCs for that. I saw people mentioning being disappointed in the resolution or screen quality. I don't see the problem. This certainly isn't going to compare to your $300-800 smart phone screen but it's not bad looking when playing videos or displaying the clock. It's similar to say, an iPhone 3 or Galaxy S2. I feel like the people complaining are expecting ""the moon"" for the money this costs. It's $90. Not $150 or $200.There was alot of fairly bad reviews on the echo 5, but I wanted something bigger that I could use to see my ring doorbell video.  Setup was easy and got it running no problem.  Tried ""alexa show me the front door""... and nothing worked!!  No panic, went and pushed the ring doorbell and checked my phone, live video seen no problem.  OK, try Echo again ""alexa show my the front door""  Bingo!!  video displayed in about 3 sec's (i'd seen comments it was taking over 11 seconds) but that's not what I experienced.Next sound quality, tried a few songs... Wow I was not expecting much in the audio quality, but it was actually really good and as a side benefit, it displays the words of the song as it's sang, pretty cool.  Basically all the other alexa functions work as with any device, but now you also get video feedback. Ask about the weather,  get your info, plus it displays the  temp, clouds, sun, whatever...  Very happy with purchase and highly recommended!!","1,551"
4,"The Pros, Cons and Oks for the Echo Show 8 (HR).
  
",25.Nov.19,No,"Pros:__________ Very compact and simple design.  I like these designs because they can fit in all rooms. Bedroom, Kitchen, and the living room this echo can fit in any location. It has a large rubber foot that keeps it from shaking around. Big fan of the black mesh fabric that covers the back of the device. It doesn_ become a finger/dust print magnet. Extremely simple setup as you do the setup right on the screen (you don_ need to download any app). All you need is Wi-Fi and you_e basically done. You can set multiple alarms and have them repeat on various days of the week. Change the alarm tone, have the sound gradually increase to get you out of your sleep, and be able to play the music that you want. This a customized alarm system that fits anyone_ needs. To add more customization, you can make this device a picture frame. You can set a single pic or a slideshow of pics as your background. I love the privacy. To have a _hysical shutter, to block the camera, is an excellent choice. If I didn_ have this, I would, like every laptop, place some tape in order to block the viewing. It_ very quick to just slide on the shutter. In this day in age, you never know whose watching. It_ the little things, like these, that shows that Amazon knows what we want (sometimes). There is a button (next to the volume controls) on the device that will allow you to mute the mic. You can say to Alexa ""delete everything I said today"" to erase your recorded search history (The little things go a long way). Even when I block the camera shutter, I can still take calls or talk to Alexa. The light sensor goes into a nighttime display when the lights are off. Waking up at 3 to check the time was quick and painless to my eyes. The sensor is able to add the appropriate amount of light, depending on how much light is in the room. It_ similar to the auto-brightness we have on our smartphones. Has a built-in 3.5 mm audio cable which means you can plug this in your home speaker system. I didn_ find the need to test this out because it_ just plugging into another speaker. Two web browsing options, Firefox and Amazon Silk, but I recommend you stick with Firefox (Found it better in the use with this device). Like all voice commands, asking Alexa for the weather, make a call, play music, turn on a light (a smart light), and so forth does its job, most of the time (will go into details in the Con section). Software-wise, I do appreciate that on the screen, if you hit the smart home button, organizes what devices you use frequently. I found this very useful to see what smart devices I use the most (what a shocker that it was the smart lights in my house.) It is useful if you need to quickly turn a specific smart device off. If you have a thermostat smart device, one cool feature is changing the temperature with the Show 8. I ask Alexa to change the temperature of my thermostat and a slider pops up on the screen, allowing me too automatically to tweak the temperature further. There is also a button, on the device menu, to turn off everything connected to the Show. The voice calls come through the Alexa app or through Skype. Does have Bluetooth. As Sheldon Cooper wisely once said, _verything is better with Bluetooth._ The microphone picks up my voice very quickly. This is having the TV on average person volume level and, probably, 20 feet away. The screen is actually viewable. Having seen the Echo 5 in the past, The Show 8 screen is a huge improvement in viewing videos or getting a glance for quick info (weather, news highlights, time, etc.). With smart screen layout, I can see this fit for security cams and baby monitors. I have a Ring camera on my door, and this works like a charm if I need to see who at the door. Saying _lexa, start my day. Is a pretty cool experience if you spend the time customizing what you want to see and hear, from Alexa, when getting out of bed, You can have a very modern morning cycle. Taking and receiving phone calls is a real breeze. I here no static or break in communication when talking to my colleague. Note that I didn_ try WIFI calling international. To summarize, you have 4 ways of communication: Message, Call, Drop-In, and Announce. When playing Foo Fighters, the Show 8 does display the lyric alongside the song it_ playing, _he Pretenders. One word for this, Karaoke! Good speakers for music coming in the Show 5. It_ loud, which was a little surprising, given the size. Not enough for a house party, but enough for study or cooking time.Cons and Oks:__________ You can_ watch YouTube videos by using Alexa_ voice command. You have to physically go and type it in the web browser. Google owns YouTube and as of 2019, Amazon and Google are not the best in merging software. A major buzzkill because learning how to do something is what YouTube is made for. Instead of YouTube, Alexa will bring you to Wiki videos. They_e very basic, not a significant amount in video inventory, and I was only able to access the intro videos. I wanted to know how to bake cookies and I needed to go to the screen and touch the next video for it to play. Wiki videos don_ give you the opportunity to cook _inging with Babish videos. Beware of the advertisement for watching movies and shows. Amazon loves cutting 30% of the screen with advertisements. You need to be prepared for this experience because this is not going away. Unlike Google_ Nest Hub, when you speak to Alexa, the device will not show you what you said. Alexa has messed up in what I said, yet I don_ know which word that caused the miscommunication. I want to mention this again, NO SUPPORT FOR ANY GOOGLE SERVICES. To be honest, Google owns the internet (Photos, Drives, Nest Cameras, YouTube, etc.) and with this device, all the basic searches/videos you want require additional steps. Want mapping directions to go to a place around your city? Stick to google maps on your smartphone because Alexa doesn_ do this. The camera isn_ anything to brag about. It doesn_ have any advance HDR features, but then again it_ only for video calls. Web typing on this is miserable. I just stick to my phone if I need to search for something really quick. The bezel around the screen makes everything look smaller than it is. Its screen size does help reduce the feeling. No real apps are useful, given the size. Alexa is no Google Assistant. You have to speak in a specific syntax in order for Alexa to do what you want it to do. With simple demands, Alexa works like a charm. It_ when you start asking random questions that Alexa will say _orry, I_ not sure about that, or something similar. Example: I said ""Alexa, show me dog videos"" and nothing happens but saying _lexa, open Prime Video, it opens right away. Very specific on what you need to say. No USB port to charge your phone. This Show, to me, is more for public viewing, the center of attention. A USB port would_e been great not only to charge your phone, but to input pictures, videos, and even recipes into the Show. When you start getting used to the Show 8, turn off Alexa tips. Having that feature on will clutter the screen by default. You have a small screen and yet the Show 8 wants to put as much as it can on it. When streaming music from my iPhone to the Show 8 (using Bluetooth) the music isn_ clear as it_ plagued with Bluetooth artifacts. I have to assume this is a software issue, so it may be resolved in the near future updates. Still, I think you should know. There is some lag on the touch screen. Tapping on a back button I have to wait 2-3 seconds before it follows with my request. Want to move it around, you need to pay for the viewing angle attachment because you can_ adjust viewing angles without it. The screen maybe a little too bright when it_ dark in the room. The Show 8 doesn_ have any Dolby features, which makes the volume for music loud, but not clear. Playing acoustic songs are fine but playing anything other complex songs (Foo Fighters, Lady Gaga) distorts the quality of the song. There are a lot of steps to just do a simple task. I wanted to pick my preferred source images and had to go through Settings, Home &amp; Clock, Clock, and finally to Personal Photos. A lot of steps for such a simple task.Bottom Line:__________Of the Echo Show and Echo Show 5, this is the best one out on the market. The two things that make this the best between the three is the screen and the privacy layout. The screen is large enough that watching videos wasn_ a hazel, and the manual buttons for privacy are a must in this day in age. It_ a very nice design and I see this as something you will have in the kitchen of all places.The Show 8 does a lot of decent work, but it also has numerous other features that it isn_ the best at due to software issues. The resolution isn_ mind-blowing, as it_ something to either play music, or even a movie, in the background while you work. This is no replacement for a screen to watch for 2 hours as it_ more for a quick 5 minutes here and there. This is why I see this for the kitchen as it_ a great place to follow cooking videos. Anywhere else I feel it would not be put into use enough to be worth the cost.Also, I advise everyone to take a look at the Google Nest Hub, Lenovo and the rest of the Echo Show smart system. The truth is, for a universal home smart system, this isn_ it. The Google Nest_ software is top of the line in communication and user interface. The Show 8_ main highlights are privacy, video calls, smart house function, and the price. With the price you_e getting it_ a nice system to screen ratio, but if you_e not fully on board in the Amazon world you_l be restricted in so many ways that sometimes it_l be quicker to just take out your smartphone.Overall: The best of the three Echo_, but most useful in the kitchen or at your desk.",86
5,"For the whole family
  
",25.Nov.19,Yes,"Set it up today. It set itself up in mins. Music sounds great. 9th echo device in our home. Setup a device group and play music everywhere. Works great with ring as well since we have no peephole in the door.  Made a custom album on Amazon photos, added as wallpaper. Placed it kitchen.",21
5,"Perfect in the kitchen!
  
",25.Nov.19,Yes,"We keep the Amazon Show 8 in our kitchen, and the whole family enjoys using it. Display is perfect size on the kitchen counter. We enjoy playing music (sounds great) and of course, we enjoy asking Alexa for the temperature or the weather forecast, and asking basically any question you can think of. Recipe feature is excellent too!",153
1,"Alexa, I don't want any ""Things to Try""
  
",26.Nov.19,Yes,"Aaaaaaaggghhh!  The ""Things to Try"" sayings are sooooooooo annoying.  And they are so stupid and do not pertain to me at all.  ""Alexa, how do you say hello in German?"", ""Alexa, rap for me."", ""Alexa, how hot is the sun?"", ""Alexa, what's the temperature on the North Pole?"", blah, blah, blah.  They constantly scroll overtop of the pictures  and photos that you upload to the home screen and wallpaper, making them really hard to ignore.  And the clock is so small in the upper left corner, that you have to be right on top of it to read it.  I couldn't take it any more and had to return my new Echo Show 8.",596
5,"Be sure to visit Settings for a better Echo 8 experience
  
",26.Nov.19,Yes,"Although I get frustrated with Alexa (a lot), this Echo Show 8 has been a treat so far compared to the Echo and the Echo Dot. And I haven_ even used it for cooking yet, which is why I got it. It_ just immeasurably better to have a screen.At first I was overwhelmed by what seemed to be random *stuff appearing all over the home screen, but when I went to Settings&gt;Home Content and turned most of the options off, now Home is just a picture and a small clock with the current temperature underneath it. Much better!Edited to add: if I interact with Alexa (i.e., ask for weather) afterwards I am getting a _ry Alexa suggestion, so I can understand where if you_e doing a lot with the device, that could become an annoyance.The sound quality impressed both my husband and me for the most part. (Maybe we_e just not very discerning in that regard.)Anyway, I like it a lot. Oh, I almost forgot to mention that I really appreciate being able to turn off the camera, too.P.S. It would be nice to be able to customize the clock face; that_ one thing I was disappointed by.",81
4,"Good product
  
",26.Nov.19,Yes,Good product,1
3,"Software makes it close to useless
  
",26.Nov.19,Yes,"I bought this to take the spot of my Show 5 in my bedroom.  With the Show 5 I could barely read the clock face across the room and there is no option to make the clock take up the entire screen.I figured 3 extra inches from the Show 8 would make the clock big enough to see.  Imagine my surprise when I found it is impossible to customize the clock face in Show 8 settings.  The closest I came to what I need is a dark screen with a tiny clock in the bottom left corner.  What is the point in that?There seems to be only one use case considered by Amazon, the user is right in front of the device.  If you see a positive review of this device, it's because the reviewer is using it in the kitchen or on their desk.  There is no consideration given for the across the room experience outside this being a photo frame.I sincerely hope Amazon gets their head out of their rear ends with this one.  I really feel like returning it.That said, hardware seems pretty nice.  It's just a bit ruined by the lack of customization and product vision on the software side.And for goodness sake, let people turn of ""Try this"" suggestions...",12
5,"Scaled down version of the show 2, but a bargain
  
",26.Nov.19,Yes,"I have a bunch of Echo devices in my home. Including the Echo show  2 10 inch.I feel like this is the best bargain at current prices.Sure you are getting 20 percent smaller in terms of screen size. But the difference is not too crazy.The screen resolution is almost the same. It looks very good.The sound is very solid in the echo show 8.I think the 8 is a compressed version on the 10 inch version. But that doesn't mean it's not good.Overall, I would definitely consider getting this over the 10 inch model. The price difference justifies it.",285
4,"Echo Show 8: Good But Not Quite as Good as the Echo Show 5
  
",26.Nov.19,Yes,"I have had an Echo Show 5 for over a month in my work office and like it a great deal. I ESPECIALLY like the ability to customize the clock.I received the new Echo Show 8 as a gift this past weekend and like it for most of the same reasons I like the Echo Show 5: great connectivity; good diversity of content and skills; and great as a sound speaker and photo display.But I found that the ES8 does not have the same options for clock faces as the ES5. There is no apparent reason for this, nor is it highlighted in the marketing for the ES8. Amazon, please update the ES8 software to permit at least the same range of clockfaces as the ES5.",613
5,"Great sound and screen is very easy to read
  
",26.Nov.19,Yes,"I have several Show 5's and am really excited about this 8"" model.  I have put mine in the living room and it makes a huge improvement in sound/music playing (as compared to the 5 which I already thought was really good) .  I had read it uses the same speakers as the larger Show 10 model.  I also have several of the Ring cams which are easily view able.  Another must have device from Amazon added to my home.",11
4,"Echo Show 8
  
",26.Nov.19,Yes,I like everything about this except for two things. You need the option to make the clock bigger if needed and be able to see the day's date.  Hopefully they will fix this in an update and if they do it would be a 5 star rating for me.,15
1,"Backlight Bleeding.
  
",26.Nov.19,Yes,"I love the way I can control Home Automation with Alexa. Was so excited to get the echo show 8, as my first echo screen unit. But as soon I powered it on, first thing I can see is the backlight bleeding so much. Is this normal to have that much, or did I got a bad unit? Anyway I thought it would be ok as you can see much when there is a brighter picture in it. But when it got inactive, I_l have only a clock and a black screen full with backlight bleed. Will contact Amazon and see if it_ normal or if I can get a replacement.__dit: Amazon it_ awesome, and it_ sending me a replacement. Will post back once the new unit arrives.__dit: added a picture for comparison. Second unit looks really good. Thank you.",104
2,"Great, but for one fatal flaw
  
",26.Nov.19,Yes,"I really do enjoy this device and am impressed at the abilities of Alexa. That said, until they add the option to disable the _ry Alexa suggestions on the bottom of the home screen I can_ recommend it and will not be buying addition units.Looking online I am far from the only person driven crazy by this so I hope Amazon listens to the feedback and makes this possible in a future update.EDIT: The current top review claims that I (and everyone else complaining about this) am wrong and this can be disabled. While this person is right in the fact you can customize a lot of the display, the _ry suggestions at the bottom are not one of them. For the record I contacted Amazon support before posting my review to confirm this. Anyone who says otherwise is simply wrong.",876
2,"No instructions?
  
",26.Nov.19,Yes,"I think it needs better instructions.  It is probably awesome if you know how to use it, but we have no idea how to use this, or what it's capable of.",5
5,"Solid device, exceeds expectations
  
",26.Nov.19,Yes,"I was expecting the screen size to be a bit too small but it's a good size.  HD screen is nice with crisp images and pictures.  Sound quality is pretty good too.  People complain about ""try Alexa"" on the home screen but there are a lot of customization options for what to show on the home screen - including the ability to turn those suggestions off.  Very happy with my purchase and will most likely be picking a few more up as Christmas gifts!",8
4,"Great addition to my kitchen
  
",26.Nov.19,Yes,Love it! Wish they had a full screen digital clock.,7
5,"Super fun
  
",26.Nov.19,Yes,My husband got me this as a early Christmas gift he loved it so much and was like she might just buy this herself lol I do love it. The sounds are great it looks up everything so far and reminds me to have a great day.,1
5,"My son loves it.
  
",26.Nov.19,Yes,"My son loves the 8 inch Amazon Show.My wife has the the 5 inch show in our bedroom.I have the 10 inch show in my home office.Needi I say more we love the Amazon Show for sure.I was surprise on how good the 8 inch show sound was, great price.The only problem I have we need more names for our units, and maybe we can name our units ourselves.I also have 4 Echo Dots and one car unit.",17
4,"Very good addition, but needs option for Big Clock
  
",26.Nov.19,Yes,"Replaced my Echo Spot with the Show 8.  Very nice screen resolution and easy to use.  I like the streaming video available as well as the standard Echo features.  My one disappointment is the lack of ability to change the clock look.  I should be able to have a large clock display over most of the screen or other cool features, but right now only a small display in one corner.  Hopefully this will be resolved in a future update.",40
3,"Needs Work.
  
",26.Nov.19,Yes,"There are many things I like about this. However, 1 major thing is such a significant drawback that I feel weighs all the otherwise positive aspects out. That is, the constant, _ry Alexa,........ at the bottom of the home screen. It cant be turned off and it incredibly annoying.  It also seems to be something that has been around for past generations and I am absolutely baffled as to why.",15
5,"What a sound! Impressed!!!
  
",26.Nov.19,Yes,"WHOA!!! The sound is so deep and crisp!!! With the type of music I listen too, indie pop, the Echo Show compliments the music so nicely! I_ not fussy when it comes to technology and this is worth it on all levels of experience and usability!! Simple, great sound, connected well with my Bluetooth... easy to set up, Bing bang boom, DONE!!",1
5,"Works exactly as advertised
  
",26.Nov.19,Yes,Works excellent with our Ring doorbell. Screen resolution is beautiful. One of our favorite purchases,3
5,"A big improvement over the Show 5
  
",27.Nov.19,Yes,"All good so far.  I have the Show 5 and this is much better.  Better screen resolution, better speakers and obviously a larger screen.Like many others, I'm still not happy being unable to completely turn off the ""Try, Alexa..."" annoying banner at the bottom but it doesn't appear as often now as it does with the Show 5.  Mine is mostly just a large digital clock with a photo background, with the banner missing most of the time.I like it so much I'm getting a second one.",5
5,"The best echo device!
  
",27.Nov.19,Yes,"Great device. I am glad I waited for the 8 inch. Definitely worth it. If you can still get it for under $100, get one before prices go back up.  I like being able to see my Ring cam, listen to radio stations, Alexa even plays games.. so far my favorite is guessing the song..I tried 90s, 2000s, and 2010s. You can play with another so as well.  It_ like having a tablet without running on battery and a great loud speaker already attached. Only thing she can_ do is make me a ham sandwich lol.",7
5,"Our 35r Alexa device and very pleased
  
",27.Nov.19,Yes,"Have an Echo Dot and a Yamaha sound system with built-n Alexa, but our new Echo Show is really slick and our hands-down favorite.  Sharp color display and good sound quality. The 8"" display is just right size for an average size room - big enough to see easily without taking up too much space.  We've also just added a video security camera and the SHOW is excellent for real time display or stored video playback.",11
5,"UPDATE: AMAZON helped me fix my problem with great service!
  
",27.Nov.19,Yes,"My original review is below, but it turns out that I needed to change the wake word for the Echo Show. Amazon resolved this issue within an hour of my complaint. Now I am very happy with the Echo Show 8!ORIGINAL INCORRECT REVIEW: My new Echo Show 8 is 2 feet from me. My Echo Dot is in a room 15 feet away. About half the time, the Echo Show indicates that it is hearing my command, but the Dot in the other room responds to it. Makes it annoyingly useless to me. Also, it won't respond to commands to stop playing music, again probably a microphone issue. Will probably be returning it.",5
5,"Discount (updated)
  
",27.Nov.19,Yes,"Not very cool, offer a pre-sale for $30 off and a week later reduce it another $20, not nice at allUpdate, changing from 1 star to 5. Amazon did me right, totally unexpected. Thanks Amazon",27

",27.Nov.19,Yes,Received today 5 minutes later linked to WiFi and Alexa love this thing would give it 6 stars if I could,4
5,"Perfect Echo Show - size and quality
  
",27.Nov.19,Yes,"This Echo Show is a winner.  I have a LOT of Echo Shows around my house (various models) and I like this the best.  The screen is much better quality (and larger) than the Echo Show 5 and larger screen than the first generation Echo Show.  The design takes up less room than the earlier Echo Show models and looks better too.  If you buy a stand for it, get the one from EchoGear (shown in my photos).  It works great and tilts up and down and swivels.  The screen looks great (HD) and sound is excellent.  I like the switch on the top to turn off the camera and microphone (like the Echo Show 5).",470
5,"A Great Addition to Your Home Tech
  
",27.Nov.19,Yes,"This is my first Echo device.  Had already set up several skills on the Alexa app before the Echo Show 8 arrived, so I was ready for it; and had my expectations already set as to the quality of the response to the voice commands.  If you are considering entering the Echo 'echo-system' and are on the fence about getting one of these, try downloading the Alexa app to your phone or tablet and try it out.  On the phone app (iPhone and iPad in my case), a button push activates Alexa; with the Show 8, just say her name and she starts listening.Some of the Alexa skills still need some work, and your satisfaction with them may vary.  But for the Show 8, it's great!  The speakers sound better than  I expected (actually are pretty awesome compared to the Show's size) and will fill the room with sound.  The Show 8 has an external speaker jack on the back, but I don't see ever using it - the internal speakers are THAT good - can feel the bass from the speakers vibrating the kitchen countertop.  With the speakers in the rear, having it backed up close to a wall provides the best sound projection and quality.  A similar concept to some higher end Bose speakers, which have rear-firing elements that are designed to reflect the sound off of a wall and provide more ambience.When music is played, the lyrics scroll on the screen, so you can sing along (if your housemates and dog can stand it).  Even when playing at a higher volume level, I can still get Alexa's attention but it may take more than one attempt.  The microphones are quite sensitive and will pick me up from another room as long as there is not much background noise.  The Show 8 also has Bluetooth, so you can pair it with a phone, laptop or other device and play music through the Show 8's speakers.  I do this frequently since the Show 8's speakers sound much better than the internal phone or laptop speakers.  I did notice a bit of a delay in watching a video on the laptop, and then the audio coming out of the Show 8.  It just may be an artifact of using Bluetooth to send the audio.Rather than the recommended stand (or no stand), I purchased the ""Echo Show 8 Adjustable Aluminum Swivel Stand"" also sold on Amazon (you can see my review of the stand on that page).  A stand is recommended to allow you to position the Show 8 at an optimum viewing angle.I also purchased several of the Meross Wifi smart plugs (also sold on Amazon).  Have them programmed to link with Alexa so I can give one command (such as ""Alexa, turn on Christmas Lights"") and ALL the plugs in the Christmas group turn on at the same time.  Pretty cool!  Once Christmas is over, the plugs will be assigned other duties.The Show 8 can browse the web.  There is a Firefox skill that will allow you to open a web browser.  And if you don't like tapping letters on the screen, you can pair a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse (see photo).  If you have an HP printer, it can be linked to the Show 8 to print grocery lists or stuff you find on the internet.Not a deal-killer for me, but can't seem to be able to disable the ""Try Alexa &lt;blah blah blah&gt;"" on the bottom of the home screen.  You CAN disable the skills cycling with other topics in the center of the screen as another reviewer noted.  I have the Show 8 in my kitchen; so the display is not ""in my face"" and I am not looking at it all the time, so it is not THAT big of a deal.Have to admit I was skeptical and wasn't sure if I would find it useful....but I'm liking this device more every day.  Now an Echo Dot has found its place in our household as well.  Along with some Echo Buttons....Like the Echo Show 8 so much that I ordered another one to give to my daughter and son-in-law!",158
2,"alexa, quit showing me suggestions!!!!!!!
  
",27.Nov.19,Yes,"Update - There are reviewers out there who claim you can turn off the suggestions.  When I first go the device I went to the ""Home and Clock"" settings, turned EVERYTHING off, and I still get the alexa suggestions all the time.  One person also claims to have a full-screen clock displayed.  When my review was posted, I received a phone call from an amazon support person, and he agreed there is NO way to turn off the alexa suggestions and he also agreed there is NO way to display a full-screen clock.-------------------------------------------------------------I have the show5 and I really like it.  I have turned off the notifications but I still get the annoying alexa suggestions at the bottom of the screen.  On the show5, at least the alexa suggestions are in small print and I can pretend they are not there as I enjoy my large clock.  On the show8, all you get is a small clock in the upper left corner - no way to change it and since the screen is bigger, the mandatory alexa suggestions are in bigger font.  The good news - it was up and running in about 2 minutes and amazon music sounds good on it.  The bad news is, do I really want to keep it?  I really like the large clock face on the show5 and it seems ridiculous I have NO clock options on the show8.",48
3,"Not as customizable as the Echo Show 5
  
",27.Nov.19,Yes,"While I was looking forward to a bigger screen to be seen further away, I was disappointed in a few things in comparison to the Echo Show 5.  It does have a bigger screen, however, the clock face is not as customizable as the 5.  Also, most of the time while on the home screen only shows the time, appearing to have no option to show the weather and date all the time such as the Show 5 does.  The sound is the same as the 5, the screen is bigger, but otherwise disappointed in the features of the Echo Show 8.",5
5,"easy setup
  
",28.Nov.19,Yes,"easy to use, Amazon is awesome",5

",28.Nov.19,Yes,"Has the standard Alexa/Show functionality - as you would expect - and they work fine.BUT:- The screen continues to rotate thru  Echo ""Try ..."" prompts ,even with all settings disabled. Terribly annoying.- Was hoping to make this a big Clock - like you can with the Show 5 - NOPE.  - The clock has fewer options  - The clock digits are actually smaller than the Show 5.End of the day, if you just want this to be a clock, you end up with a smallish clock in the upper left corner of the display and continually rotating ""Try ..."" prompts at the screen bottom. Big dissapointment.",41
1,"Alexa keeps saying _omething went wrong
  
",28.Nov.19,Yes,"I am so disappointed in my Echo Show 8. Setup went really well. I have extremely fast internet. In the middle of her introduction to the features of The Echo Show 8, Alexa starting speaking in a loop and couldn_ answer any questions or execute any commands. After over an hour with Tech Support, Alexa is still unresponsive. Boo! Hiss!  Not a good introduction to the Echo Show 8.UPDATE: if your Echo Show 8 has the problem I described above, unplug it and let it sit for a few hours. I tried this and when I plugged it back in, Alexa was able to work as she is supposed to. Frustrating at first but turned out okay.",20
2,"Disappointing
  
",28.Nov.19,Yes,"I have the Show 5 as my bedside clock. I also have horrible vision. I bought this thinking I could have a larger clock than I do on the 5, but nope. The option to make it a big clock and fill up almost the entire screen, as you are able to do on the 5, is not an option on this. Disappointing, to say the least.",26
5,"Always wait for Black Friday!!
  
",28.Nov.19,Yes,I love my Echo Show 8! I should have waited a couple more days to order and I would have saved $20. Amazon doesn't do price adjustments on deal prices so always wait.,9
1,"""Things to Try"" makes this a product I can't recommend
  
",28.Nov.19,Yes,"I wrongly assumed that this new improved Echo Show would offer a way to turn off the absolutely annoying ""Things to Try.""  I was wrong.  Until they come up with a way of turning it off, I can't give a good review to this product or to any other Echo with a screen (Show, Spot).  I would put an Echo Show 8 in every room if they would allow me to kill the Things to Try.",93
2,"Software issues &amp; needs more options !!
  
",28.Nov.19,Yes,"Just received my Echo Show 8, set up was basically the same as an Echo Show 5, however, there is differences when it comes to the menu and options, I liked the addition of optional photos to chose from but the option to have the day/date on the screen is gone, who would do that, also there is no options for making the time fonts bigger/smaller.  Would be nice also if you could change the font colors. The speed at which the pictures rotate is much to fast, at least for me, maybe more options would be nice like an hour or 2-3-4 or even as long as a day, have a different picture every morning.  The size is nice but without being able to enlarge the fonts .. well .. would be nice for people that can't see real well. Overall I like it but needs some fine tuning as far as options especially for the price.  Another thing is I really don't need Alexa telling me to try and do things all day long I mean come on, how about an opt out button.Update;  12/12/2019I had two brand new Echo Show 5's that got sent back for fixing after dealing/chatting with Amazon customer service several times over a two week period because picture rotation would freeze along with a couple other glitches that occurred now and then and got sent back two refurbished/renewed Show 5's, my point here is that my brand new Echo Show 8 is doing the exact same thing, so instead of going through the whole customer service fiasco again I'm just returning it while I still can and not getting another one.  Another thing I noticed that I disliked after using it for a few days was when you set a timer the numbers are nice and big with a count down, but after just a couple seconds the timer shrinks down to where you'd have to be inches away to read it.Maybe, just maybe when gen-2 Echo 8 comes out I may revisit it, but they need to make some major changes.",44
3,"diffrent software than the ES5
  
",28.Nov.19,Yes,"The ES8 is a nice unit but it would be nice if Amazon could make it possible to get rid of the Try Alexa ----on the bottom. One reviewer said to go to home and clock then home content and then turn off Discovery. That's not quite correct for the ES8, that is how you get rid of the Try Alexa on ES5 not the 8. There is no Home and Clock, the 8 has a wallpaper and clock and right below that is the home content where you find discovery, and you can turn it off until you turn blue in the face, it will not cancel the Try Alexa. Maybe I have a different ES8 or Amazon posted the review for the wrong Echo Show. The second difference from the es5 is the clock. You have one setting. Overall the ES8 is a nice unit, just wish Amazons software department would have kept some of the features the 5 has. I'm just hoping they can send out some updates to fix these glitches.",9
4,"echo show 8
  
",29.Nov.19,Yes,"as a bedroom clock and music is very good,but i do agree with alot of reviews that state the home screen is really off the chain with the ads for alexa..""alexa tell me a joke"" or ""alexa sing happy birthday""...stuff like that or a list of commands should be sent with  the unit and user should be able to""disable"" that and only see the home screen.and im sure lots of people will agree that purchasing other things to control the tv,locks,ect from alexa should be built in and not an option to buy hubs,plugs ect. but my rating for the #8 show is good..but can use some updates and not just maintanance updates.",3
2,"Product development managers, what are you thinking?
  
",29.Nov.19,Yes,"Cannot make clock numbers larger. And cannot turn off the ""Ask Alexa"" suggestions rotating at bottom of home screen. Can't add personal email address. Did they not run this by a few focus groups? Their Product Managers must be idiots. RETURNING IT!",1
1,"No full screen clock mode
  
",29.Nov.19,Yes,GIVE US A FULL SCREEN CLOCK.  Why oh why Amazon does not provide the same clock options as a Show 5 or Spot does for the Show 8 baffles my mind.  1 star until that is fixed.,66
5,"Not Just A Glorified Alarm Clock...
  
",29.Nov.19,Yes,"I have been reading the Amazon Echo 5 reviews for quite sone time and trying to make up my mind on if I should buy it or not.  When I saw the pre-order starting for Echo Show 8 I was not sure if I was going to get it or not but I put my name on the list anyway.  Before the Echo Show arrived I planned on it just basically being a clock for me but I was wrong!  I had every plan of holding onto my alarm clock even after I set up the Echo Show in my apartment but it did not work out that way.  I saw the _kill for this speaker to play my Apple Music so that was the first thing that I tried because I wanted to see if it had good speaker quality like my Wonderboom blue tooth speaker which is my usual way of listening to my playlists.  It exceeded my expectations and since I set it up I have not turned on my Wonderboom speaker at all which is amazing to me because I like quality sound.  Even stopping the music for a few minutes is easily done with a voice command.  I am, and have been a longtime fan of everything Apple.  I do have an Amazon Kindle Fire but thought that would be it for me with Amazon_ devices.  I thought that I would have as much of a _roblem as quite a few others had with the things that come across  the Echo_ screen but to my surprise it is not bothersome at all to me.  I have long liked Apple_ customer service and when I purchased my smart tv and my sound bar I saw that one of the services Amazon provided was customer support.  My friend had set up the tv and the soundbar for me and he relied heavily on this service that Amazon provided in setting it up with the soundbar.  While I was confident that I would not need to use this service when I set up the Echo Show I figured that it would be fairly easy but was happy that if a problem arises and I cannot figure it out that I could always call and find an answer from Amazon.  I saw that on Black Friday (today) that the selling price is lower than I bought it for ($99) but that was to be expected.  I just decided that I would write a review on this product since it seemed ironic to me that I chose Amazon over Apple in this type of device.  I was seriously thinking I would stay with my plan of buying the Apple Home Pod because of the critical reviews of _ds on the Show but I see I am wrong with that.  Since I have set this unit up I see that it has surpassed my expectations because it is a great product that not only has great sound, it also has good clarity on the screen.  The only problem I have encountered with the Echo Show, and it is not much of  a problem, is to remember to say Alexa instead of Siri.  Since I have only a small efficiency apartment (400 square feet) I do not need another Echo Show but if I did I would not hesitate to purchase another one of these units.  For me to write something like this for an Amazon product it is a pleasant surprise because I myself rely heavily on all reviews because they are very valuable in deciding what to purchase since I am on a small fixed income and I figured there are so many reviews of the Echo Show that I wouldn_ have to bother with that but I changed my mind after seeing this is a wonderful product.  Thank you Amazon for giving such good quality for such a small purchase!  I would not hesitate to even buy one as a present for somebody if they wanted something like this.UPDATE-I decided to call customer service since I was not happy with seeing the selling price go from $129.99 to $99 and now to $79.  I usually never call for things like this but I was very happy with the agent telling me that I will get a promotional discount which is very good for me since I am on a very small fixed income.  Thank you Amazon your customer service is always good!",0
2,"Needs better apps
  
",29.Nov.19,Yes,I like the new model. It's got a nice screen and sound.It's crazy that we still cant access things like pinterest or do a basic web search even.I ideally want to be able to get to recipies I want and not just allrecipies.com which are the only recipes you can search.,8
4,"MAKE THE AMBIENT CLOCK BIGGER!!
  
",29.Nov.19,Yes,"I love the Echo Show 8. The only thing I hate the most is the SMALL DIGITAL CLOCK!! Why would you put such a small clock on a bigger screen! When the Echo Show 8 goes into ambient mode the clock is in the corner!! Lol. I hope you update this to a BIGGER CLOCK!! If not I'll send it back and be happy with the Echo show 5. Sound is great! Picks up my voice better than the show 5. I'm using an extra stand from my show 5 and I don't know if I'll need a stand right now. Please stop displaying ask Alexa this or try this on my screen. I don't want to see that stuff! Should be able to just display things I want to see!! It works great with my Wyze Cameras and all my WiFi lights. The sound is really really good!! Way better than the Echo Show 5. I can't stand the clock is so small! I had friends looking in the manual and online for a way to make that clock biggie! I hope I mentioned the ambient clock enough, so it gets stuck in your head's!! PLEASE UPDATE THE AMBIENT CLOCK! I wish I can change the color of the clock. I have until January 31 to return it. Get moving on some updates!",24
4,"Almost perfect, but needs a couple of small tweaks
  
",29.Nov.19,Yes,"I really like this unit, and like one of the previous reviewer_ has mentioned you can definitely do away with most of the Alexa suggestions by diving into the settings.There is one thing I wish they would do differently. On the echo five, there is a set of very attractive clock faces that can be chosen, but on this unit you can only choose a category such as art, travel etc. The echo will then choose random clock faces from that category to display. I would very much prefer having the ability to choose a clock face and stay on that one as opposed to having the unit choose various faces for me. For example on the echo show five there is an attractive nature scene with a lot of greenery and I would love to be able to put that same picture on the echo eight, but it_ unavailable.Additionally, we need a full screen clock option. Having a huge screen and relegating the clock to a small corner is not going to work for many of us.Other than these missing options it_ a winner, and I hope they will change the software soon to be able to allow for better clock face and display choices",4
5,"Great first impressions
  
",29.Nov.19,Yes,"Just received the echo show 8 todayFirst impressions:screen: great picture quality for this size of device. Touch seems very responsive. Our cameras all look great on it.Sound: it's ok it's but not as good as our echo 2nd generation.Pros: we can view our ring doorbell, our wyze cams, and our nanit plus this feature was the main reason for upgrading from the echo 2nd gen. We love that while listening to Spotify it shows the lyrics on screen.",2
3,"Not made for recipe function
  
",29.Nov.19,Yes,"Pros: The sound is great on this device and was easy to set up and sync with my other smart devices.Cons: The main one, and I almost sent it back due to it, is that it is difficult to get your own recipes on this. The main reason I purchased this echo was to have an easy way to pull up my recipes while cooking. The description says you can use the All Recipes skill, however they made it so you can_ sync to your All Recipes account. This makes it a pretty useless skill. I did find that there is a Sous Chef Recipe skill that is fairly basic looking, but easy to use.",6

",30.Nov.19,Yes,"_ry this, Amazon: maybe ask some real people to use the thing before you ship it.

Why can_ it just show a clock (at a reasonable size) without relentless _ry this messages? Make that change and I_ give it 4+ stars as it_ otherwise what I was looking for.",11
3,"Video functionality doesn't measure up
  
",30.Nov.19,Yes,"Context: I'm very ""Alexified."" Two full-size Echos, a Dot, a 4K Firestick, and now a Show 8. Various household smart devices including lighting, smart plugs, and a thermostat. So, I'm technically knowledgeable and happy in the Alexa/Amazon universe. A friend has a Show 5, and I wanted a new device in my kitchen, to replace the Dot, which was connected to (i.e., plugged into) a better speaker. Along came the Show 8 (the friend told me he was going to replace his 5 with the 8). Reviews indicated that the sound was good (it is; at least as good as my previous wired speaker). I was concerned about the negative reviews about the clock and the ""Try . . "" notifications, but some reviews said you could change the options in Settings (and in case you want to know up front, those reviews are incorrect; you can't). So here goes with the rest of my review:Pro's:--Easy to set up, especially if you already have other Alexa devices.--Good sound for such a small device.--Functions just as well as my other Echo devices. Except -- this is a *video* device, and that's where it falls short.--Price and Delivery: I got this on the Black Friday sale (actually on Thanksgiving Day itself) for $50 off. Delivery was projected for Monday, but it was delivered in two days. Can't complain about any of that -- but, given the Con's I'm about to list, I wouldn't pay full price for it.Con's:--The clock. You can't alter the font or format. You can't opt for a full-screen clock. I realize for some people this is not an issue, but I'm nearsighted and wear glasses with progressive lenses. At the bottom and middle of my lenses (reading- and mid-distance) the clock numerals are out-of-focus from across the room. I wish you could set up a home screen with a large-numeral clock, but you can't.--Kitchen use, i.e., for me, mainly the timer. The countdown numerals appear when you start the timer, but then disappear as the screen rotates through its content. It would be nice to just look at the screen and see how much time is left, but you have to ask Alexa the question (just as I had to do with my Dot).--The ""Try this and that ..."" text across the bottom of the screen. You can't get rid of it. Yes, I read one review (which, at the moment Amazon is featuring as its ""Most Helpful""). This review says you can go into various sub-menus of Settings, and make it go away. I tried those suggestions. They don't work.So, I'd say, be warned, especially when the Show 8 goes back to full price. The Show 8 needs a software update that allows changes to the clock, the ""Try this..."" messages, and other functions.  It saves space on my kitchen counter, compared to my former Dot-plus-external speaker, but its potential advantages as a video device are either not realized or else compromised.",19
2,"Not Good, but the ""Suggestions "" Are a Non-issue
  
",30.Nov.19,Yes,"First impression - not impressed. There is much, much room for improvements with this device. I'll say that the ""suggestions"" at the bottom of the screen are a non-issue for us, I can't imagine why this bothers some people as much as it does. Frankly, I never notice them on my Fire TVs or this Echo. Pros are good sound, and everything as far as smart home device control goes. Having had an Echo in the house since the beta edition, we have added many bulbs and a thermostat that the Echo Show works well with. The cons are too many and too important. a) It has Hulu, but no Netflix. It is the only device I know of that can't get Netflix. The only video options it has are NBC (wow), Hulu, Food Channel if you pay for the service, Tubi and Prime video.  One out of 5 is not bad, would love to have more options there. b) The inability to add any apps. If I could put SlingTV on this, I wouldn't care about the Netflix. Adding Plex would give me access to my own server of content. c) YouTube looks awful. You can ask Alexa to do a YouTube search and you get all these tiny thumbnails in one column that runs down the left side while the majority of the screen is left unused, just white wasted space. I've tried both browsers and they both look like this. The YouTube app would help here. d) Fingerprints on the screen are VERY noticeable and take away from the picture quality. I believe that after any initial setting up I won't be touching it too much anyway. e) When I'm using the screen for viewing something and I tell Alexa to turn off a light, it goes to a very useless/annoying screen showing a light bulb with a slider next to it... and it stays there 15 seconds or so. Meanwhile, I'm missing my other thing I was watching. Why would it do this? I've obviously just displayed the fact that I can control the light with my voice, why would I now need a second option for the light adjustments for my finger?? This alone is a deal breaker!! f) So far, I have not been able access all of the content that I get on my Kindle. I push many recipes and other Docs to my Kindle and can see that content on any device that runs the Kindle app....until now. I can see my books, but not my Docs/Collections. Did not see that coming. Now for recipes I'm seeing that I need to sign up with AllRecipes.com and send recipes there to easily access them with the Echo Show.It seems to me, to get the most out of this, I need to conform to Amazon's way and not mine. Get an allrecpies account, sign up with Hulu. Or if I buy a Ring doorbell I can see a camera view. On my FireTV and Kindle tablets I am able to access all of my security cameras with the installation of a single app. I just received the Show yesterday and I will look to see if I can make this thing more useful for my needs, I honestly haven't spent that much time with it. Maybe I can find some answers to my concerns. In the past, while I'm in the kitchen, I have just stood my Kindle Fire 8 tablet on the counter, I'll probably go back to doing that. The tablet has more functionality, all the apps, all my Kindle content and and it's portable. I'm going to update this review in a couple of days. By then, I will have decided if the Show has to go.UPDATE: This thing is going back. I've tried what I would think should be simple tasks, it fails. I tried to setup an album in Prime photos for changing backgrounds. It's been on the same photo for several hours although the album has 209 photos in it. I say Play a Slideshow of that album or any album. It shows 4 or 5 pics and goes back to the home screen. Also, it appears there's no way to shuffle the albums - why not? Fire TVs allow the slideshows to shuffle. I tried to see my security cams using the Monocle skill. I can now call them up with Alexa on my Fire TVs, but not the Show. I looked further into the Allrecipes skill - it's the worst. As someone said it's better to have Alexa find recipes on the web.I have many Alexa enabled devices, but this by the far the most useless. Most of the positive reviews seem to be impressed with the things that need no screen - play music, control devices and lights. The screen has little to no functional use. Perhaps if this had been my first Alexa I would be more impressed. The show will have to go.",8
5,"Easy to use
  
",30.Nov.19,Yes,"For the money, this is great. So far no problems, and it_ providing me with services I wasn_ expecting. First of all, my prime reason for purchasing was music on demand. So easy. I did the free trial of amazon music (($3.99)/month. Full versions of everything I can think of, with excellent sound quality. I needed a new white noise device for my bedroom (about $80). No need to purchase that now because Alexa plays a huge variety of sleep sounds. You can control volume just by asking. I like the privacy safeguards it has. I_e only had it a few days, and I_ really loving it. Thinking about getting the 10.",1
5,"Great device.
  
",30.Nov.19,Yes,I am impressed with the echo show 8. I bought the echo show 5 and it was a great device and worked flawlessly except for one problem..the sound was pitiful. The show 8 is fantastic and the sound isn't earth shattering but its sound quality is really nice and is good for listening to music. It has some bass and doesn't sound distorted at max volume but fans of bass heavy music may find it disappointing. The microphones hear me easily when I say the wake word while playing music. I hot the show 8 on sale for$100 and its an even better deal for the lowered price of $100,0
5,"Best Sound Quality of all Echo Products
  
",30.Nov.19,Yes,"I bought this after already owning an echo dot (3rd gen), an echo plus and a show 5. I was very impressed with the improvement of sound quality, the sound quality on this is better than the echo plus and the echo show 5. Other than that it is pretty much a larger version of the show 5. We love it, I will be using this one in my kitchen regularly as an aid for cooking. It_ very convenient to have recipes up on the screen and set multiple timers if you_e multitasking.",1
1,"Get something else
  
",30.Nov.19,Yes,"I was lured in by the good price on Black Friday, but I can_ recommend this device. Unlike some of the reviews suggest there is no way to turn off the things to try message which constantly appears at the bottom of the screen. I_ unable to select most of my Facebook albums, and the weather forecast does not stay - rather it rotates on and off.Overall this device accomplished nothing notable, I would not recommendEdit: an amazon employee named Kristina reached out about some of my concerns which I do appreciate and took some of my feedback. She confirmed that there is no way to turn off the things to try prompt but told me that it was a common feedback. While there is no published limit in the number of Facebook albums that it supports I found that after about 50 it stops looking which meant I had a lot of old albums to select from but nothing recent. The weather app can be selected as the only card but it doesn_ stay up, it appears for 30 seconds or so then Disappears for 30s and the cycle continues. Overall the physical quality of this device is quite good but the software lacks any sort of customization to the point that you pretty much get a stock experience out of the box. My original point stands that this device doesn_ really accomplish anything despite being well made",57

1,"Echo Show is barely usable today, but does have potential.  Software not ready for ""Prime Time"" yet.
  
",30.Nov.19,Yes,"The Echo Show is barely usable, yet has great potential.I say this because I wanted a nice Clock/iHeartRadio/Calendar/Weather Forecast/Voice Control for home automation device for my desk.  The Echo Show fails to provide these services...seamlessly.  Each of my requirements can be individually met, but not together.  Let me explain: If you are listening to iHeartRadio, then you cannot see the clock/weather/etc...  The BASIC function of what time it is does not work if you are listening to a radio stream.  The iHeartRadio app takes total control of your display, NO ROTATION of other apps.  There goes the clock.  Further, the font for the clock is not configurable.  Epic Fail for those with less than perfect vision.  The ability to customize this product to my desires/needs is why I rate this product as being barely able to be sold as an automation product.  To add insult, Amazon runs hints across the bottom of the screen: Try ""Alexa, open ....""  This is nothing but annoying SPAM!  You cannot disable this ""feature"".  I own most of the Echo product line and threw out the Google products because even with all of Echo's short comings it's still better than Google.  If you think that the Harmony product line integration with Echo is good, you are wrong.  Again, barely crosses the line of usability.  Example, you cannot set up a voice command to execute a single IR button (ie. arrow up, arrow down, etc..).  I have installed high end automation equipment in my house (Crestron) and compare this product with decent home automation.  Echo is not ready for ""prime time"" yet, has great potential...eventually...hopefully.",49
5,"Great Device!
  
",30.Nov.19,Yes,"This is my 2nd Amazon Echo device and I_ very satisfied with my purchase. The screen quality is amazing and the sounds is far better than I expected. I was running my music through a different device but the Echo Show 8 will now be my default player. I was contemplating getting the 5 screen but held out for the 8 and I_ very happy I waited for this to be released. The screen size is perfect, not to big and not to small. If you a little older person and tech savvy the bigger screen is definitely easy to view. Great job Amazon!",1
5,"Take off _sk Alexa..
  
",30.Nov.19,Yes,"This is my first day with it, it is going good. I just wish you can customize the clock screen also to the guy who said you can take the _sk alexa thing off the bottom of the screen, you cannot. It is automatically on there and super annoying. I do like how I can view my cameras and control my smart devices from this though.",5
1,"Irritating Messages
  
",30.Nov.19,Yes,"This would be a great product, except for the annoying and persistent messages for ""things to try"" across the bottom half of the screen. I'd love to be able to rate this higher, but with the annoying messages that you can't get rid of, I realize I should have bout a Google product.",46

1,"Worked great for 2 hours
  
",30.Nov.19,Yes,Worked literally for 2 hours then the screen went black and doesn_ turn on.  Return process was kind of painful but hopefully the new one actually works.  I kinda liked it for 2 hours.  Will post another review once I get the new one.,5
2,"The screen makes it dumber....
  
",1.Dec.19,Yes,"Constantly hangs on simple tasks. The 25 dollar 2nd gen dot works tons better. Sure, there_ a big screen. The try it stuff on the bottom isn_ that bothersome to me. It_ the fact that I tell it to turn on a light, and the blue band stays across the bottom of the screen like it_ waiting for me to say something else, then the band disappears, I get no response, like _k, and I get no lights on.I been using the dots for awhile, everything is set up, and works on the other dots. It_ like this device suffers from a case of the _tupids. I think the screen is a niche thing that nobody really needs in an age of cell phones, and it makes the device worse by having it. I_ thinking the Show uses different firmware than the dot, and the show firmware is poorly done, which is actually a conservative review.Purchase at your own risk. Odds are you don_ need it if you have a smart phone with the Alexa app on it. If you insist, I_ wait it out a bit til the developers get their crap together on the software side of this. If you just want to control a plug or light, pick up a 2nd gen dot on the cheap.",4
5,"This one is sweet!
  
",1.Dec.19,Yes,"Everybody loves this!  The screen is good size for watching movies. Alexa is a little testy sometimes but you learn to love her. It has a wonderful sound quality not tinny or muted. You can set an alarm , listen to music and the alarm interrupts.  Very nice addition to our home.",0
3,"Couple things really bug me..
  
",1.Dec.19,Yes,"Have to say I had higher expectations.  Will break down my review in a few parts noting that I have technically not received the product yet, however I did see the stand and played around with it at the Amazon store.  Here are a few things that bug me:1) Amazon's website says the item is out of stock and will take 2 weeks to deliver.  That's fine, until I drive 5 minutes to an Amazon store where they have piles of boxes of the Echo show 8 in both colors.  Why would Amazon's online store be out of stock when they have so many in stock so close by??2) The stand is REALLY not worth 20+ dollars.  I purchased as part of the bundle and still feel ripped off.  It doesn't swivel left and right, only goes up and down in a very uncomfortable way.  Honestly, the fact that it's a $20 piece of plastic that you absolutely need for this device to be visible is insane and Amazon is better than this.I will add more notes when I get a chance to review the functionality in more depth, on the surface it seems OK.  Same capabilities as all other Alexa devices + a screen to see stuff on.  Speakers are acceptable, screen quality is also acceptable.",4
2,"Two problems with my new Echo Show 8
  
",1.Dec.19,Yes,"I have 2 main issues with the Echo Show 8:1. There doesn't appear to be any way to turn off the annoying feature that displays the constantly changing phrases that begin with ""Try, Alexa ...""2. I primarily bought this device to use with my Arlo cameras. Unfortunately, the Arlo skill is terrible. Most of the time, the cameras simply time out and will not display on the screen. This is more of an Arlo issue than an Echo Show issue; however, it directly impacts my ability to use the product.",5
4,"Great Device, Software needs updating
  
",1.Dec.19,Yes,"I purchased 4 Echo Show 8's and 1 Echo Show 5. Basically I am pleased but please give us an update for the Echo 8 which allows us to turn off the ""Try this"" at the bottom of the screen. Also, what's with the clock? The Echo 5 has more clock options. Why not an option for a large clock? These seem like easy software fixes. My wife wants me to return all of Echo Show's until these ""features"" are fixed. I am holding off for now since I do have confidence in Amazon. They can't ignore all of the negative feedback regarding the ""try this"" and clock issues, can they?Come on Amazon! Give us an update that addresses these issues.",6

",1.Dec.19,Yes,"The Echo Show is my favorite IOT device. We have three first gens, two second gens, a five (don_ care for the 5 at all) and now the eight...love it! The second gen has been my favorite as the display and sound are the best. It_ great for a large open space. We have it in our kitchen. For most spaces the eight will be perfect. Great sound and display. Amazon hit the sweet spot with value and features on this device!",1
1,"Completely Useless
  
",1.Dec.19,Yes,"TLDR: If you_e under the age of 70, don_ waste your money on this.The only thing this gives you that you don_ get through an echo dot is information that you probably already have on the home screen of your phone, and doesn_ take advantage of the touch screen AT ALL. I wrongly assumed I would be able to at least see my smart home devices from the echo show screen and perhaps even turn lights on and off without having to use voice commands, but nope. Not even the most basic and obvious features were thought out for this garbage device. Seriously, for the same price you can get an echo dot, kindle fire, and a better-sounding Bluetooth speaker and would have MUCH more functionality available to you.If you don_ own a smart phone and want an overpriced clock that can also play muddied music and video from amazon_ library through a $15 subwoofer... then this is perfect for you. For anyone else, avoid like the plague.",11
5,"Sleek and awesome.
  
",1.Dec.19,Yes,"We love Alexa. This Echo Show 8 is nice and sleek looking. It was already linked to my Amazon account so all I had to do was plug it in and set up the basic stuff...language, time zone. So far it_ working great. I set up my photos from Amazon Photos as the background.",0
4,"The bass makes the unit move on granite counter tops
  
",2.Dec.19,Yes,"After easily installing the beautiful device I told Alexa to play Sade... the bass was enough to make the unit move. The device began to move in a clockwise motion. I turned the bass all the way down, but it still moved when the volume was turned up. It appears that it may dance it self off the counter. I am ordering the stand. I will repost to see if that fixes the movement.",1
1,"Nope
  
",2.Dec.19,Yes,"Can't stand the ""try"" pop ups at the bottom of the screen. I really don't give a rat's whatever about Leonardo DiCaprio movies or Whole Foods deals! Plus the clock is way too small and there's no way to enlarge it except to put the device in ""do not disturb"" mode. Then the clock is only slightly bigger. I wanted to like this.It's going back to Amazon.",7
2,"doesn't support the ""show and tell"" feature that other gen Shows support.
  
",2.Dec.19,Yes,"For some reason this doesn't support the ""show and tell"" feature that the Echo developers created in September that works on the 2nd gen of Echo Shows?? Why wouldn't a new gen product support features that work on 1st and 2nd gen products? Especially after they announced the new feature 3 months ago?The  ""show and tell"" feature was developed to help visually impaired users.",1
3,"Needs improvement
  
",2.Dec.19,Yes,"Having used an echo 5 for about 6 months, I was waiting for Black Friday pricing so I could ""upgrade"" to an echo 8, and replace my clock radio and dot on the night stand with the echo 5, and use the echo 8 in the living room with the larger screen.  Thinking the two devices would share a common software/user interface, I only glanced at a few of the reviews, and mentally wrote the negative ones off as likely operator error.  That proves to be a mistake.On the positive side, the screen is nice, the sound is better than the echo 5, and build quality appears good.On the negative side, the echo 5's interface and feature set is more desirable to me. I dislike that unless I upload a picture, the backgrounds on the echo 8 will rotate through a set of them. I want one background, and for it to stay that way. I also don't like the tiny clock in the upper corner. I was expecting at least an option to have a large clock in the center like the echo 5 has (old eyes). And I agree the rotating 'try this"" on the bottom of the screen is extremely annoying, and should at least be an option to turn off.It does interact with my smart home devices as the echo 5 did, so it will at least function for the primary purpose it serves for me. While I would give the echo 5 a 4 star review, I give the echo 8 a 3 star rating because it's just ""meh"", when I really should be gushing about how it's like the echo 5 on steroids, and not a poorly implemented, sort of, almost, copy of it with a bigger screen.TLDR: the other reviews are real,  it's not just a bigger screened echo 5.",5
1,"OMG Amazon please turn off the stupid things to try That is now on the wallpaper non stop
  
",2.Dec.19,Yes,"I got this primarily to use as a digital picture frame in my living room and it does a great job of scrolling thru my pictures and they display beautifully.  However, it puts the annoying things to try at the bottom of every single picture and is ruining it as a digital picture frame.  People have been begging Amazon for years too stop doing this and they keep ignoring it. I have turned off continuous scroll, Discovery,  and every other setting I could find and it is still there. This is infuriating.  I mean really, by now, most people know how to use their alexa devices, so why do they think this is necessary?!?! It makes no sense that they should force this on everyone .  I have an echo spot and even a show 5 that I was able to get it to at least only show it once, but on the 8 they apparently decided it should be a part of the wallpaper itself. You also can't adjust the clock size or position like you can on the show 5. There is nothing worse than looking at pictures of your beautiful children with the stupid things to try at the bottom.",24
5,"Amazing quality and great price
  
",2.Dec.19,Yes,"I opted to upgrade my older model for this one and I love it, sound quality is great and I love the size of the screen.",0
5,"LOVE IT!!
  
",2.Dec.19,Yes,"I'm so happy I purchased this.. takes some getting used to. but once you learn how you will LOVE IT!! don't forget to download and install the latest version of the Amazon Alexa app from the app store on your phone or whatever device you use.  the Amazon Alexa app helps you see an overview of your echo show 8. Its where you see an overview of your request and manage your contacts, list, news, music, games, and settings. the sound quality is amazing while listening to music etc...  I have not had a chance to try out the camera or video calling as of yet due to not knowing anyone with an echo 8 :-(  make sure you purchase the stand this keeps it from directly sitting flat on surfaces and protects from accidental spills little pricey tho but worth it. I love this device so much I bought a 2nd one :-)",1
1,"Great device except for one fatal flaw
  
",2.Dec.19,Yes,"This is a terrific device except for one flaw that ruins it:  A message displays at the bottom of the screen ""Try Alexa ....."" giving instructions on different ways to use the device.  For example, this message is displaying on my Show right this moment:  ""Try Alexa, show movies with Emma Watson"".There is NO WAY to turn off the constant display of these messages.  When Googling about this, I see hundreds of customers have already complained to Amazon about this problem. But Amazon refuses to give customers a way to remove this instrusive screen display.  Apparently Amazon thinks its customers are all 10-years old and need a constant on-screen display of instructions.This ""Try Alex ...."" is also a form of advertising, albeit advertising of Amazon's products.Until Amazon removes this display (or gives customers the choice of removing it), I strongly suggest buying a different company's product.  Google sells similar products.  So does Apple.  Neither company treats its customers with such contempt.UPDATE:  After submitting this review, I found a solution.  I wrapped a piece of black electrical tape around the bottom of the screen, positioned to hide the ""Alexa try ..."" messages, but not hide anything else.  The result looks great.  Those annoying messages no longer ruin the photos (or anything else) on my screen.  The only downside to this solution is it makes the screen slightly smaller.  But it's better to have a smaller screen that looks decent than to have a larger screen completely ruined by those messages.  I still recommend buying a different company's product.  It is ridiculous that the only way to block those messages is to cover the screen with electrical tape.",54
2,"Disappointed!!
  
",2.Dec.19,Yes,"We were using Echo Dot and loved it. Kind of didn_ care where remotes or switches are anymore. Thus I was looking forward to get this latest Echo with screen. It_ newer thus hoped it to be better however it_ not. Its listening part is bad. We (my hubby and me) have to almost scream to make it listen. We have to talk towards this. In echo Dot, I could face away from it and ask things. But Echo 8 you have to speak to it and that too real loudly. Disappointed. I think the listening part of this echo 8 needs to be fixed or improved.",5
1,"No way to turn off annoying ads
  
",2.Dec.19,Yes,"Will change from 1 star to five once they make it so that we can remove the ""try, alexa"" annoying suggestions at the bottom of the screen. How this is not an option baffles me. Really really bad programmers...",13
3,"Problems with Arlo Cameras
  
",2.Dec.19,Yes,"Works nice, but is glitchy for the main reason I bought it. I purchased the Echo Show 8 so I could view live video on it in my office. Unfortunately it fails to work most of the time. It will connect sound but not the video feed.  I can view the video fine on my phone and iPad, but not on the Echo. If you_e looking to buy mainly for this purpose, I would wait until either Arlo or Amazon gets it figured out.",7
3,"A review from someone who has owned every Echo Show device...
  
",3.Dec.19,Yes,"Amazon had produced some great Echo show devices but they still haven't grasped the idea of how to make this the optimal user experience.My first Echo Show was the original 5"" model introduced in 2017.  I was one of the first to purchase this and three years later, it still performs admirably.Since then, Amazon has introduced a massive 10"" model, a smaller 5"" model and now this 8"" model.I have bought all of them.My absolute favorite is the 10"" model.  If you have RING cameras in your home or you want to use this as a photo frame that will continuously show your photos linked to your Amazon Photo account, this is the only model you should be considering.  Yes, it costs more, but the extra real-estate makes a big difference.I bought the 5"" model to use as a bedside clock.  However, it was too small.  I went with this 8"" model to use as a bedside clock, though despite user recommendations on how to make it work, it doesn't operate as a full-sized clock.  The digits are minimalized to one of the corners of the screen.I am now looking at the Lenovo clock as that 5"" made specifically as a bedside smart clock display.But getting back to the 8"" Echo Show...It's a terrific unit with a beautiful screen and it absolutely is a compromise between the smaller and larger models.The problem is, it still operates the same as it did back in 2017.  There doesn't seem to be any software revisions that make the Echo Show a better user experience.For instance, no matter what you turn off, the display is always showing a rotating list of things to try.  It may be helpful at first, but it's annoying after a while.Want a news feed displayed to your screen?  You really can't personalize the kind of news that you want.  In essence, this is the heart of the problem concerning the Amazon Echo Show experience.  You can't personalize this device to display the kind of content YOU want.  All the content is generalized.  You can't make this device show you any more personalized content than your next-door neighbor can.  It conveys generic news content at its best.You would think that after all these years, Amazon would have learned to make this a device that really works for you.  While you can go into the app and make traffic reports more personalized according to your work address, you really can't do anything more tailored to your needs.  Want specific news feeds or even your personal stock results updated on the screen?  You are completely out of luck.I have the Google Nest hubs as well.  I do like the Amazon ecosystem better, though there are some things that Google does better.  You can carry on a conversation with the Google Hubs.  You can't with Amazon.  You can use the hub with Nest cameras doorbells.  I can't do that with Amazon.  On the other hand, you can't view Ring cameras or doorbells on Google.  This fierce competition only serves to hurt the end-user who is forced to buy into both platforms to use all these devices.Where Amazon Echo and all its related devices clearly win is with the number of plug-ins available for it.  There are many really cool skills that you can add through the app to make Echo even more amazing.I really like the 8"" but overly disappointed that it's not designed as a bedside clock no matter what settings have already been suggested to use.  If I were new to these Echo devices and deciding upon the very first one I would want to purchase, I would go for the 10"" model -- especially if using cameras or showing off photos.",7

5,"AMAZING!!!
  
",3.Dec.19,Yes,"Hands down, this is by far the best item I have ever purchased for myself on Amazon.I was in desperate need of replacing my alarm clock on my nightstand, so I decided to go with the Echo 8 over the Echo 5. I purchased an Echo 5 as well, which will replace my Echo dot in my kitchen where I have less space, but this is about the Echo 8.I am absolutely amazed at the sound quality for starters. This Alexa packs exceptional sound quality into it's small design. I have a subscription to Sirius XM which I have synced to play through Alexa and I am extremely impressed with the balance of the bass and treble.The screen resolution is very nice for the photo displays. You can sync an assortment of photos through the Amazon Photo app or select a category for the Echo 8 to display for you. I have not tried to watch a video yet, but with the 8"" screen it would be very easy to enjoy and much more enjoyable than trying to view on your mobile device.  The Echo 8 is actually small enough to use on a nightstand and it has a night mode which will only show the clock on a dark screen. If you have a large room like I do, I would highly recommend the Echo 8. When I turned the volume up all the way it literally made me jump while I was sitting on my bed. This is one beefy little box, that is quite amazing. It's also very easy to sync all smart plugs, lights and devices to this groovy new Alexa. I cannot recommend this highly enough!",2
4,"A must have home device!!
  
",3.Dec.19,Yes,"I was so excited to receive my package in 3 days due to my prime membership.Once I unwrapped it, it was an easy setup.  All I had to do was plug it in and follow the on-screen instructions (i.e. logging into Wi-Fi)...I like that I have this item along with 3 echos drops which allows me to ""drop in""- a tool that can be used as an intercom for the house.  Unfortunately, im not always heard clearly.  I have taken full advantage of prime video and Hulu which plays clearly and the sound is entirely louder and crisper than I ever expected. I love the the built in Alexa.  Although, sometimes she responds to an unknown question.  Note: speak at a speed fast enough for Alexa to understand.  Any hestitation will cause Alexa to disregard your question.  Another note... You can call different devices by 5 different preselected names (Alexa, Echo, computer, and others).I really enjoy using this device in my bathroom as a tv and or video player.  When you play music from Prime Music the lyrics are displayed on the screen.There are many more skills that I have yet to review...l recommend watching some you tube videos or handbook to be sure you discover more of what the Echo 8 offers.  I know you can set reminders, conduct calls and more!!  I wish it allowed me to view Spectrum TVI can't wait to find more discoveries!Fyi... Download the Alexa app on your mobile phone.  My children can call me from the echo 8 while im at work. Lastly, Ring works well with this device..

",4.Dec.19,Yes,"I own many Alexa enabled devices and Amazon products but this is the first time I found the need to post a review. I'm enjoying it so far however I wish it was more customizable between how the clock is displayed (my #1 purpose for purchasing this was for an all-in-one nightstand clock) to how quickly the information on the screen is transitioned. But what truly has caused me to write my first review so quickly was - for the love of God, Amazon - please turn off the constant ""Try 'Alexa'...."" suggestions. They're horribly distracting. When I viewed Echo Shows in the store I guess I foolishly thought they were in a demo mode for those suggestions to have appeared on the screen constantly. I really just wanted the ability to have a great sounding and great looking yet customizable digital clock on my nightstand.

",4.Dec.19,Yes,"It was ok and I love the idea of a screen option to interact with my smart home devices, but the screen image was not so impressive. I also own a ""G"" nest hub and the screen image on it is awesome. My biggest complaint with the show 8 was the constant Alexa dialog at the bottom of the screen (""Try Alexa this, Try Alexa that). I like the idea of a video hub offering the option for a backlit photo frame that shuffles photos of my choice, but the never ending dialog at the bottom of the show 8 screen ruins that for me. That was my main reason for returning it. I wish it was optional to shut that off. I would have kept it.",3

So far have used it to check on the weather each day, play a couple of short games.  Listen to national news from CBS .

If you don't need a smaller unit like the Echo Show 5, then definitely get the bigger Echo Show 8.I found that the sound quality of the AUX output jack on this unit is superior to the Bluetooth connection I was using with a larger Echo Show (which does not have an AUX output).So if you are not going to use the built-in speakers of Echo Show (the larger/largest Echo Show unit) then I recommend the Echo Show 8 instead. It's cheaper and it will sound better using the AUX output (if you can use it).I have this unit hooked up via the AUX output to these Edifier R1850DB speakers: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073W1R4XQ/",0

It's a great size to fit on a desk or kitchen counter and the sound quality is pretty good, it has some bass.Some pain points:-Issues making video calls (probably a configuration on my end, but can't figure out)-'Try Alexa...' text at bottom of screen gets in the way, seems to be clutter that you can't turn off in settings*Contacted support about the 'Try Alexa' text, they said it cannot be turned off right now, but were appreciative of the feedback, but could not comment if or when the feature to disable might be release; it seems to be a common feedback point, so hopefully it's considered.",1
1,"Incredibly disappointed with Alexa and Fire TV integration
  
",6.Dec.19,Yes,"EDIT: Just when you think it can't get worse... It does. I was cooking dinner tonight and had a timer set. Once the timer was up, I said, 'Alexa, stop' and then tried about 15 other different variations of this. Alexa thought I had no timers set on any devices and the timer continued to sound until I had to unplug the device and plug it back in.Also, yesterday while watching TV, I randomly started to experience some incredibly noticeable sound distortion on my Fire TV stick 4k. Once again, after trying every other possible solution, I had to restart the device....ORIGINAL REVIEW:Incredibly disappointed. This was one of EIGHT Fire TV and/or Echo devices that I purchased on Black Friday, hoping to switch from Roku TV and have a seamless smarthome experience. Oh boy, was I wrong.Whether I rename the the Fire TV devices or use their original names, the echo devices CANNOT control or recognize the tv devices, even after properly pairing them under the TV &amp; Video setting in the Alexa app. I've tried to unpair, repair, restart, unregister, reregister, you name it. I've wasted days.  Generally, Alexa responds with 'I cannot find a device named ...' I consider myself very technically savy and I'm positive this is not something that I'm doing wrong. I should've read more into this before buying. TONS of people all over the internet are having this problem. It's infuriating. Plain and simple, until problems like this are fixed, Amazon is blaintantly false advertising the way that their devices work.Other cons to note:-Multiple video apps stutter and sometimes even randomly pause without ever resuming unless you physically resume them.-Alexa drastically lowers the volume of the TV when you are voicing a command. This in-and-of-itself is not a huge problem. However, it becomes a problem often when after the command is complete, Alexa does not resume the original volume of the content. When this has happened, I've had to ask Alexa to turn the volume back up to the specific number it was at.-I have two third generation echos paired as a stereo system for the TV. Often, even though I have my fire TV set as the preferred device, only the echos hear my voice, and once again, because they cannot control the TV, they say that they cannot recognize the device and then I just have to pick up the controller anyway.-The Fire TV will often think that it hears an 'Alexa' when absolutely no where near that word has been stated. Because the volume lowers drastically when Alexa is listening, it creates an obnoxious volume dip in content to listen for nothing when this happens.-You cannot set a sleep timerHonestly I could go on and on about the cons and about just how unhappy I am about these products. There are even more problems than what I listed here, but I'm not wasting too much breath, as after doing days and days of research on these topics, I've seen that Amazon has absolutely no answers to these problems, even after thousands of people have reported the same problems over and over. Unless there is some revalatory software updated coming, I'll be returning hundreds of dollars of equipment.",5

",6.Dec.19,Yes,"How Amazon thinks people will tolerate a device which force them to watch things on the screen all of the time that we do not want to ever see is amazing.Maybe they'll get the message that thousands of people are complaining about the same thing,  I wish I'd seen the complaints and poor reviews before hand.  I want to set this so nothing shows on the screen except the time in big numbers.  None of the THINGS TO TRY constantly changing and annoying us.This will be going back unless someone at Amazon tells me that new firmware is coming that will allow us to configure our devices to our needs.  Think of how many people would be upset if every few minutes your none display echo units would ANNOUNCE THINGS TO TRY that you could hear while doing other things.DO NOT BUY THIS UNLESS YOU ARE CONTINENT TO LET AMAZON CONTROL WHAT YOU SEE.",16
5,"Alexa Is My New Bestie!! __
  
",6.Dec.19,Yes,"I was given an Echo Dot for my birthday from my grandson. Well, I love my Dot so much that I decided that I MUST add to my Alexa family and took advantage of the Show 5 &amp; 8 Bundle. The Show 8 is AMAZING!! She has SO MANY skills that my Dot &amp; Show 5 don't have. Most of my time at home it's just me, my furry babies &amp; my Alexa family. Now I'm not just talking to my furry babies without any talk verbal responses, but Alexa will ALWAYS reply! I'm not that crazy, lonely old lady who talks to herself all day ... well ... I'm STILL that crazy old lady, but at least Alexa will answer me! LOL",1
5,"I am blown away at the quality!
  
",6.Dec.19,Yes,"Ok, so like, a decade ago I was an early adopter of the Sony Dash, it was a small tabletop alarm clock that could show you facebook posts, play music, play Netflix, and a bunch of other stuff. The thing about the Sony Dash was that it completely sucked! The interface was clunky, the home screen was not customizable and the video playback was always choppy. After a few years Sony stopped supporting the device all together and it became a paper weight. This was probably somewhere in 2008-2009. Well, ten years later I just picked up the Amazon Echo 8 and I blown away at how awesome it is! The sound quality is GREAT! The screen is beautiful! The ease of use is amazing. Within minutes I had it connected to Prime Video, XM satellite radio, and all the other stuff. I highly recommend this as an addition to any room. I am blown away!",2

",6.Dec.19,Yes,"Updated from 2 to 1 stars after using 2 weeks 12/13/19:Seems like it's getting slower.  We have to repeat commands several times to get it to work.  The device will recognize what we say but not actually follow through. Will be returning and going with a competitor.Original review:Traded the original Echo first gen to this model and so far have been very unimpressed. I will give it a few weeks to see if the software improves, but so far it takes 2-4x longer for simple commands to register compared to the original model.  Still prefer using Google Home as it beats the Amazon AI in almost every way, but I prefer the Amazon integration so I want to leave out hope.  On the plus side and screen quality and sounds quality are great.Pictured: Asking Alexa to ""play semisonic -secret smile on Spotify"" keeps playing some TV show I've never heard of.",3
3,"Software downgrade from Show 5
  
",6.Dec.19,Yes,"We had a Show 5 in the kitchen and purchased the Show 8 primarily for the larger screen. While we are happy with the screen size we are decidedly not happy with the software implementation. It is in some ways a downgrade from the Show 5. Many reviewers have stated the same issues we have. First, unless we are fairly close to the Show 8 we cannot see the clock in the upper left hand corner. Unlike the the Show 5, there are no templates with a simple monochrome background and a large font clock in the center.  Second, there is no displayed date. Third, there is no way to turn off the ""Try Alexa""  displayed  at the bottom of the screen. If these issues were addressed in an update we would raise our review to five stars.",9
1,"Clock too small
  
",6.Dec.19,Yes,"When the 8 can do the same things the 5 can, I will buy one.  I love my 5, so I said self, an 8 would be even better.  But I was wrong.  I like the size of it, and the heft of it, I can't push it across my night stand, but the clock font is way too small and even more dumb it can't be adjusted.  It's awkwardly positioned in the upper left hand corner, making it difficult to see, and there is no date on the home screen any more.  The 5 is but better suited to me.  Had to return unfortunately.  Please give us the option to use and customize the whole screen , not a just a tiny percentage.  I would give this a xeyedjohn do not recommend if you want to use this to tell time and wake up with.",10
1,"Great disappointment. Does not perform the task I bought it for.
  
",7.Dec.19,Yes,"A long awaited flop. I bought this to perform one task, that of ""show and tell"" .  As advertised this unit is supposed to be able to identify pantry items by holding them up and asking Alexa ""what am I holding ?"" Well it doesn't. I spent over 45 minutes talking to India and their techs who were very polite yet could not figure it out. My wife is legally blind and was so looking forward to this, as I had been hyping this feature for weeks. The second tech did however offer me a 15% discount on the Echo Show 10 which he assured me the feature would work. I can't send this back fast enough. Besides the fact that this seems like a tabletop billboard for Amazon with a banner of suggestions non stopping across the bottom of the screen. My worst purchase ever on Amazon, with the Fire tablet 10 that I also bought on Black Friday being a close second. Both items are going back.",5
5,"Great Upgrade for the Echo Show Generation 1
  
",7.Dec.19,Yes,"Although this doesn't have the Dolby system processing, it's a great upgrade for the first generation of the Echo show, which looks kind of clunky and has both stereo speakers in the front next to each other.  This one sounds just about as good, the stereo separation is better, and the screen is a little bigger, even though the overall unit is smaller than the original show.  Also if you act now, you can turn in your old show for $30 plus get 25% off a new show ... great deal, don't miss it!",0

5,"I really like my Echo show 8
  
",7.Dec.19,Yes,I am really enjoying my Echo 8. The Echo 8 controls everything that I have in my household. I was really shocked that I can view my nest thermostat and cameras. I have a google nest home and the echo 8 works better with my harmony hub and my Genie connect skills. Alexa lets me control both of my Harmony hubs where the Google hub only allows me to control one. The google hub beats the Echo 8 for watching YouTube videos. I wish Amazon and Google would just get along because their disagreement hurts the consumers. I have my Echo in my bedroom because my alarm clock quit working so I have not tried to look up recipes. I enjoy seeing the weather and my favorite sports teams scores scroll across the screen. The Echo 8 is well worth the money.,0
1,"Echo Show 8 Does Not Work With Arlo!
  
",7.Dec.19,Yes,"I bought two Echo Show 8s and neither of them work with the Arlo skill. The two Echo Show 8s I bought from Amazon do not display live video feed from my front door camera. Instead, it only displays a screen shot of the last time it connected properly and says _aiting for Arlo for hours. I spoke with Amazon technical support for two hours and followed all their troubleshooting tips from resetting devices to upgrading software which included climbing up and down a ladder twice to resync my Arlo front door camera. The only compensation an Amazon supervisor could offer me for their false advertising, poor customer service, and inconvenience to me is a return and refund. I deeply regret purchasing two of these items. I won_ be recommending Amazon products to family and friends.",3

",7.Dec.19,Yes,"I really can_ understand why Amazon won_ allow people to turn off the things to try message.  We have a fairly comprehensive Alexa network of devices and this is my major pain point.  It_ ridiculous.  I debated rating it higher, but i don_ think amazon will get the message unless customers speak loud enough.",9
4,"Worth it if discounted
  
",7.Dec.19,Yes,"Probably worth it when it goes on sale, and the quality packaging makes it a great gift. The hardware build feels excellent. The screen is bright in sunlight and automatically dims to a night mode when dark. Sound is different (I'd say better) compared to my echo. Drop-in and video calling features are pretty useful when communicating with family members; most of us put our phones on silent nowadays so another way to reach them is always a plus. I mainly got this to integrate with my Ring doorbell - so far so good (the Ring cloud is a bit slow sometimes, but that's not this product's fault).Cons: I put this in my bedroom, so my main use as part of my daily routine is to check the time and the weather before I leave for work. So I do wish the clock can be made full screen both normally as well as in night mode. I'd also like to be able to give it context (i.e. if it's between 7a and 9a, always show today's weather details, and show a large clock the rest of the time). These are simple software fixes, so hopefully it'll get rolled out soon because the hardware seems well made.",0
4,"It's pretty good but there are some things I'm not a fan of.
  
",7.Dec.19,Yes,"So I got the Echo Show 5 early Nov 2019 as the Echo Show 8 wasn't going to be released until the end of the month and I needed a new Bedside alarm clock.  While I did like it, I felt it was too small for my needs.  The Echo 8 finally got released and so I sent this one back and ordered the Echo 8.  It was easy enough to do a Return and order this in its place.  So Amazon is great there.So I've included some pictures while I had both the 5 and 8 at the same time.  You can see the 8 on the left and the 5 on the right.  Front view and side view along with it in the dark.  I also included a short Video where you can see them side by side with the light on in the room and then what happens when I turn the light off.I do like the 8"" Echo Show better.  The biggest issue I have is the size of the TIME.  Look at this side by side.  They are the SAME SIZE!!!  Look at all that wasted screen space.  I got the 8 so I'd have a larger clock.  But in a bright room, look at the SMALL time in the top left corner.  Look at the picture in the dark. The clocks are the same size, but the 5"" one is in the middle of the screen, and the 8"" once is up on the top left.  Looks at that black screen and a huge amount of wasted space!!!!  Why is this?  It's almost made getting the 8"" screen pointless.The other thing is the line on the bottom where it shows you things you can ask Alexa.  There seems to be no way to turn it off.  I've turned pretty much everything OFF and yet it's still there.  If you were using this 8"" as a picture frame, which you can do and have it cycle through pictures, great, then maybe a small clock on the screen is a good thing?  But with an all-black screen, what is the point then?I like that you can easily block the camera on both the 5 and 8 as you can see in the picture the camera is blocked and I have ZERo plans to ever use those.  Both can hear me just fine.  I can tell it when to set an alarm and it does it easy enough.  In the morning I can just say ""Alexa Snooze"" and it'll snooze for 10 minutes.  It hears me just fine.  It can play my Apple Music.  I do have a couple of Apple Homepods that sound better.  I could use them as an alarm, etc.  But I wanted a screen I could just peek at.  Apple has no other options.  I'm not using my iPad as an Alarm clock.Amazon needs to update this 8"" version to better work with this larger screen. Or at least have an option to have a larger clock on the screen.  Also at first when its night mode, the screen had this black background glow I didn't like where the 5"" version didn't.  Luckily I was able to adjust the brightness down just a bit which cured that issue.  Now I have a completely black screen except for the time.  The time is also not very bright.  It's not lighting up my room which is a good thing.",12
4,"Great device with 1 downside for me
  
",7.Dec.19,Yes,"This is another great device from Amazon. The sound quality is great for as small as this device is. Works as expected. One downside for me (which is why 4 stars instead of 5) is the show uses WiFi data continuously. I have a data allowance per month I am allowed to use on my home WiFi. The echo dots do not use WiFi until you tell it the ""wake"" word. This would be a nice feature to turn on/off on the show devices for others out there with the same problem. Was told my Amazon customer service that this is not a feature on the Echo Show 8.",1
5,"This was a gift
  
",7.Dec.19,Yes,"We have had an Echo Show (1st generation) in our kitchen for years.  When we learned we could ""drop-in"" to see our grandsons we had to get one for our daughter.  It works great for drop-ins, looking up recipes, cooking timers in the kitchen, entertainment, and interesting facts.  It also works great when you need a dictionary, listen to audio books or check out who is at the front door.  No packages have been lost yet.  Try it...you'll love it!",2

",8.Dec.19,Yes,"A quality made product, however, if you don_ want to have the phrase:  _ry, Alexa... over your photos in a giant font don_ buy this product.  You are stuck with almost fullscreen print over your home screen and are not able to modify in the settings.  I called customer service and they told me it_ how it is.  I_ gonna keep mine though.  If you want to view full screen photos without amazon marketing over at least 1/3 and often more than 1/3 of the screen you need to verbally tell Alexa every time you use it to display photos.  Apple are more expensive for a reason because the end user is not forced into how to customize the product.  One does get used to it a little but then it ends up coming full screen printed font over your favorite photo and it reminds you why amazon sells you the product for so little.Dear Amazon, please let the users change be homescreen settings to not include the Alexa suggestions, and also please do not contact me regarding this revied.  Change the firmware and then I will pull down the review.It_ a fun gadget and has a nice screen and good sound quality for its size, which is great for photos but you need to tell Alexa 20 times a day to display them manually if you want to see them fullscreen as it_ not a setting you can change.",11

I was really looking for the ability to only show a clock at night, like the echo show 5, but the echo show 8 doesn_ have or allow that ability.

3,"Software isn't ready for prime time
  
",8.Dec.19,Yes,"The main complaint is the apps just don't work. Hulu TV gives an error message. I signed up for Food Network TV so that I could use one of the Show 8's in the kitchen, but it has no ability to do any of the live shows. It's sorta like Samsung and Apple TV's Food Network app, just some old recorded shows. Overall, it's just a larger screen that has Alexa and tells time, weather, etc. Touchscreen doesn't seem to work as well as the Show 5. I wonder if the largest Show has a glass screen. That might be why it's so expensive. The 1MP camera doesn't bother me as I don't use the video chat feature as I usually just use FaceTime. Sound is a bit better than the 5.UPDATE: I used the Amazon Trade-in Program where they give you X amount of money for an older Alexa device so long as your device isn't cracked. I traded in a Dot. The trade in amount was a mere $5. When they got it, they appraised it at $2 so I only got $2. I wasn't expecting that. My friend traded in his Echo. They told him it'd be $25. They sent it back to him without explanation and they kept his power supply. He spent 40 minutes on the phone being transferred to 3 people to finally get a resolution. Long story short. They do not explain why they refuse items or lower your value. Do NOT use the Trade-in program.Oh and the other issue with the Show 8 is it is very slow compared to the 5.",3

(I bought 3)  After spending 1 hour I can confirm the _ost helpful review here is completely false and _hings to try cannot be turned off in any way.

2,"As of 12/9/19, Reviews stating Things to Try can be removed are WRONG!
  
",9.Dec.19,Yes,"12/9/19I ordered the Show 8 based on reviews that said the ""Things to Try"" chryon could be disabled via the settings menu. As it turns out, that was incorrect information as has now been confirmed by Amazon customer support, as well as my own personal experience. I hope Amazon will listen to their customers and offer an option to disable this device behavior. Similar to an unsubscribe or opt-out of email setting, Amazon could offer a frequency option  (turn off, once a month, weekly, daily, hourly, on continuously). This one behavior truly ruins an otherwise good experience. If this is corrected, this device would earn 4-5 stars no question.Pros: Good sound, bright display, nice form factor, looks nice on the kitchen counter where I have it placed. Nice to have lyrics display while music is playing, local content is appreciated, good microphones, and I like the ability to see my cameras in the screen and the ability to view my home automation control (browser), physical camera shutter for privacy.Cons: Inability to turn off ""Things to Try"" is annoying, the optional stand should be less expensive, it could use more user options for what is displayed and how, and with Amazon having their own Silk browser, we should be able to at a minimum use voice to launch the browser with a saved bookmark. (e.g. ""Alexa, open bookmark My Favorite Website in Silk""  or better yet a routine that can open websites, so we could use natural language of our choosing, ""Alexa, show me XYZ."" .  Eventually, it would be nice to have natural language voice and/or gesture controlled browsing. Personal preference, I wish the closed shutter was more subtle (e.g. dark red or gray dot VS white on the black Echo show)",8

The Show 8 is not like the Show 5. It WILL NOT display a large clock with the date AT ALL. What were you thinking Amazon? It's bad enough you're not responding to user complaints with the try whatever garbage in every screen. Now you took away the clock? EPIC FAIL!! I would NOT recommend the Show 8 to anyone.

It's perfect for viewing my Blink cameras inside and outside of our home while I'm in bed.  The size is just perfect for my nightstand.  It has a small footprint, but big enough to see and use the screen clearly.The other 5 I have in my office.  Again, this has a big enough screen for all my uses.

I do like the Alexa stuff though I have all of them,  this one just fell a little short.One more thing, the search engine for alexa has alot to be desired, I wish it were something other then Bing it has a problem finding a lot of things on the web.  Definitely not Google.",0

",9.Dec.19,Yes,"This echo show is not worth it. the only upgrade over my older echo dot is the screen. but the screen comes with its own disadvantages. hate the ""try skills"", more advertising than real use. cant switch off the feature. the sound quality is about the same.update: i got the echo show during black Friday. following Tuesday amazon started advertising the echo show ships with a free echo dot for the same price, i called back to see if i get that and they said i need to cancel send it back and reorder. my card will be charged and then refunded...i feel amazon polices are going downhill every passing day.update: i regret trading echo spot. echo spot could control my firetv. echo can not do that.",10
5,"Love it
  
",10.Dec.19,Yes,Bought an Echo Show 5 earlier in the year. Was using in the kitchen and I liked it. Wanted one for the bedroom. When the new 8 was introduced I decided to order that for the kitchen and move the 5 to the bedroom. Loving the 8. Nice screen display which I have displaying a slide show of my photo galleries. Sound is much richer than the 5. Subtle differences vs the 5. The 8 is more refined and seems to offer more display options. Works well with my Wyze camera system. I currently have 6 Wyze cameras inside and outside of our home. Can view any of them upon voice request. Nice feature. Very happy with the purchase.,0
3,"""Try this"" -- Light bleeding -- customization
  
",10.Dec.19,Yes,"I am also not happy with the ""try this"" words at the bottom of the screen. It just doesn't fit the screen. Imagine if your phone constantly had that on it. It's just annoying. Also those who want to use this as an alarm clock-- the night time mode is too bright. Keeps your room relatively lit. The numbers and the fact it is not an AMOLED causes alot of light bleeding. Amazon please provide a AMOLED screen version. This will make a world of a difference. Lastly customization, there is little to none. You cant move the clock or select a different clock. You are stuck with the default. This thing has alot of potential, however the software isn't there to back it up.",3
3,"FUNCTIONALITY CHANGED...
  
",10.Dec.19,Yes,"I bought these units to use primarily as music/clocks in various rooms.  The Echo Show 5 has a GREAT clock/weather/date display; however, they really nerfed Echo 8; the time is in the upper corner of the screen, no date.  Still can't get rid of the ""TRY..."" feature.  Really expected an upgrade from 5 (which I own) but fell short.  Returning.",2
4,"Great with a few 'buts' because it's new
  
",10.Dec.19,Yes,"I love Echo, I had the original and finally was expanding automation to the whole house. As a whole this product is a great addition to the product line BUT it clearly is fleshing out issues.1) Doesn't listen as actively as the traditional echo. Has missed and misheard a lot.2) you have to update the settings or the screen will make you feel like it has some type of spastic disorder. The standard view moves too fast and tries too hard to tell you too much until you fix it.3) I have had a few weird issues technically with the product connecting to Amazon music or connecting my phone. They feel like software issues that will work themselves out, but this clearly is still a new product not running on the same backbone as Show 5.",0
3,"Stop with the Things to Try!
  
",10.Dec.19,Yes,"I really wanted to like the Echo 8, but I can_. The things to try at the bottom of the screen are beyond annoying and border on stupid. And trust me when I tell you that, with the Echo 8, there is NO WAY to turn this off.Three stars for the things it can do well, but please allow those of us who care about aesthetics to TURN THIS OFF!",1
5,"This Simplifies My Life
  
",10.Dec.19,Yes,"I received my Echo Show 8 today and it's already set up and I'm very happy with it. I bought a second one, as well, to give to my mother for Christmas. I intend to buy security cameras very soon to work with Alexa, and I just purchased smart bulbs to use in my home. I also have a 43"" TCL Roku Smart TV, which I can control, to some degree, with Alexa. I'm still figuring it out, but I've been able to switch from antenna TV, and open my Hulu app on the TV through Alexa. I haven't tried asking for a specific show or channel to play, but Alexa should be able to do those commands. The Echo is in my kitchen and the TV is in my bedroom, and they communicate just fine.I was in the cleaning mood tonight, and have been listening to some great Motown through the Echo Show 8 from my Amazon Music account. I'm impressed with the speakers and clarity. They're not top of the line, but they sound great, not at all tinny.I also noticed that when I turned the lights down, the Echo automatically went into a standby mode, blank with just the time showing. The music continued to play, however. When I turned the lights back on, it woke up again, displaying song lyrics, etc. Oh, and even with the music up at its loudest, I am able to give Alexa a command without having to yell, even from across the room.The Echo does continually show suggestions at the bottom of the screen, which some people have complained about. I pretty much ignore it because I'm not usually staring at the screen for it to bother me. While it's just sitting there, it will also go through news headlines. There may be a way to change these features, but I haven't yet explored that possibility.I did, also, ask Alexa to open Hulu and started watching a show directly on the Echo, just to test it out. It worked well, and the picture looked good. I just had to sign into Hulu on the Amazon Alexa app.There's still much to learn, but overall, I can see the Echo Show 8 being a helpful and fun part of my everyday routine. I asked Alexa to set a reminder alarm, which she did, and that's going to be a huge help for me. Once I get security cameras and the lights put up, I'll be set. I resisted getting any kind of ""Smart"" device for a while, but I'm glad I finally got the Echo. I'm always looking things up on my phone, or setting alarms to remind me to do things, so this just makes staying informed and organized so much easier. I will probably get another Echo Show 8 for my room after I get the security cameras so I can check them without having to go into the kitchen.I scooped up my Echo Show 8 and my mother's during the Black Friday sale on Amazon, so I couldn't resist the price. I also got Echo Dots for my four grown daughters, and will see how they like them.UPDATE: I thought this was great. I asked Alexa for the number to Fed Ex, which she found. Then she asked if I'd like her to call them for me. I talked to Fed Ex through Alexa and the call was clear. After the call, I said, ""Alexa, hang up."" And that was it! I didn't have to pick up my phone or search for the number. I love my Echo!",1

Also why do people have to jump through hoops and navigate all over the web to find someone to guide them so the annoying suggestions get removed from lower part of the screen.  Stop making it so difficult for people to remove your advertising. We already purchased the item, stop using it to try to sell your stuff, its not right.

I saw this screen version at my mother-in-law's home and knew I needed to add it to the mix, and boy am I glad I did. Not only do I continue to get all of the information/music/trivia I enjoy daily, but now I have a readout of the questions I've asked (just to make sure Alexa understands me) and of the information she offers me. I've also enjoyed the Art background that scrolls throughout the day, so in effect I get to visit my favorite art museums without having to travel any farther than my den chair. The quality of the screen images is superb, and the voice quality is sharp and clear. A great addition to the home!",0

It should have the option to display a cam on the home screen at all times!

But nope you really can't remove these messages.  They are on the bottom of every screen.  It is unbelievably annoying.  You think you should get use to it but you don't.There are complaints all over the web about this yet Amazon has done nothing.  Amazon if you read these messages let me give you a tip.  These messages don't make me more likely to use services they make me less likely.  I don't read the messages, I try to ignore them.Since Amazon is disregarding the input from users, the only option is to not buy the device and return the ones bought for a refund until Amazon adds the ability to turn these messages off.  Nobody buys a screen to be forced to watch ads.  Amazon if these messages truly added value then customers will leave them enabled on their screen.  The fact that you don't provide an option to turn them off indicates you realize they don't add value.I'm returning mine I suggest everyone simply think twice before you purchase one.  It truly is frustrating beyond belief that there is no way to disable these messages from the home screen.",6

Having a bigger screen than my phone is great when looking at how to videos.The goods:Screen size is great for videos, timers, pics, etc...The visual feed back after asking for automation is niceLooks good with or without the stand. Stand allows you to tilt it back a bit moreSound quality is hard to talk about because audio preferences are different for everybody and what they're accustomed to.The not so bad or deal breakers:Doesn't have the same screensaver options as the 5, really liked the turntable clock.Speaker is a little bass heavy out the box but adjustable.  Alexa's voice is deeper than the echo's",0

",12.Dec.19,Yes,"We personally LOVE the echo show! We stayed away at first because of the reviews about the _ds it_ shows- but honestly there_ nothing inconvenient about them! I like that world wide things come across the screen, when our packages will/have been delivered, news and suggestions of _ry, Alexa.... and comes up with with different ways to use Alexa! The music plays really well on it, i love being able to ask Alexa to play music while I do dishes or cleaning around the house, especially when i can ask her to play a specific song! Even the suggestions on _earn how to make this food! Which gives us more suggestions on foods I haven_ even thought about. Plus the weather for the day and just minor things Alexa can do! I think it_ great it rotates with different things and we can still see the time at the top corner. I_e been recommending it to everyone!

To my surprise, that was the response I received.I am very disappointed because that was not the case and I can't get anyone to listen to me or verify. I am not in a good place. I would suggest not going the trade-in route, you don't know how you will end up.",0
5,"Much better than the 5 inch
  
",13.Dec.19,Yes,"I bought the 5 inch on Prime day. I like it. It's a great bedside clock and it does things that need a screen, like finding a book or music playlist. But the screen is small. The 8 seemed huge when I opened the box. Just huge. But it's a very nice screen, and very suitable for the free Prime Video stuff. I think the overall experience is getting better. With the screen, I can find Audible books fairly easily. The books synch  pretty well with my smartphone. I like that there is no downloading, they just stream. A lot of the videos that come up are interesting. You can hone things to what you want like the stock market or NFL scores, etc. If I want to hear a song, I can generally just ask for it, but it helps to have the Unlimited service, not the free one. Sometimes when I ask for a shopping suggestion, I get really good and in-depth information. But not always. I use it in the kitchen, so it's great for timers and I'd like to find good recipes. It was worth it, for me. Honestly, my $25 Dot seems pretty worthless now. The Dot had decent audio, but this is quite good. My outdoor video cameras come up OK on the Alexa Fire device, but not so smooth on the Echos.",0

",13.Dec.19,Yes,"I got this since it was on sale on Black Friday and so far I love it. I was already familiar with Alexa so it was very easy to set up, especially for a grandmother!  At first when I was getting in bed I thought the screen was too bright and busy for sleeping but when I turned off the light, it went very dim and the only thing showing was the clock and it was bigger so I could see it. But not so much to keep me awake. So the ""night mode"" for me is a great feature but I do like the simple things. The suggestions at the bottom do not bother me like it does some. The reason why I gave only 4 stars on sound quality was because it gives off almost an echo when Alexa talks, unlike my Echo Dot. But I am sure I can play with that a bit.",0

I made the mistake of setting up initially with my phone and email thinking I could easily edit it later. That was a huge mistake! It required a couple of lengthy phone calls to Amazon to get my cell phone number disassociated and their number associated.Also, on one of those calls, I had the person tell me that my Amazon account and my Alexa account are linked. They are not!If you don_ want to give access to all your phone_ contact, you can set up contacts separately but it_ not at all intuitive. It took me a while to figure it out.

I suppose I could shout at Alexa from across  the room to ask for the time and date for but it is not worth the breathe when you could otherwise just glance at it.  This is like a large size down grade.  I may return it unless I get a response from someone at Amazon telling me there is going to be a quick fix for this soon.After giving this a negative review, I received a call from Amazon Customer Service.  While I may not be in love with my Echo Show 8, I really love Amazon and their customer service.  The Echo 8 is growing on me.  I will not be returning it.

I have it where my handicapped wife can see it and I can use drop in to check on her.  She was bothered by the changing screen.  The fact that I could turn that off made it great for our purposes.

Maybe there is a way to set that upAdding skills it does not let you just type in the skill.For example say I want to look at a recipe;  the ""rotate continuously"" means I get about 10 secounds to memorize the recipe  --OR-- go into settings; find the button; change the button; get the recipe ; then change it all back;and then there are the privacy issues ....and no support from Amazon.",2

",14.Dec.19,Yes,Great product and screen size! Easy setup and user friendly. Would recommend to anyone!,0
5,"Great Purchase, I_ Impressed!!!!
  
",14.Dec.19,Yes,"I got an Echo Show 8 and the RING 2 Doorbell/Echo Show 5 deals for Black Friday, and have been impressed with all 3 items!  Both Echo Show devices have much better sound quality than the Echo Dots that I already owned, and the Dot has pretty good sound.  The Echo Show 8 elevates the sound quality of music, and has much deeper bass because of the speaker size.  The picture quality is great, I often have Hulu playing in it while folding clothes.  Great picture quality when I ask to see the camera from the Ring!  I often read reviews about Amazon ads on Echo Show devices, and I haven_ experienced a single one!",0
5,"great for kitchen
  
",14.Dec.19,Yes,"I had an original echo speaker I used for streaming music.  It spends most of its time in the kitchen area.  I decided to upgrade for the additional features.  It delivers, except the volume is not as loud as with the original echo speaker.  Perhaps because I have it sitting on the counter.  I have ordered a stand, maybe that will enhance the volume.  I am satisfied with the show.  For my screen saver I personalized it with Amazon photos.  Everyone who comes into the kitchen wants t linger if not for the music for the photos.  It helps me get through mundane tasks like cleaning the stove as it also connects with Amazon Prime videos.  I recommend this product to everyone.",0
5,"Easy to Use, Significant Improvement Over Echo Show 5
  
",14.Dec.19,Yes,"I have 3 Show 5 models in the house. Sound is nice, not great, and screen is too small for pleasant viewing. I find the Echo Show 8 to be a significant upgrade in terms of sound quality and visual experience. Those extra 3 inches make a difference for casual viewing. While the first 3 models took about 15 minutes to set up, this one, perhaps following the defaults I already established on my Echo 5 models, was ready to go in 3 minutes, rather amazing. We are using this model in the kitchen, and I have a feeling my twins are going to want one in their room. This has been quite a transition for me since I am a lifelong ""radio guy"" making the switch to Amazon Echo-tainment systems. Recommended",0
5,"Beats Google Nest Hub because it has a browser and a few more features.
  
",14.Dec.19,Yes,"I have both the Google Nest Hub (7 inch display) and the Amazon Echo show 5 and 7.  There were a few things that reviews online did not emphasized and actually place Google as the winner between the 2 and I have a different opinion because of the following.  I think Echo show is a better option for some because of the following...1.  Echo Show 8 has a bigger screen than Google Nest Hub.  Echos Show 5 is about $20 less the Google Nest Hub.2.  Contrary to beliefs, Echo Show 5 and 8 are capable of showing YouTube videos via the Firefox Browser.3.  Echo Show 5 and 8 have 2 accessible web browsers.  Google Nest Hub does not have an accessible web browser, which you can use to view websites.4.  If you have Amazon Prime, you can watch Amazon Prime videos.  You can't on Google Nest Hub. (Althouth you can watch youtube tv on the Google Hub, which you can also do on the Echo show 5 and 8.5.  You can also link your Hulu Service to Amazon Echo 5 and 8 and watch Hulu on it.  You can not watch Hulu on Google Nest Hub.  Although there are some workarounds on casting from device to device.  You are better off just getting a streaming service device on your television than have it cast and bog down your wifi.  I have both Google and Amazon infrstructures at my smart home.  I like Google as well, but Amazon Echo show proved to be more useful for my needs.",0
5,"Works great
  
",14.Dec.19,Yes,"I love all the Echo products. I started with the little disc ones and now have progressed to the Echo 8 with one in each room  I like that when you use the Ambiant noise, the fabulous choices come on the screen for selection with Amazon Prime. Good sound for everyday radio talk, and very convenient to be in any room and be able to ask time, weather, recipes, talk radio, music streaming or meditation mode. There is an off camera button to slide on top as well as a sleep mode that will sense when the room goes dark and dim down for sleep. Alexa still has a lot to learn, over all this is a great price for all she does.",0
5,"Great device
  
",14.Dec.19,Yes,I love the Echo Show.  I have two Echo's already and this is a great additions.  I can play music in all rooms at the same time and it is so much fun to make a video call.,0
5,"ECHO SHOW.....getting used to it
  
",14.Dec.19,Yes,"I recently added the 8 inch Echo Show to my home accessories of 2 existing Echos, a dot and standard configuration.  I located the Show in our dinning nook so that we could see the camera coverage and also use it for timers, information and music. I had difficulty synching the show with my ARLO cameras but eventually got things working correctly.  Overall it is a fun device and I am still discovering what it can do.  It creeps out my wife a bit for she feels that not only can Alexa now hear us but also sees us.",0
5,"Great sound quality and excellent audio/video
  
",14.Dec.19,Yes,"I was very impressed by this unit. We have a fire cube, echo plus and several echos. This unit is by far the most versatile and user friendly of all units. The screen is surprisingly great quality and the sound is close in comparison to the echo plus. I_ glad I eith with the 8 screen over the 5. It does a great job quickly linking to cameras and the rest of our smart home devices.",0
2,"_ry This... NEEDS to be turned off
  
",14.Dec.19,Yes,"I_e never had an echo show before, but I_e had plenty of echoes, but this one is beautiful in appearance, bright beautiful screen that has so many options, but the one detractor that is ruining the device is the constant rotation of _ry this over and over and over again. Ruining the device for so many Amazon customers. This feature needs to have an option to turn off for this product to be a five-star product.  Also there are no options for different clocks to rotate, just whatever the default is set by Amazon. There should be options like an Apple Watch that you can pick different time themes to your taste. That_ another detraction. Fix these issues and you will make many happy Amazon customers!",1
5,"Better than expected
  
",14.Dec.19,Yes,"Sound is better than expected, better than our original 1st gen Echo. We use it for recipes and all the other things we used original for. Adding screen makes quite a difference",1
2,"Unexpectedly annoying and not as expected
  
",14.Dec.19,Yes,The clock function on this is terrible. It only shows up in a tiny font on the upper left corner of the screen and the temperature is even smaller.  It is constantly changing so it's beyond distracting.  I purchased this thinking that it would be a larger version of the Show 5.  It definitely is not.  I'm very unhappy with this.,2
4,"Fill sound and display
  
",14.Dec.19,Yes,The sound was better than what I expected. It sounds very nice with a full sound. Not tinny at all. The mic is not as sensitive as my previous echo. it would be nice to change what type of news appears on the home screen. Very happy with my purchase.,0
5,"excellent! we love it
  
",14.Dec.19,Yes,"wow! i got this for my wife but we all love it. i can check the video doorbell, and even make regular phone calls on it. sound quality is amazimg, picture is clear, ease of use and set up is a breeze.the only thing i would change is the little ""try saying..."" things that stay on bottom of screen on home page",1
3,"still learning
  
",14.Dec.19,Yes,"Y0u can go online and research its capabilities.  You can play with the screen, but if you really want to learn anything and how to make the most out of this item - order the how to book.  I also bought one of these for an elderly aunt  to help me stay in touch and physically see her and the only way this will work is to provide actual written instructions.  One so I can see it and two so I can help here reference particular pages and paragraphs.",0

1,"Not ready for prime time!
  
",15.Dec.19,Yes,"I actually dislike all of versions of the show as they all have the annoying ""Try Alexa"" screen that you can't get rid of.  If they allowed you to get rid of that, this would be a five star review.  Unfortunately, I don't ever see that changing.  My other big complaint is the clock.  The 8"" version is right in between the 5"" and the 10"", but the time is really small in the upper right corner and cannot be changed like the 5"" version.  Amazon should have the same options as the 5"" versions.  I just want this as a larger clock during the day.  However, you almost need glasses to see the time from a distance as it is way too small.  They really did not think this echo show out.  Designers of this really need to go back to the drawing board and rethink this one out before updating the next version of software.  I will probably end up sending this one back and waiting for them to fix these issues if they ever do before purchasing again.  In the mean-time, I would stay with the 5"" or the 10"" for now.  The sound is good, but the 10"" is still better.  BTW, for those of you who do want to use this in a bedroom on a nightstand next to your bed, beware that dark mode is so bright that it will pretty much light up the room with a warm glow.  There really is no way to get this screen to dim past a certain point.  Still pretty bright.",0
1,"Not so great.
  
",15.Dec.19,Yes,"I don't know what Amazon is trying to do with this device. You can't watch Hulu Live, YouTube TV or any other live TV. You can watch Prime Video, Hulu or NBC shows with commercials but not NBC live TV. For regular YouTube you have to use a browser.Why have a screen if you can't watch streaming services you subscribe to?If you want an Alexa device don't get the show models.",4

1,"No Music While Using Web Browser
  
",15.Dec.19,Yes,"I purchased this to use in the kitchen. If that is your intention, you need to know that the All Recipes Skill is utter garbage. There is absolutely no way for you to link your account so you won_ have access to your personal or saved recipes. Instead they will give you a few options to choose from. That_ useless to me. I finally figured out a way to access my personal recipes by using the web browser instead of using a skull. This would have been a minor inconvenience that I could live with except for one major issue. The Echo Show won_ play music and allow you to use the web browser at the same time. I always listen to music while cooking so this is an absolute deal breaker for me. It blows my mind that Amazon would design such a limited device as this when the top use of their devices is streaming music. This device doesn_ meet our needs in the least. I guess I will go back to using a tablet to look at my recipes while streaming music over a Dot. What a shame. I really thought Amazon was better than this. They really dropped the ball on what could have been a great device.",3
5,"Adds the height &amp; tilt I needed but no screen rotation
  
",15.Dec.19,Yes,"I wish I had shopped around a little more before purchasing this.  It does add height, the ability to tilt the screen,  and a little more completeness to its posture, but it would be nice to have where I could turn the screen a bit.  It fits perfectly &amp; is held in place magnetically.  The tilt is great, the ability to rotate the screen even a little would make it perfect.",0

",15.Dec.19,Yes,"Received it a bit delayed compared with Amazon stds.  Sort of challenging to figure out.  Still developing it's ""skills"", etc.  But was able to link it to my calendar (sort of) and contacts.  Nice screen.  Seems like you have to sync it up with a phone ""app"" of alexa.  Sort of links to pc but... not really. ?",1
4,"Almost perfect.
  
",15.Dec.19,Yes,"So I_l get the two flaws out of the way first. First is the same thing most people don_ like... the non stop _sk Alexa... prompts written across the bottom of the screen. There_ no way to turn them off. And they_e annoying and kinda tacky. Like we already drank the Alexa Kool Aid, stop trying to sell us. But anyway besides that it_ great. I_ apple products through and through. Then I got an echo dot with my fire stick purchase and we loved it. I have a ring doorbell, so I wanted it to work with that, and auto show me the doorbell instead of having to look at our phones. And it works great, kind of. You still have to say _lexa show me the front door. Kind of frustrating that it_ already communicating with the doorbell. It rings and tells you someone_ at the door. Why can_ it auto show the camera feed when someone rings? Hopefully a future update. But all other aspects of it are great. Screen looks great. It sounds great. It_ the perfect side to be by my front door table. Super easy to set up. Just fix those 2 things!!",1
5,"No brained for kitchen/downstairs entertainment areas. Newsy is underrated for headlines.
  
",15.Dec.19,Yes,"Unbelievable value especially when purchased during a sale. Sound could be a little more crisp. I_ torn with this and the new studio in the downstairs main living areas. I want the features of the echo show in the kitchen entertaining areas, but I want the huh end sound of the studio for playing loud music. I ended up adding the sub to this and overall it_ good. But I wish the sound was a little bit higher in quality. I would purchase again if I could. I_e even purchased as a gift for family members.",0
4,"A good device
  
",15.Dec.19,Yes,V good device.,0
4,"Good job, but...
  
",15.Dec.19,Yes,"Was very impressed with the ease of set up. Easier than the dot. Color is good and clear. Sound is good, but can get a little ""tinny"" at upper levels. I am disappointed that you can not run a separate visual and audio. For instance, run audible and have the fireplace on visually. I would think that would be part of the perks of having the  show. Perhaps I missed something? You can, as usual, run a timer or alarm and other things. Overall, I am very pleased.",0
3,"Amazon fix the Home Screen Try, ""Alexa . . . "" notification. Allow user to turn this off.
  
",15.Dec.19,Yes,"Would be a five star review if Amazon would provide a way to turn off the very annoying _ry, _cho . . ._ that is alway rotating on the home screen. Come on Amazon, a software fix allowing deselection of this _eature would make many more of your customers happy as this seems to be the number 1 complaint in the reviews. Looking forward to a fix so I can change my rating to the 5 stars the device deserves.",1
3,"Too bright for sleeping, even in night mode
  
",16.Dec.19,Yes,"A fun unit but produces too much light even in night mode. I have to tell Alexa to turn off the display when I sleep, which means enduring the brighter non-night mode if I wake early and want to see the time. I_l likely use this elsewhere in the house and go back to the echo show 5. Don_ know why they couldn_ make the same clock settings for both.",2
2,"Defective Unit
  
",16.Dec.19,Yes,"Apparently Amazon is having problems with their Echo Show 8 which is why I'm having to wait until after Christmas for my second Echo Show 8. The one I got today was defective right out of the box.I have to admit I was very surprised and sadden as I love my Echo Show 5 which works like a champ. I'm not sure why a larger version should have problems but I wish now I'd bought another Echo Show 5 instead as I would have a working unit for my living room now instead of a defective one.The problem seems to be the software. It keeps hanging up and the only way around it is to disconnect the power and then repower the unit and hope you can get through the part that hung up on you before. One menu required moving my finger up, to scroll down, instead of the usual moving the finger down to scroll down. That was totally weird.I am disappointed because I ordered the two Echo Shows as my main Christmas presents to myself. I wanted the 10s but I read they weren't very good for the almost double price. And the 8 is really big enough for what I want it to do--if it would do it.So my Christmas tree isn't going to have much under it this year which is a shame as this will probably be my last Christmas due to cancer. At least the Echo Show, due after Christmas, is from a different batch so maybe it will work right out of the box like my Echo 5.",0
5,"Handier than I thought
  
",16.Dec.19,Yes,"Bought the set for the deal and my spouse needing something to play thunderstorms for him at night.  Didn't realize how easy and addictive the tool would become in our every day life.

1,"Great but the home screen is not customizable for the Show 8
  
",16.Dec.19,Yes,Does what it says. My complaint is the home screen and the inability to do any customization. It has a little clock and scrolls through skill suggestions. annoying and returned because of it.,2
2,"THIS PRODUCT IS NOT READY FOR PRIME TIME!
  
",16.Dec.19,Yes,"EVERYTHING IS CONTROLLED BY YOUR MOBIL ALEXA APP.  IT NEEDS A MAJOR UPGRADE, YET REMAINS THE SAME.  THE MAJOR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT I ASSUMED THE LATEST GENERATION OF ECHO SHOW WOULD PROVIDE WAS AT LEAST THE SAME FUNCTIONALITY AS MY MUCH OLDER ECHO  2ND GEN ECHO TOWER.  IT IS TWO YEAR OLD NOW BUT PICKS UP YOUR VOICE TEN TIMES BETTER THAN ANY ECHO SHOW, WHICH EXPLAINS EVEN THEIR PRIMARY ECHO' SHOW'S LOW RATINGS.WHAT IS MOST ANNOYING IS MY COMMANDS TO TURN ON A PARTICULAR DEVICE WILL APPEAR TO BE ACCEPTED AND COMPLETED AS THE ECHO SHOW SHUTS OFF, BUT THE LIGHT I TOLD HER TO TURN ON IS STILL UNLIT.  I HAVE TO AGAIN ASK HER TO DO THE SAME THING AND THEN IT COMES ON.  I HAVE MANY ECHO LIGHTS, PLUGS, AND OTHER DEVICES.  MY ATTEMPTS TO TRIGGER MULTIPLE FUNCTIONS TO OCCUR BY GIVING ALEXA A COMMAND RARELY WORKS.  I HAVE ALSO NOTICES THAT THE DEVICES WITH AMAZON PLUGS THAT WERE TURNED OFF HOURS EARLIER WILL SUDDENLY BE FOUND ON, WITHOUT EXPLANATION.  HAVING TO REPEAT THE SAME COMMAND TWO TIMES BEFORE IT TURNS ON OR OFF IS REALLY ANNOYING!  I WENT INTO THE ALEXA APP AND DELETED ANY PRIOR USE OF SKILLS AND CAN NO LONGER FIND ANY THAT HAVE NOT BEEN DELETED.  YET I STILL WILL COME HOME TO FIND DEVICES (MOSTLY LIGHTS) THAT ARE SUDDENLY ON AS IF SHE IS ACTIVATING THEM AT A PREDETERMINED TIME.  YOU WILL FIND THAT ANY DEVICE THAT IS NOT MADE BY AMAZON, BUT IS COMPATIBLE WITH ALEXA, MUST BE USED TO ACTIVATE THAT PLUG OR LIGHT.  I HAVE SMART-THINGS, KASA, ETC.  THEY MUST BE USED TO CONNECT THEIR DEVICE TO YOUR HOME NETWORK. ONCE THEY ARE WORKING PROPERLY, ALEXA CAN BE USED TO ADD THEM BUT WHAT IS NEEDED IS ONE CENTRAL ICON THAT CONTROLS EVERYTHING.  I'VE HAD SO MANY PROBLEMS TRYING TO USE THE VOICE COMMAND WITH ALEXA WITHOUT HAVING TO REPEAT IT 2-3 TIMES BEFORE A LIGHT GOES OFF THAT I'M READY TO SEND THE THING BACK.  THE LEARNING CURVE FOR ALEXA IS MUCH GREATER THAN IT NEEDS TO BE.  THE TERMS THAT AMAZON USES TO DESCRIVE CERTAIN FUNCTIONS ARE JUST NOT COMMON AND I WOULD NEVER REMEMBER TO SAY THEM IN ORDER FOR ALEXA TO TURN LIGHTS ON AND BEGIN PROVIDING THE DAILY WEATHER, NEWS ETC.  RATHER AN REQUESTING SHE PROVIDE YOUR MORNING NEWS AS SELECTED WHEN IT WAS SET UP, I HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT ITS NOT THE NEWS, ITS MY ""FLASH BRIEFING"".  WHEN I FIRST WAKE UP, I CAN'T REMEMBER TO USE A PHRASE THAT I'VE NEVER USED IN MY LIFE AND JUST ISN'T SOMETHING THAT SEEMS NECESSARY.  IF THEIR AI WAS A ONE FIRMWARE UPGRADE UP, ALEXA SHOULD ALLOW ME TO NAME MY ""SKILL"" WHICH IS ANOTHER WORD THAT JUST DOESN'T FIT THE PROCESS BEING PROGRAMMED.  FINALLY, ALEXA IS FAR FROM BEING READY FOR PRIME TIME BUT SIRI OR HEY GOOGLE ARE NO BETTER.  WHAT BOTHERS ME IS THE ECHO MODEL (SPECIFICALLY THE ECHO SHOW) HAS ITS VISUAL BENEFITS, HOWEVER, TO GAIN THOSE BENEFITS I FEEL I HAVE LOST THE BASIC FUNCTIONALITY OF MY FORMER ECHO TOWER.  WHEREVER THEY PLACED THE MICROPHONE ON THE ECHO SHOW, UNLIKE THE ROUND ECHO TOWER THAT PICKS UP YOUR VOICE FROM ANY DIRECTION, THE ECHO SHOW CAN ONLY HEAR FROM THE FRONT OF THE UNIT.  IF THE TELEVISION IS ON, SHE WILL RARELY GET THAT I SAID CORRECTLY ALTHOUGH I AM SPEAKLING LOUDLY AND CLEARLY.  I CAN'T PROVIDE A REMINDER UNLESS I GO THROUGH FOUR STEPS. FORST TO NOTIFY ALEXA THAT I HAVE A NEW REMINDER, SHE WILL ASK WHAT IT IS BUT I CANNOT PROVIDE HER WHAT THE REMINDER IS  WHILE ALSO TELLING HER THE DATE AND TIME.  SHE WILL IGNORE IT EVERYTHING BUT WHAT THE REMINDER IS AND THEN ASK ME WHEN WHAT DATE AND TIME OF THE REMINDER.  I A POSITIVE I NEVER HAD TO DO THAT IN THE PAST.  SHE responds FROM HER ONLY RECORDING WHATEVER THE REMINDER IS BUT I MUST WAIT FOR HER TO ASK FOR THE DATE AND TIME.  I DON'T REMEMBER HAVING TO DO THAT WITH MY ALEXA ECHO TOWER???  IT TAKES SO MANY STEPS, I STOPPED USING IT.  APPARENTLY THE ALEXA APP ON MY PHONE IS THE PRIMARY BRAINS BUT EVERY ALEXA DEVICE IS NOT CREATED EQUALLY AND THE SOFTWARE THAT DRIVES IT IS UNIQUE TO THE DEVICE.  I HAVE EVEN BEGUN TO USE ANY OF THE FEATURES THE ECHO SHOW IS KNOWN FOR.  I AM CURIOUS AS TO WHY THE ECHO SHOW WANTS TO DEFAULT TO CONNECTING VIA BLUETOOTH WHEN WI-FI HAS SUCH GREATER DISTANCE.  IF I ASK ALEXA A QUESTION SUCH AS, ""DO YOU KNOW WHEN THE HEISMAN TROPHY PRESENTATION WILL BE BROADCAST ON TV""?  THAT REQUEST CAUSES HER TO GO INTO CONVULSIONS.  SHE DOESN'T HAVE A CLUE WHAT THE QUESTION WAS AND BEGINS GIVING ME A HISTORY LESSON OF WHEN THE HEISMAN TROPHY WAS FIRST INTRODUCED.  TRYING TO INTERRUPT HER TO SHUT HER UP IS NEAR IMPOSSIBLE.  SHE IS DEFINITELY FEMALE. LOL  NOW THAT SEVERAL CREDIBLE NEWS SOURCES HAVE REPORTED THAT AMAZON'S RINGER PRODUCT WHICH I HAVEN'T INSTALLED YET, BUT I'M ASSUMING THE VIDEO IT RECORDS IS UPLOADED TO THE AMAZON CLOUD.  HOWEVER, THOSE RECORDING SHOULD BE ENCRYPTED AND PRIVATE. THEY SHOULD NOT BE RELEASED TO ANYONE WITHOUT THE EXPRESS CONSENT OF THE OWNER. ABC NEWS REPORTED THAT POLICE WERE SELLING SOMETHING AND GIVING AWAY ALEXA RINGERS BECAUSE IT WILL PROVIDE THEM CAMERAS ALL OVER THE CITY. i'm NOT OPPOSED TO THIS AS AN INVESTIGATOR, BUT I DO NOT WANT IT PROVIDED AUTOMATICALLY TO ANYONE AND IF AMAZON DOES SO, THEY WILL RUE THE DAY, PERHAPS BY BEING OFFLINE FOR A FEW WEEKS!IF YOUR FORTY PAGE TERMS GIVE EMPLICIT PERMISSION TO DISTRIBUTE THE VIDEO. THEN I WILL HAVE NO ALTERNATIVE THAN TO RE-ENGINEER IT TO NO LONGER UPLOAD ANYTHING TO AN INSECURE CLOUD SERVICE.THAT WOULD BE A BLATANT INVASION OF PRIVACY AND RESULT IN WORSE PUBLIC EXPOSURE THAN AMAZON SEEMS TO RECEIVE EVERY DAY FROM VIOLATING THE RIGHTS OF THEIR CUSTOMERS TO ENRICH THEMSELVES OR SHARE WITH A CORRUPT FEDERAL ORGANIZATION.MY GUESS IS AMAZON WAS THREATENED BY THE NSA WITH THEIR ILLEGAL SURVEILLANCE OF YOUR CEO AND HAS NOW BECOME ANOTHER TECH WHORE EVENTUALLY BECOMING A COMPLETE WHORE LIKE GOOGLE AND THEIR PIMP THE NSA, CIA, AND OTHER AGENCIES THAT OPERATE OUTSIDE THE AUTHORITY OR OVERSIGHT OF ANYONE.  THE CIA ARE THE SAME PEOPLE WHO ARE SMUGGLING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN DRUGS FROM MEXICO USING TUNNELS THAT DOPEY HASN'T EVER THOUGHT OF. THE CIA HAS BEEN IN THE DRUG TRADE SINCE VIETNAM IN ORDER TO FUND THEIR BLACK OPS MISSIONS.  THOSE ACTIVITIES THEY DON'T WANT CONGRESS TO BE ABLE TO TRACE BY FOLLOWING THE MONEY.  THIS IS WHY THE ADMINISTRATION ONLY WANTS TO ERECT A WALL TO PREVENT MOSTLY CHILDREN AND WOMEN FROM INVADING OUR COUNTRY WHILE HIS 50 IQ GENIUS MIND IS CLUELESS AS TO THE HUNDREDS OF ELABORATE TUNNELS THAT EXIST BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES AND WHERE WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY TO REVEAL THEM AND SHUT THEM DOWN.  THIS IS PRIMARILY THE CIA BUT IS COMMON KNOWLEDGE TO MOST ANYONE WHO BOTHERS TO INVESTIGATE IT, EXCEPT FOR THE 98% OF AMERICA THAT IS SPOON FED EVERY DAY BY FOX CHILDRENS NETWORK.WHILE VERY LITTLE HAS EVER PROCEEDED OUT THE MOUTH OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE ASYLUM THAT EVEN RESEMBLES THE TRUTH, YET IT BECOMES WHAT THE MAJORITY BELIEVE. ""IT'S IGNORANCE GONE TO SEA!!""AFTER AMAZON WAS PASSED OVER FOR A 25 BILLION DOLLAR CONTRACT, I'm SURE THEY WERE ADVISED WHAT THEY NEEDED TO DO TO BE CONSIDERED THE NEXT TIME.  MONEY IS THE DRIVING FORCE.  AFTER THER WAS ZERO EXCUSE FOR ALEXA TO BE RECORDING WHEN NOT ACTIVATED AND AMAZON EMPLOYEES LISTENING TO RANDOM CONVERSATIONS WILL RESULT IN YET THE THIRD MAJOR CLASS ACTION PENDING LAWSUIT THAT I JUST REVIEWED FROM GACOVINO, LAKE, AND ASSOCIATES ""TOPCLASSACTIONS.COM""DUE TO THE NUMBER OF BUGS IN THE AMAZON ECHO SHOW 8, I WILL HAVE TO RETURN IT LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE THAT TOUCHES ON TECHNOLOGY GREATER THAN A FIFTH GRADE LEVEL.DON'T BUY THIS ERROR RIDDLED DEVICE!",1

",16.Dec.19,Yes,"It is the perfect size and the screen resolution is so nice! I also like the sound.What I dislike is as follows:- reaction time is slow. Sometimes it would need you to scroll several times in order to slide the pop up menu. I have installed a protector, so it might be something wrong with it, but doesn_ feel like it.- microphones are not as good as the ones on the echo plus or echo dot. Sometimes I have to repeat _lexa 3-4 times and I_ not kidding!- it is disappointing how you toggle between screens. So far haven_ been able to find a touch command that would minimize or allow me to alt+tab between screens. You have to request it each time.- paired with a Wyze camera it is pathetic. It lags so much that at some point it started buffering every 3 seconds. There is also e delay in the transmission of about 5-6 seconds.

",17.Dec.19,Yes,"Got the echo show 8 for my kitchen to keep me company while cooking , to face-to-face talk with my sister, to listen to music and look up recipes. I also have been using it as a weather reporter and a calculator. I also like the announcement feature.  Every day I_ finding more uses. So far I like it although it was a little confusing setting up the video calling. I would definitely recommend the echo show 8. It is a perfect size; any bigger and it would be intrusive on my countertop. Sound is decent; it_ no Bose, after all. I also have the echo show 5 that I use as an alarm clock, etc. in the bedroom. Love that one, too.",0

4,"Great sound
  
",17.Dec.19,Yes,I really liked this device. Only reason I didn't give a 5 star is because I wish I would put a timer for the background pictures.

3,"Show and tell feature no longer works!
  
",17.Dec.19,Yes,"I would have given this 5 stars but for one problem!  I bought this specifically because I wanted the show and tell feature because i am blind.  I am now being told that this feature has been removed and there's no reason why and not sure if it's going to come back.  I have been given such misinformation when I call Amazon's cucstomer support.  one person tells me it works on the 5-8-10 then i'm told it only works on the 10, and now being told it only works on the first and second gen, and lastly that it's been removed from all show devices.  I did all my research before I bought this product and even found videos on YouTube showing the echo show 8 with this feature enabled.  I'm so confused and frustrated!  I don't know whether I should just return this or wait and hope the next update  of software gets this feature back",0

",17.Dec.19,Yes,"My LCD clock in the family room is getting old and I was think about using this one as a nice replacement for it. I already have a couple of Echo Show 5"" in the kitchen and bedroom. What could go wrong with a bigger screen Echo Show ?! Well it turned out that I couldn't be more wrong that I'm now considering myself intelligently challenged compared to the super-smart Amazon people. Echo Show 5"" and 8"" are *totally* different !! With this big screen it does *NOT* allow you to choose the Clock Face. You only have a tiny clock showing on the 8"" screen. From the couch reading the time is like doing a vision exam at the eye doctor's office.So, I'm sorry, back you go. And good job, Amazon !",3

So, overall, a great device to get instead of a plain alexa speaker.",0
5,"Greater than the 5 by 3 HaHa
  
",17.Dec.19,Yes,"We had a Show 5 for awhile and loved it, this is even better with the larger screen, we love the whole Alexa system. Moved the 5 to the bedroom. This 8 is really great especially using our Ring doorbell and interacting with our Dish Network receiver.",0
5,"I love my Echo Show 8!!!
  
",18.Dec.19,Yes,"Bought this for myself. I already have an Echo Show and the Echo Show 5 and love them. The Echo Show 8 is a perfect compromise between the Echo Show and Echo Show 5. The larger 8 inch screen is great if you have poor eyesight and the sound quality is amazing for a device of this size. We started out placing an Echo in every room; now, we have Echo Shows in 3 of the 5. Amazon has done an excellent job continuing to update and add features to the Echo Show. And, what_ more, they play nicely with just about every product out there. I cannot say the same for the competition. We have a few of those devices as well. If you_e thinking about getting one of these, just do it! You won_ be disappointed. In a few weeks I_ sure I_l hear my family members saying that they love the Echo 8s we got them for Christmas!!",0

",18.Dec.19,Yes,"I bought the Show 8 on Black Friday, great price! After setting it up, and that was pretty simple, I wish that I had bought it for the bedroom also, I love my Dot 3, but having a Show 8 or 5 would have been more fun. The speakers on the Show 8 are excellent and they can be adjusted for Treble and Bass, The picture is fantastic and so clear. I have it set up in our Family Room, sitting on you Man Chair I can check the scores of my favorite teams, I can check the weather, see what's happening at the front door, check our front yard, and the patio cameras.The best thing about it, is when the TV is on loud watching a movie I can be anywhere in the room, give it a command, and it reacts instantly. The Show 8 was a great buy, and I will be purchasing more of them in the future.",1
5,"Bought this to go with Ring doorbell
  
",18.Dec.19,Yes,I bought the Show 8 to go with Ring doorbell.  Turns out its another echo with video.  the speakers are great with great sound.  The video is good.

5,"The goldilocks echo! Not too big, not too small, great sound.
  
",18.Dec.19,Yes,"I have 3 shows now. The 1st &amp; 2nd gen and now the 8. I love it! The screen is larger than the 1st gen and just a little smaller than the second. For the cost this is a great choice if you are trying to decide which is right for you. It sounds great. The screen is decent size to see photos on and is large enough to read the info I have set up for Alexa to show me throughout the day. I wanted another device to be able to add one in my art studio. The echo 8 delivered big! I would recommend and have bought some as gifts. IMO this is the _aby bear echo, it_ size is just right. Doesn_ take up too much room yet has a screen large enough to see from anywhere within the room. Job well done _ _",0
4,"Interface &amp; App Offerings Need Work
  
",18.Dec.19,Yes,"I like the Echo Show 8, but I find the interface clunky compared to the Cube and Fire TV Stick.  For instance, if I ask it to adjust the lights while watching a video, the light control screen comes up, and you have to start from the home screen to get back to your video.  Also, I can't seem to control the brightness of the screen by routine or voice command.  The lack of certain video services like Disney+ and Netflix is a definite drawback.  Its a new-ish product, and I have faith that Amazon will make improvements as it did with its other Echo products.",0

It_ not bad at this, but I_e had a hard time getting Alexa to search websites more broadly as Google does. Seems most focused on just a few food websites which limits its ability to find recipes I know exist (and would like to add to my favorites).All together a somewhat disappointing experience.",1

Drove myself a little nuts trying to set up bluetooth the old way through the phone not knowing there were settings onscreen that took care of that. I hate the ""Try this Skill"" suggestions but everything I found so far is an enhancement to the tall tube type Echo. I thought the Echo Dot was included but looking back Amazon wants to make sure you're paying attention and press a button to get one. If you're giving them away to Show 8 buyers then give everybody who orders a Show 8 a Dot. Bottom line is this is the best Echo so far and if you want an Alexa buy this one.",0

",19.Dec.19,Yes,"Echo Show 8 - HD 8"" smart display with Alexa is something that I bought specifically to watch the streams from my Wyze cameras.  It does that very well but it is the _ry, _lexa ----   feature that some people find annoying that I like so much that I purchased a second device.The screen changes with different news items or informational comments and across the bottom of the screen a tag line shows the exact phrasing to use if one wants to know more.  This helps to avoid frustration when struggling to phrase a question or command that Alexa will immediately understand.  The _ry, Alexa ----  is also a great prompt for those who are just getting used to AI and not quite sure of how to use it or what to say.I have Alexa Echo audio devices in every room along with the other leading AI assistant.  I find that I can avoid frustration when one of the AI assistants fails to understand me, or can not help me with that yet, to be able to ask the other and usually get a response.Now that displays are becoming the norm I decided to trade up.  I find it really helps to see a visualization of the response. I particularly like seeing lyrics to songs.  It is also nice to be able to set the home screen to present what one_ wants.  The sound on this 8 Echo Show is excellent.Echo Show 8 - HD 8"" smart display with Alexa is an ideal size for a kitchen counter or nightstand.  It_ a handy device that makes smart home control or information gathering even easier.",0
2,"Hate it
  
",19.Dec.19,Yes,"Got this thinking it would work with new Blink cameras, but what good is it when it won't show video or warning when cameras are motion-activated. Amazon says the Echo Show and the Blink software doesn't allow that. That renders it useless. And the Try ""Alexa"" suggestions that CONSTANTLY appear across the screen are driving me batty. There's no way to stop them, it just makes me want to take EVERY Alexa device in my house and throw them into the garbage bin. I should've listened to the other reviewers. That Try ""Alexa"" thing is like living in The Twilight Zone...it just won't stop, it keeps coming after you. I'll give Amazon one week to fix that...give me a way to turn it off, and if not...then I'll be sending this thing back.",0
3,"Don't expect to see your saved recipes on the allrecipes skill
  
",19.Dec.19,Yes,"I bought the Echo show primarily because I have used Allrecipes for years and have many saved recipes I use regularly.  Unfortunately, there is no way to bring up your saved favorites.  If you say the exact name of the recipe you want to make, it will give you something entirely different or will say it doesn't understand you.I decided to return it, but changed my mind:  Because we have thousands of photos on Amazon, they are showing on the Echo Show all the time; we love this feature.  We're seeing pictures we had totally forgotten about.  Every time we walk through the kitchen we both check to see what's showing now!I sure would love it if they'd fix Allrecipes so I could actually use it, though.",1

",19.Dec.19,Yes,"I have three Echo Show 3s for my home and purchased 3 others for Christmas presents.  ABSOLUTELY LOVE THESE.  Given my complete satisfaction with the 3s, I decided to go for the larger Echo Show 8 for my kitchen and bedroom.  I HATE THIS PRODUCT....H-A-T-E!!!  I cannot get the suggestions rotating at the bottom of the screen.  Why would anyone who owns this product need CONSTANT prompts rotating at the bottom of the screen -- SO DUMB!!!!",1
5,"Great size and great quality!
  
",19.Dec.19,Yes,"I like the Echo so much! Just ask for music and you_e got it!! It is big enough to use in the kitchen to follow recipes, watch movies and view pics. I like the ability to close the camera shutter and to turn off the mic when I want to. I play games with Alexa too.  You can also ask Alexa what was the last thing recorded and erase it!  I asked Santa for the smaller echo and a smart plug for Xmas!  So far I_ very pleased_",0
2,"A complete rebuke to consumers' wishes
  
",19.Dec.19,Yes,"I love my Show 5. I assumed that the new Show 8 would be an improvement. Instead it is a major step backwards. And the most disappointing part is that Amazon purposely did this and has thus far refused to rectify the very simple problems it installed in the Show 8. You can not use this product for the most basic function that I bought it for, a clock. It does not allow you to put a clock across the main screen. It does not give you the option to put the date anywhere on the face. And it will not allow you to erase the ""Alexa Try"" scroll at the bottom of the screen. Amazon's position is  that the ""Alexa Try"" features are not ads, but that is a moot argument because it is just as annoying as ads. I don't care if it is scrolling Shakespeare at the bottom of the screen, I should have the ability to disable it. Yet Amazon has so far not allowed it. And why, after all the multitude of buyers before me (unbeknownst to me before I bought the Show 8), would Amazon not make basic changes to a product that is so disliked by its customers? Amazon can make a simple software update to rectify all of the criticism, but they have refused to do so. The bottom line is that the Echo Show 8 has fewer basic features, is purposely annoying with its scroll, and costs more than the Echo Show 5. Quite honestly, the Echo Show 8 may be a harbinger for Amazon. Will the company react positively to the consumers' input, or will it continue along the Show 8 experiment and blatantly refuse to abandon common sense over its own agenda?",1
4,"So good, but deserves to be better!
  
",19.Dec.19,Yes,"I love this little thing. It has a good picture and really good sound. The UI is well thought out. The microphones pick up my voice, even when I whisper to test it's limits. I've connected and used my Spotify account for music. I've watched shows on it with Amazon Prime. Ahhhh, video. This thing is perfect to leverage video. I hope that Amazon is working with HBO Go, Hulu, and YouTube, of course. Content drives satisfaction of these devices and this screen based device deserves more video content.If give the hardware a 5, but the content gets a 3, selling in at a 4 overall.",0
4,"Very good but not perfect
  
",19.Dec.19,Yes,"Sound and video quality are excellent and it is the right size for sitting on the desk.  But some features are still missing.  No RDS is provided when listening to radio stations on the internet, thus no way to know what is playing.  Amazon should introduce direct DLNA support, as the few apps that offer support do not work well.  And why can't the Echo Show display maps when asked for directions?",0
3,"Beautiful video, sound is very good, but not that intuitive
  
",19.Dec.19,Yes,"The screen quality is excellent, the sound quality is very good, and the features are many.  In fact, that is a problem starting out.  There is no manual and online help is limited.  I suppose I could spring another $10 for a book, but why?  I'm already not happy that there is no pre-booking guarantee.  I pre-ordered for $99, and the day it arrived the price was $79, but I cannot get the lower price.There are many features but getting the most out of them is not always easy.  For example, the alarm has a repeat function for daily, weekly, weekends, or week days.  I work a rotating schedule so the days I need an alarm rotate every two weeks.  After a couple of weeks, I discovered if I touch the date once I set an alarm, I can get a calendar.  This way I can program just the days I want the alarm.  Too bad there isn't a manual to look this up.I'm sure the Echo Show will be more useful once I add more Alexa hardware and apps.  As it is, I'm turning on lights, setting the thermostat, utilizing time, temp, and alarm, listening to music, and watching video.  Other thing is, my wife hates to talk to Alexa.  Not sure what do about adding that app.",1
5,"Even better than the original Echo Show
  
",19.Dec.19,Yes,This one has a screen an inch bigger than the original Echo Show and less wasted space on the base. I have Alexa products in most rooms of my home. I am even gifting one to my family member this year since my family uses Alexa products in their home as well. I love how I can ask this to show my security camera and it notifies me when someone rings my Ring door bell. I can ask her to turn on my smart lightbulbs and even start my Ford car. She can even turn on my Vizio smart tv and retrieve Netflix on it. Inlove playing music on the everywhere group. Technology these days is great.,0

Happy with screen resolution, and the sound is way better than I expected. As to the prompts about skills - I kinda like them.

First, the sound seems not as clear as the Echo_t_ muddier. Second, there is no way to stop it from constantly showing suggestions of what to try saying to Alexa along the bottom of the screen. One annoyance is that the Alexa iPhone app for setting which photos to show is clunky and limiting.",1

",20.Dec.19,Yes,"I have a house full of Google Mini's and I was expecting a similar sound quality, but the sound on this device is rich and warm. I was pleasantly surprised. I would give this 5 stars if it had any sort of battery backup. A bought this to sit next to my bed and function as a both a sound machine (for sleeping at night) and alarm clock  I can't rely on it as an alarm clock if it goes out when the power does. For now I'll have to stick with my cell phone for waking.My 4 year old loves it and seems to find it much easier to use than the Mini.I love the music search, it searches Amazon music and when it doesn't find when I am looking for it automatically searches Spotify. I am find it to be far more accurate than the mini which seems to pick songs at random  I cannot tell if this is an issue with the Mini or Spotify.",0

1,"I bought the Echo Show 8 thinking it would be a larger Echo Show 5... nope.
  
",20.Dec.19,Yes,"If, like me, you thought the Echo Show 5 was fine (minus one glaring issue I'll get into later) but simply wanted a larger display to be able to see the time and temp across the room easier and thought that the Echo Show 8 would be exactly that... save your money.For some unknown reason the developers at Amazon decided that the clock &amp; temp display on the Echo Show 8 should only be able to take up a very small portion of the upper left-hand corner of the display.  This means that if you bought the Echo Show 8 to be able to see the clock easier due to it being larger you will actually get a smaller clock display.WuT?!Exactly.  Who at Amazon thought it would be a good idea to add code to limit the max size of the clock and temp on a device that costs more than the smaller version?  My eyes aren't even that bad but I can see how others with worse vision or possibly older people might prefer the larger display to be able to see the clock &amp; temp better.  Bamboozled!In addition, the constant need to ""advertise"" to paying customers that's present on the Echo Show 5 also carries over on the more expensive Echo Show 8, sadly.  No matter what you do you can't fully disable everything that rotates on the home screen.  This means that you can't disable all of that garbage and just have the home screen be a clock and the temperature 24/7/365.  Even if you disable every option as well as the ""Rotate Continuously"" at the bottom you will still have your precious clock &amp; temp minimize on a regular and constant basis while the stupid thing gives you ""pro tips"" of crap you can try saying.Amazon, how 'bout you give the users the option to FULLY and COMPLETELY disable this?!Enough people have complained about this and yet you persist on treating us like children.  Children with money to spend, mind you, but children nonetheless.  I don't need the hand holding that you seem to think we need.  I'm not huddled in a dark corner of my room shaking nervously frightened because I don't know how to ask Alexa to turn on a light.  You want to give new users a tutorial when they first set it up?  Fine.  This constant nagging that can't be disabled though is way, way, WAY too much.Enough people have hammered the reviews over exactly this on both devices and yet the solution has been ""coming soon"" for months.  This isn't a difficult change to implement if you really wanted to.I'm returning this Echo Show 8 due to these two reasons.  Awesome device (probably) if you can look past these issues I'm guessing.  I've already invested too much on three Echo Show 5's that I can't return so I'm not investing even more in an Echo Show 8 since it does the same BS only worse as those.If only Amazon was quicker to move on the simple requests of massive swaths of it's customers for one of their own products.  Maybe I'll go see what Google is offering in this same space now....",5

",20.Dec.19,Yes,"Like it.One of the main selling points for me is that it says you can play videos.You can play videos but only Amazon Prime Videos and Hulu as long as you subscribe and pay for them.If your thinking Netflix Video and YouTube Video forget it, won't work.Which is too bad because I already have subscriptions I pay for for these.",0

4,"Good with some struggles
  
",20.Dec.19,Yes,"overall a great addition. still working out the ability to broadcast thru other echo devices. VERY annoying ongoing issue with spotify (and other streaming services as I found out). stops playing songs after  a few songs, turns out this is caused by another not speaker device being included in the selection. My husband has big fingers and when adding the dots, accidently got a firestick on the everywhere group. once the firestick was removed, it works fairly well. I will stop after a time and you have to tell alexa to resume. Although I can't be sure, it seems to be at the end of the playlist. Took some searching on the forums to find out what might be causing the problems, definitely fixable though. Wish Amazon would get  rid of the constant message of ""try this"" TOTALLY NOT INTERESTED!",0

",20.Dec.19,Yes,"Overall, happy with my purchase. The bass is overkill when turned up at all. Wish there was access to Netflix or Disney+, but can get Hulu and Prime.

Nice little device, and a good edition to my growing smart home.",0
2,"So much where a tablet is leaps better
  
",20.Dec.19,Yes,"So far about the best use of the show is for things I can already do on the dot.  Adding a picture and a lot of nagging ""Did you know you can ...?"" does not make an improvement over a dot.  The only actual *use* for a screen is youtube, and that's gimped because of the apple/google fight.  I can't use the screen to queue amazon music, only press pause or play on what's already coming out.  I can't see a list of anything from TuneIn only say play or pause for what I queued by voice.  I can't see my DISH dvr recordings on the side, only say play or pause as if it was an echo.  I can't select or play from my Washington post subscription except via the website.  I can't, I can't, I can't.....I didn't expect the world, but if you're not into picture slideshows this is so far great potential, no results.  I'm just betting that like the early echo, it improves over time, at which point buying it for $80 during cyber Monday will turn out to be a good, not bad choice.",0
1,"Beware if you return
  
",20.Dec.19,Yes,"The product wouldn't connect to my wifi, so I live-chatted with Amazon to see what was up.  It took approximately 75 minutes for the agent to tell me to do everything I told him I had already done.  In the end, it was decided that the product was defective and I should exchange it for a new one.The new one came to the wrong address (home, where nobody is during the day, vs. work, which I'd requested), and was Refurbished, in a plain black box instead of the one the Echo Show should come in, with even the Refurbished sticker sliced open, and missing the power cord.When I called to complain and request a THIRD item, I was told that I'm only allowed to exchange an item once.  They would instead reimburse me for the second item, and I could go back in and order another item if I wanted to.This is a gigantic pain in the ass.",2
5,"Great for the kitchen and general use
  
",20.Dec.19,Yes,"There_ a lot of devices out there. Almost too many at times. But the good news is that usually means a lot of variety. The trick is selecting what works and applies to your needs without getting sucked into marketing and pointless features. With all that said, I_ say the echo 8 comes right where we wanted to land as a family.We originally purchased an echo 5 on Black Friday. While it_ great for the price, it_ small and the speakers are lacking when it comes to playing audio with any volume. The 8 definitely delivers over the 5 in terms of audio quality. Much clearer and robust.Larger screen is a big plus with better quality picture. This isn_ a device I_ expect or demand 4K in. 1080 is fine. Nothing is generally grainy or hard to see. It_ the right size for a kitchen without being excessive and space demanding.Performance wise it_ fast. Does a great job with home automation and commands. I like the shutter for the camera and button to cut the mic off.The only ding I_ give it is it should have the option of being a true smart hub. I would love to attach my z wave devices to it and remove the entirety of a secondary controller. I know the larger show does have some of these functions but at a much larger size it wasn_ what we wanted. Add in the extra cost, the show 8 was a winner for us.I_ recommend it to anyone who wants a good kitchen companion. The off white color is a nice compliment to kitchens. Reminds me of a typical appliance but attractive.",1
5,"Love it
  
",20.Dec.19,Yes,This is awesome.  I love that you can just ask Alexa to play music and it differs.  You can adjust volume by speech as well.  Ther music shows lyrics for certain songs which is cool.  Great sound and picture quality.  The volume at 5 is sufficient and loud enough for me but I did turn it up just to check the sound.  I was not disappointed. I also used to look up a recipe which was excellent.  I can't wait to see what else I can do with this.,0
5,"Needs Two way audio.
  
",20.Dec.19,Yes,Works great. Would like for it to work with my blink camera so I can talk back to the person at the door.  Amazon needs to work on that problem asap.,0
3,"ok
  
",21.Dec.19,Yes,Can't get rid of the ads.  Can't watch netflix.  Most of the time it doesn't understand what I am saying. Works fine for music. I unplug it when not in use.  That takes care of the recording and camera.....Downloaded my gmail but can't see it.,0
5,"Love it!
  
",21.Dec.19,Yes,"I had a Google Home, it was, at best, okay. But it can't compare to my new Echo Show 8.I found that when I ask it a question, it_ response on answers is far superior to what I was getting with my Google device. Plus it hears me better. The Google worked fine as long as I was sitting next to it but if I was on the other side of the room I had to shout at it for it to respond. That is not a problem with my Amazon device, I can use my normal speaking voice from anywhere in the room and it works perfectly.The sound is amazing. The speakers are probably 80% of the device so they are large they with a clear sound And offer a good amount of bass. It's really nice to just sit down and say _lexa play Frank Sinatra. And it sounds just wonderful.Plus it works with Amazon prime video, I can watch movies on it, and they sound great because of the wonderful speakers.No problem integrating it with my smart switches and outlets. I come home, I say hello to it it, turns on the correct lights. In the morning when I tell it good morning it gives me the weather, tells me what time it is, reads the news, and lets me know what is  on my calendar for the day. It_ fabulous!",0
5,"I absolutely LOVE it!
  
",21.Dec.19,Yes,"I love my Echo Show! I considered the 5"" Echo Show initially, but after viewing it on display in store, I felt that it was way too small for me.  I am glad I went with the 8"" display.",0
4,"Easy setup!!
  
",21.Dec.19,Yes,I was able to add this to my home with no issues. I did have a problem at first showing one of my Arlo camera's but suddenly it began to respond. It does show too many advertisements but that doesn't bother me like the others who have reviewed this item. I don't constantly look at the screen. Nice to be able to see my camera's around the house. The reason I gave it four stars is there is tremendous latency connecting to the cameras. Everything else on my network responds fine but this device. I'm hoping for a firmware fix. I'll update this review if I notice any changes in the future.,0

Still haven't figured out if we can do a group chat / call, but so far so good.I would recommend getting the stand. The angle the camera is at pretty much looks at the ceiling.The sound and video quality is good. And it does flash news and ideas on the screen.

",21.Dec.19,Yes,Still finding new things but love it. The sound is 2 thumbs up,0
3,"limited documentation and inconsistent voice activation lead to frustration with this product
  
",21.Dec.19,Yes,The Alexa voice activation was inconsistent and required the end user to set up and document what verbal constructs actually work to achieve the goal. The program should act to recognize when the user is trying to  achieve some outcome and when it is finally reached identify the verbal sequence and relate it to the many attempts used before success and recognize these when they occur again. Now  a long process of learning what phrases in what gramatical order and  using which descriptors is required in all but the simplest of requests. Documentation is limited and aside from purchasing books written by authors who have puzzeled out the supposed manual of operation there is sparse and incomplete online content provided. All in all very frustrating and very limiting in usages of this product and ecosystem provided by online interfaces....,1
2,"Lacking basic screen customization
  
",21.Dec.19,Yes,"The Show 8 lacks customization options that the Show 5 apparently has.  You can change the background and what data scrolls through, but the size of the time, the temp and showing today's date at all are not options.  You also constantly get Alexa suggestions.  Many tips on customization seem to be for other devices as there is no ""Home and Clock"" setting on the Show 8.  The only clock setting is 24 HR.  My mistake for thinking the 8 and the 5 had similar features, but the Show 8 options seem very lacking for any device with a screen.  But then the misleading tips on using the Show 8 didn't help that misunderstanding.The frustrating thing is that the Show 8 is almost a very good product. It just lacks basic customization which takes away from its other features.  If it had the UI of the Show 5, likely this would be a 5 star review.  As it is, the Show 8 screen just doesn't give much value add.",0
4,"When it works it fun.
  
",21.Dec.19,Yes,The sound is a little hollow. Alexa doesn_ always know what we are asking for. I like the bigger screen. I listened to music most of the time. Talk radio and podcasts. For these items it works fine. But sometimes the directions have to be done 3 times to finally get it to work,1

5,"Exceeding expectations so far!
  
",21.Dec.19,Yes,"We have barely scratched the surface of our Echo_ capabilities, but are very pleased after a week of use. Amazon Music Unlimited is incredible! We have indulged in Christmas music, Gregorian chants, death metal, oldies and more. The recipes function is very cool. Set up of the device was intuitive and easy, and we downloaded the Alexa app as well. The Echo is sleek and attractive on our roll top desk. Sound quality is surprisingly good for a relatively small device.",0
5,"Wish I bought two on Black Friday
  
",21.Dec.19,Yes,"Works well with wyze cameras, ring doorbell, august door lock, and all other normal Alexa enabled devices. Love ""seeing"" stuff, like daily news, recipes, song lyrics . . . so fun for aging mother (bought for her), easy to use, and keeps her company when we're at work.",0
2,"Not ready for prime time -doesn't integrate well with Blink XT2
  
",22.Dec.19,Yes,"After wasting much time and effort I discovered that the Blink XT2 and Blink Skill does not work reliably with Show 8 in either Best or Enhance resolution. A real bummer as the Saver resolution is not satisfactory for me. Integration with the Blink cameras is the main reason for purchasing the Show 8.When I ask Alexa to show me the camera I usually get the OK response, a short delay then camera sound but no video. Sometimes Alexa says OK then shortly announces ""Something must have gone wrong"".Blink reportedly has actually been aware of the problem for months and is promising a fix in the future but is not saying when. If it is taking so long to fix it must be a major flaw or it is a ""back burner"" project for them. I have not seen anything in either the Blink or Show documentation/advertising that lets customers know NOT to expect integration in anything but the ""Saver"" mode.Needless to say I am not a pleased customer. I would give the Show 8 only one star based on the problem with Blink but other features work well for the most part so far.",0

5,"Awesome! Like it.
  
",22.Dec.19,Yes,Great Product and recommend!,0
4,"Pretty good... but hopefully it will improve with time
  
",22.Dec.19,Yes,"I bought the Echo Show 8 as a Christmas gift for my wife, who wanted to use it in the kitchen. She was a bit heartbroken over the the ""things to try"" scrolling non-stop across the screen, we were going to return the unit. However, Amazon must have gotten many complaints because they got rid of it. Once that was fixed we set about figuring out how to use it. More on that in the Good/Could be better below.Mounting:Our kitchen is tiny, so the only option was to mount it below a cabinet. Note that there is no provision to mount it this way. I had to make a mount that curled down and around the back to the bottom. There is a metal plate on the bottom of the Echo Show 8 and it can be secured with a large magnet.. which is what I did. Because we are tight on counter space, I made the mount on a rail that allows the whole unit to be slid back under the cabinet to get it out of the way (you can see this in the pictures I included.)  If we had a bit more room we would have just set it on the counter or picked up one of the many mounts available.The good:The screen is bright, clear and adapts nicely to changes in ambient light. The clock is useful. You can load your own pics so it rotates through them, making a nice picture frame (my wife loves this.) When you ask for the weather it gives a nice display of the hourly temps/forecast, or a weeks overview, depending on what you ask for (see pic.) The speaker is adequate. Alexa does all the things available on Dot or other device: runs routines, turns lights on and off, has the Guard feature, etc.  The Echo Show 8 is useful for viewing security cameras, we have some Wyze cameras and we can just ask ""Alexa, show me the entrance"" and in a few seconds, its on the screen (see pic.) When you play music, the Echo 8 displays the lyrics. If you set a countdown timer while cooking, it remains on the screen. If you set two timers, it shows the one that is going to go off first, then shows the second: my wife loves this for cooking (she used to have to keep asking Alexa ""how much time is left on the timer?"" as she tried to coordinate multiple items being readied. You can watch movies on the Echo Show 8 as well, probably not the best screen for viewing, but it does work.To be frank, the Echo 8 earns its keep just on the above features.The ""could be better"":When looking up recipes, the Echo 8 displays them one at a time. It is exactly like an Echo Dot, except there is a picture - the screen could be utilized to show multiple possibilities and cut the browsing time down tenfold. There is no provision to enter and save your own recipes, my wife still gets out her Ipad and uses that.  Amazon says there are thousands of skills, but the majority of them are at best, kinda lame (having the Gordon Ramsey skill make rude comments about food was funny for about 15 seconds.) Like the recipe function, very few of the skills are optimized to work with a screen in a helpful way... this is an area that really disappointed us. I was expecting something that could work more like a tablet in capabilities.We have multiple Alexa Dots throughout the house, and their capabilities have grown tremendously over the past two years. Many of the capabilities were unexpected and very useful, such as Guard and geofencing, both of which we now use daily.  I suspect, and hope, that the Echo Show 8 evolves in the same way.",0
2,"disappointed with the quality
  
",22.Dec.19,Yes,"I like Alexa and have a few echo dots. I decided to try the show since it was on sale. Everything about Alexa integration works fine. Speaker is ok.

",23.Dec.19,Yes,"Here's why I'm giving it 1 star. The Echo 5 has a clock face you can change, make analog or digital, have different colors, etc; it's the cool feature you see on all the commercials. The Echo 8 (this device) does not have that functionality, it only has a small 1/2"" clock that appears on the top left of the screen. This device also has this ""Try this on Alexa"" recommendation on the bottom of the screen that changes every 10 seconds or so; you cannot get rid of this, there is NOT currently a setting to remove it. Also the skill to control Amazon music is seriously lacking, all you can do is pause music or forward/reverse to the next song.

2,"Buy the Echo Show 5 Instead
  
",23.Dec.19,Yes,"IMHO, the Echo Show 5 (FIVE) is the best all-around Echo device you can buy. It is my bedside alarm clock, and so much more. Amazon hit it out of the park with the FIVE, and I couldn't be happier.But this review isn't about the FIVE. It's about the Echo Show 8 (EIGHT), and in this case, Amazon clearly struck out.The EIGHT should have been a larger version of the FIVE. Doing so would have made up for the one area where the FIVE is somewhat lacking--sound quality. But no, Amazon decided to go off in a different direction with the EIGHT, and in doing so, made a mess of what could have been an amazing device.Is the EIGHT a good clock? No. Most of the time, the clock is shoved into the upper left-hand corner of the screen, using about 10% of the available screen space. You absolutely cannot read the time unless you are less than two feet away from the device. When the device is in night mode, the clock is shoved into the lower left-hand corner of the screen, and is about twice as large, which means you can be about four feet from the device to read the time. As a clock, the EIGHT is a complete failure.Does the EIGHT play videos? Yes; however, I have a TV, a laptop, and an iPad. If I want to watch a video, I'm going to use one of those devices.Does the EIGHT play music? Yes, and the sound is almost as good the original Echo (almost), which I still have and still use. It displays track information while playing. In some cases, it also displays lyrics. If that's important to you, it's a plus. You can also connect this to external speakers through a patch cord or Bluetooth, but if you do that, the value of the EIGHT is diminished.Is the EIGHT a digital frame? Well, it could be. It tries to be. The picture is beautiful, to be sure. It's nice to see rolling images, either stock or your own, in beautiful high-resolution color. Unfortunately, the view is interrupted by the clock in the upper right-hand corner (not a big deal) and the ever-present ""try this"" at the bottom. BTW, are digital frames even a thing anymore?I read the reviews before purchasing this, so I knew what I was getting into. But it was stupid cheap, and I couldn't pass it up at the holiday deal price, so what the heck.All things considered, the EIGHT could be great...it just isn't. Amazon blew it. It is my least favorite device and, quite frankly, not worth the price, even on sale.I'm not going to return it for two reasons. First, I knew what I was getting when I bought it, so I can't say I'm disappointed. My expectations were already low. Second, Amazon has a way if improving their devices, and the EIGHT is still relatively new in the line-up. I have expectations that Amazon will hear consumer feedback and make changes to the EIGHT that make it more like the FIVE, which is what it should have been in the first place.If you haven't purchased an EIGHT yet, don't. Get the FIVE instead. You will be far happier, especially if you want the device as a clock.",1

",23.Dec.19,Yes,It's nice to have a screen to look at when u ask for weather and news but it doesn't work with alexa app so it's a lot harder to set up even tho u have a screen to look at during set up. And surprisingly the screen doesn't have many options to use with it mostly cameras everything u can do with an echo and TV. I'd of thought the screen would of had more options. It's nice but not what I expected. Guess it's cheaper than portal lol if u want to video chat with fam but it'd harder to use than an echo and does half the things echo does. Id say good for kitchen stuff over bedroom. It's nice to wake up to a clock and weather but I'm sure cheaper options for just that. In kitchen u can look up recipes and make shopping list or order products.,0

3,"Keep it or dump it?
  
",23.Dec.19,Yes,"The original unit had to be replaced before the end of the first week.  The  echo 8 kept cutting out especially when listening to news and music.  Instead of amazon replacing it with a new Echo Show 8,  I was sent a unit identified as refurbished.  How they could have refurbished units within days of the release of a new product is unclear.The replacement had a different problem.  After being on for 15 or 20 minutes, the Echo 8 refused to respond to an Alexa command. It simply stayed on with what was playing even when screaming Alexa right over it.  The Amazon technician I called couldn_ believe it either. We spent nearly an hour going back to the beginning with restoring to factory settings.  We agreed to keep it playing and have her call me after 30 minutes to see if the Alexa command could get it to stop playing.  She did call back as promised and, guess what, the fix took.  Alexa did her job.  I praised the technician for her expertise and effort and thought a new day had begun.Except it hadn_.  The next day it was as if nothing had been done.  The Echo 8 refused to respond to the off or stop command, making it necessary to disconnect the power.A day later I am still wondering what to.  Should I call tech support and go through another remedial effort which will probably fail or should I ask for a third unit, one which is new and not refurbished?  Or how about a third option: request a refund and send it back?  I would easily opt for choice 3 if the picture and sound weren_ so great.  They are outstanding.  To be or not to be.",0

",23.Dec.19,Yes,"The picture and sound quality are excellent...I placed mine in the kitchen. It does everything you've come to expect from an echo device, but the video takes it up a notch. It's almost like having a easy to use tablet always available on your countertop.  I've only had it a couple of days, but these are a few of the things I've discovered it can do. When you play music, it sounds great and it usually brings up a screen with lyrics. It shows several temperature displays when asking about weather. It will link to your Ring doorbell and display the video from it. It opens easy to read recipes with a simple request. It plays music videos. You can pick what types of data or pictures you would like displayed on your home page. It also displays your Google calendar and reminds you of tasks. It can control all your smart devices with voice or touch screen. I'm sure there's much more, but I really like the look and quality of this. I'm definitely going to be picking up more for other rooms in the house.",0
3,"Open box sold as new! _
  
",23.Dec.19,Yes,"The product is as expected it, but there is something amiss with the package: the seal is broken. I assume it's a returned product. Even though it's just an open box, it cannot be sold as new.  I would like to return it. I waited 20 days to have it. Let's be serious!",0
4,"Great Display Size for Older Person
  
",23.Dec.19,Yes,"The size and image quality of the 8"" device suits my older eyes much better than the Echo spot it replaced on my desk. This alone justifies the investment for me.  I dislike the non-intuitive way to stop a video (Alexa, home screen).  The sound quality is better than that of smaller Echo devices I own, but still not good enough to listen to music getting fatigued after a while.",0
4,"Great dev8ce
  
",23.Dec.19,Yes,"This Echo is almost perfect. The one issue I have with it is that it sometimes has selective hearing. I try to ""wake it up"" and it may or may not respond. I am not used to yelling to wake up my Alexa devices.I love the camera, especially the photobooth function. The pictures can be a little grainy. Filters would make it a little more fun.",0
2,"Not Enabled for Show and Tell Feature
  
",23.Dec.19,Yes,"This is the second Echo Show device that we purchased. First the Echo 5 and now the Echo 8. In each case I was told that the ""show and tell"" feature for the blind was enabled. (""Alexa,What am I holding"") Not So. Be careful to verify the generation for the product that has this feature and unfortunately the Service team at Amazon is not familiar with the feature and prone to faulty and incorrect advice.",1
4,"Pretty Cool
  
",23.Dec.19,Yes,"When I first got it, I asked who the 26th president was? Alexa responded ""Teddy Weirdo"" laughed about it told some friends who got the same answer, now it's corrected to Teddy Roosevelt, so they do pay attention apparently... Still trying to find some ""Light Almond"" colored smart switches to work with it. bought one for my mother in law,so we can ""drop in on her, haven't set it up yet, as it's a Chriatmas present...",0

4,"It's good, but not perfect
  
",24.Dec.19,Yes,"For the price, it's a good value. The sound is considerably better than the new Echo Dots, but still a little short from the level of the regular Echos. The screen quality is fine for what it is and the setup was dead simple. However, for me this device failed to do one thing I really, really wanted it to do... play lyrics. Sure, an Echo Show 8 will totally play lyrics... just not if you're playing to a group with Sonos speakers in it. I incorrectly assumed I would be able to have an Echo and Sonos speakers play together so I could get the lyrics on the screen... nope. If you're a pure Echo home, this is a non-issue. The new Echo Studio sounds amazing, but that didn't exist years ago and I'm pretty heavily invested in the Sonos world now. Oh well... it's still a good device and I won't be returning it.",0
5,"Echo Show 8
  
",24.Dec.19,Yes,"I already had a Show 5 when I ordered the 8 and had found the 5 to be a great product.  When I received the 8, I found the performance to be on par with the Echo 5.  The sound is great and it is nice to have the topics pictured like for example the weather forecast, versus just having an oral description.  In addition, I have a Ring Pro doorbell and find the Echo's to be very helpful in seeing the door camera and in responding to UPS, USPS, and FedEx deliverymen.  I highly recommend the product.",0
3,"routine not working
  
",24.Dec.19,Yes,"i have an abode alarm and it worked perfectly with my echo spot. when i saw echo show 8, i like the bigger screen compared to my echo spot. however, i realized that the routines i have set up with my abode and echo spot does not work anymore with my echo show 8. i plugged back my echo spot to verify my routines and still worked with my echo spot but not with my echo show 8. i chose my routines to broadcast in echo show 8 but still did not worked. i hope amazon will do an update to correct this.",0
5,"Nice tool
  
",24.Dec.19,Yes,"I like the Echo Show. I find it does a lot more than I expected, in some cases. In others, it seems limited. I can ask it to do things that I had recently asked for without problem, but then it will not show me. It just stays on the home page. It can be confusing and I_ not sure if it_ me or the echo. Otherwise, the sound is excellent. The picture is beautiful. I enjoy using it for fun and when I need assistance.",0

",24.Dec.19,Yes,"The display is nice, but doesn't add much functionality that I use. I thought I would use it with my Ring Doorbells, but it is too much bother and I just get up and answer the door. We live in the sticks and there aren't any security concerns here.This Echo will respond to requests even if you are 15 feet away and standing right next to another Echo. Also, my receiver will not automatically reconnect to the Echo using Bluetooth. I have to forget the connection on the Echo and re-associate it every time. It is a Denon receiver. I would occasionally have that problem with the Echo Plus, (once a month?) but most of the time it reconnected fine.  I have an Echo Show 5 that does not have that problem at all with an AudioEngine speaker set in my office, so the problem may be with my receiver.",0

1,"To the Echo Show product developers
  
",24.Dec.19,Yes,"To the Echo Show Developers...having been a very loyal Amazon user for over 10 years and I have to say that I am extremely disappointed and frustrated with the Echo Show product and the Amazon support of this product.On the surface the potential for the product is tremendous...however, for whatever reason, Amazon has chosen NOT to provide any documentation on the products capabilities nor any instructions on how to correctly use and take advantabe of all of the product capabilities.  In the first two days with the product, I have had to call Amazon Support 4 times to get instructions on how Echo Show works with Amazon Photo. to do basic things like upload a photos, creating photo albums and adding additional photos to these photo albums...and these are all fundamentally basic capabilities.  In total, I have spent more than 3 hours on these 4 support calls because after about 30-45 mins of fumbling around, the Amazon support person has told me that they are really not that familiar with the Show product or with Amazon Photo product and they transfer me to someone else...who has more knowledge of the products.  These new support persons have access to ""step by step"" instructions (or can direct me to the Help section) with these ""step by step"" instructions to do specific tasks.  But even then, they cannot find or direct me to any ""step by step"" help to work with things like Photo Albums...If this Echo Show product is going to really be successful, Amazon needs to provide users like me with documentation on all of the products features and ""step by step"" instructions on how to take advantage and use these features.  For a product with such great potential, I am about to throw it out because it has been so difficult and frustrating to use.Jim Paynter314-308-5858jimpaynte9@gmail.com",0

3,"One major flaw, otherwise good
  
",25.Dec.19,Yes,"(As of 12-25-2019)  I just received and installed the Echo Show 8 several days ago. It soon upgraded itself to the latest software. I had read many Show reviews, including complaints about the constant ""Things to Try"" notices on the screen. Also read a couple reviews that claimed to instruct how to turn this ""feature"" off.So, after getting the Show 8 going, there were the never-ending things to try on the screen. So I tried the steps others had earlier listed. NONE work now at this time.  Over several hours I tried everything, no joy.So I got Amazon Help online and started the Chat (with ""Tech""). After 10-15 minutes of delay and ""Thanks for waiting"" and ""Let me check on that"", etc., the expert said the actual tech folks said that at present there is NO WAY to turn that off. But they would surely take my ""suggestion"" into account for future upgrades. UNBELIEVABLE!If this will not irritate you, the Show 8 is otherwise a very powerful tech addition to your Echo house (I have 9 other Echo devices at home).IF they do allow the ""Things to Try"" feature to be removed in the future I will update this...1/1/20 Indeed if you turn on ""Do Not Disturb"" it will no longer display the maddening ""Things to Try"", although if the device is doing something for you TTT will activate during that time. Device is slow to shift gears but after a few seconds it will return to the screen with only the clock and a moon icon. If you have personal pictures as a background, they WILL continue under DND.  Now a great device, lol...",0
5,"Great sound, gets better the more you play with it!
  
",25.Dec.19,Yes,"Bought this instead of replacing my defunct electronic picture frame. Now I stream pictures from amazon photos and they look great on this screen. It's in the kitchen so great for using for the radio or internet but I'm finding the more I play with this, the more useful it is. I have Sonos speakers all over the house and can control them with a skill, which is great. But, the sound on this little baby i nearly there with the sound from the Sonos one, which i pretty impressive, loud and no distortion.Alexa has some pretty impressive capabilities and one of them is keeping my kids entertained. We already had an echo dot before this but now we are starting to communicate around the house with Alexa.Easy to install, easy to set up, easy to use. You get regular emails that inform you of new (and existing) ways to talk to her and get her to do things.Absolutely fantastic value as far as I'm concerned :-)",2
5,"Great for the kitchen
  
",25.Dec.19,Yes,Dislike is I can't seem to get it to do one specific pic for the clock like I can on the 5.  I've been able to do it on 2 5's so maybe I just can't seem to find it on this one and can only find themes.Like is web browser to do pinterest for my recipes.Loves are the timer (it's on the display somewhere so it can be seen without asking how much time is left and there is a swipe up to dismiss...I've noticed it can't always hear you if music is playing or alarm going off).  Watching some TV with the boys while I cook dinner.  Displays weather from time to time and also my calendar.  Some of the things that pop up I could live without but it's not a big deal...glance and move on.,0

",25.Dec.19,Yes,For Entertainment and Research.,0
5,"Something For Everyone.  Great Purchase!
  
",25.Dec.19,Yes,"For those that don_ like _ry Alexa on the bottom,  you can go to the Alexa app,  choose your _how in the device setting,  scroll down and turn on do not disturb.  Also, you can simply ask Alexa to turn on do not disturb. It changes the screen to a largerclock and removes the _ry Alexa. I can still see my photos changing like a digital picture frame. I would imagine the next software update may give more options to toggle it off,  have more clock options, etc.As for the normal experience of having the Echo Show 8,  what a fun and useful tool that will take a long time to explore all of its uses. Sound and picture are very good.  I have some Foscam cameras,  Arlo and Nest cameras that are enabled and working.  This is not a security monitor, but gives you a convenient way to see what is going on.  I have an LG TV I can turn on and off, change volume and channels, some smart plugs to turn lights off an on.  Look,  for the $79 I paid for this it does more than anything else I own!  I also have been watching Amazon Prime movies on it and that has been fun.I think your chances of being very happy with this are very high.  I was so pleased that I bought 3 more ( with free Echo Dots ($75 at Best Buy) for my grown children!",2
1,"Good if you_e only looking to get an hour out of it
  
",25.Dec.19,Yes,"Got the Echo Show 8 as a Christmas gift. Plugged it in and set it up around 1 pm. A little after 2 I saw it restarting out of the corner of my eye and assumed it was a software update or something. Except it kept rebooting, never getting past the amazon logo. After searching online and trying everything I could find, then chatting with Amazon for over 45 minutes, apparently I have a defective unit and can_ get it replaced for 2 weeks. This was a gift I wasn_ originally thrilled with as I didn_ see enough value in it compared to my echo dot, and now I_ down right annoyed and wish I wasn_ given it (not being ungrateful, just becoming more of a hassle than it_ worth)",0
5,"The Echo Show is more fun than the Echo Dot
  
",25.Dec.19,Yes,Having a display to look at is very appealing. Topics are shown which you might want to learn about and you can then ask Alexa. It is good as an appointment reminder and a clock. We're hooking ours up with a Ring doorbell and will be able to tell who's ringing our doorbell.,0
5,"Continued Improvements
  
",25.Dec.19,Yes,"I have owned all iterations of the echo.  Amazon continues to improve the units. Near field works better, sound quality and video have also been improved.  Wife has the 5, but I liked a bigger screen and this fits the bill. I actually replaced a google nest with this and never looked back.  Google is still the king on ""googling"" random stuff but Amazon continues to improve. Integration with their ecosystem is seemless.",0
5,"Nice addition to the kitchen!
  
",25.Dec.19,Yes,"I haven_ had the Echo Show 8 very long but in the short time I_e had it I love it. It looks great in the kitchen especially with the slideshow of photos that I have on Amazon photos. I turned off most of the features that it came with such as frequently updating the news as the display was too busy for my taste. So far I have used it mostly to listen to music, which sounds very good, but soon I intend to do a few recipe trials.  For me the 8 screen is perfect in its location.",0

2,"It works great, BUT......
  
",25.Dec.19,Yes,"The Echo Show 8 works just as described. The voice recognition is great, The screen is crisp and it works just fine, BUT. And that is a BIG BUT!!! It is a BIG data drain. Installing it has doubled my monthly usage. I have a 250 GB plan and I am struggling today to not go over my limit.  Normal usage without the Echo Show 8 was about 100 GB per month and has been that way for more than a year. But since I installed the Show 8, about 1 month ago, I am at 222 GB at this moment and I have 6 days left in my usage month. I received the ECHO Show 8 on Dec 7th, and installed it soon after that. I shut it down three days ago to conserve data.  So if you are on a data plan with a limit,, BUYER BEWARE!!!",1
5,"Works as Advertised
  
",25.Dec.19,Yes,The image is very clear and integrates easily into the Alexa household.  I find the sound a bit bass-y and have adjusted the built-in equalizer to bring out more treble.

4,"It's worth the buy
  
",25.Dec.19,Yes,The price was right at $38.34.What a steal for a nice product. Sound is good and clear video,0
3,"Almost there
  
",25.Dec.19,Yes,"The sound is amazing, picked this one over the regular 10in just because of that. Being a screen, it needs more premium video capabilities, as of now just a fancy echo dot. But once it has YouTube, Netflix and all other popular video apps, it will be a 5 star without a question.",0
5,"Nice Add To Echo Family
  
",25.Dec.19,Yes,This is a perfect add to the Echo Family.  As an early adopter of Alexa I have just about every device.  I used the Amazon Trade In offer on this and traded my Spot.  I like the larger screen like on my Echo Show gen 1.  This was very easy to set up and paired easily with my Echo Clock.  I use it in my kitchen and the size is perfect.  I have had none of the issues that some have described in their reviews.  It works all of my smart home devices with no issue as well.  A nice little device.,0

I just received this and have to get used to it. Already I have learned that I need to find a way to get some kind of speakers. If you are listening to music with deep bass it has to be lower. I don_ think it can do well With the speakers it has. But for the size And price it is good. The product is great. I will learn more as I go. I look forward to doing that. The 8th show is groovy. I like it!",0

5,"Have had it a while now
  
",26.Dec.19,Yes,"And I'm really pleased with this. I had debated between this size and the larger one, but ultimately decided this would fit well in the space I had. I have this in my kitchen, I use it for viewing my recipes, playing music, etc. This is not my only alexa device in the house, I have a dot (in my daughters room and on her account), an echo show 5 (in my office), and the Fire cube.We had to turn off the voice activation on the cube (we have an open concept, so they were fighting) which my husband hates anyway, so he didn't mind that. My daughter had briefly moved her dot in her room and we discovered me using the show in the kitchen (near her room) was setting off her dot too, so she moved hers back and away from her door.I've been playing music (spotify) in my office and walked into the kitchen to see if it would play on both devices, or what would happen. It picked up where the office one left off, the office one stopped, but when I went back into the office (much later), what was playing in the kitchen did not start in the office. It's not a big enough deal to me to go see how to fix it, but in case anyone was wanting that functionality, you may want to look that up.I'm pleased with the size, I was hoping I wouldn't regret not getting the larger one, but I don't. It fits perfectly, I can see the screen just fine, and I've had no issues. My husband was worried I'd get the bigger one for my office, but I prefer the smaller one there too.",1

I am able to customize the background, colors and fonts of the clock.  On the Echo Show 8 I am not able to customize anything.  The clock is stuck in the corner and is very small.  Another annoying feature on the Show 8 is the Alexa suggestions at the bottom of the screen.  I don't need those suggestions rotating all the time.

I love that I can ask questions without touching a single button and see it on the screen almost instantaneously.  Sometimes when I ask to hear a song, it shows the lyrics (sometimes).  I downloaded the Samuel L. Jackson celebrity voice skill to it, and that made it more entertaining.  It looks beautiful on my desk and dims at night, respectfully.",1
5,"I love it!
  
",26.Dec.19,Yes,"I'm loving my new Alexa Show 8.  I've had 3 Alexa products (Echo, Dot and Spot) and this is by far the best.  The sound quality is incredible for such a small device.  The screen clarity is very good and the size is just right to view videos without being too small.  All I had to do was plug the device in and it was ready to go. My husband was also a fan and he doesn't really pay much attention to any of my new devices. He loves how he is able to see the lyrics to his favorite songs on the screen. I don't mind seeing the messages of ""things to try"" and it wasn't a deal breaker for me.  I actually ""tried"" a few suggestions. I'm thinking of gifting one to my son so I can chat with my granddaughter and get the extra benefit of having a large screen.",0

Maybe an update will fix this dumbest of smart devices in the future.",0
3,"Easy setup but does not do What I was hoping it would do.
  
",26.Dec.19,Yes,"It does everything the Echo Dot does but I was hoping it would access more apps from my fire stick. It would be nice if it could access my recast TV and then we could watch pre-recorded shows and television in our kitchen where it_ located. They made it sound like it could access all the apps and everything I read.As it turns out it was only access prime Hulu and photos plus for some reason NBC. Hopefully in the future they will be doing upgrades to this. I got it on Black Friday pricing so I didn_ waste a lot of money and it is good for what it does do, but I was hoping for more",0

",26.Dec.19,Yes,It works well with my Ring so I can visually see whose at my door.,0
2,"Works well, but a security hzard and annoying
  
",26.Dec.19,Yes,"It's goofy you have to install an app on your phone to set-up and control an Echo, since it's already an Internet connected device. If you have personal security concerns, this device is NOT for you. While you CAN add contacts without allowing the Alexa app on your phone to have access to your phone's contact list, you are still adding an app without knowing exactly what info it is gathering and forwarding. My Echo was a gift to me, but honestly, the video phone feature, which is nice, could just as easily be satisfied by Skype, on a more portable platform like a laptop. If you want this device, and personal security, buy it, install the Alexa app on your phone, enter your contacts, then uninstall the app. You CANNOT add a contact directly via the Echo device, since contacts apparently are not stored locally - so be aware you are giving that info to Amazon to ""manage' for you. Also understand you are giving Amazon permissin to retain everything you do via the Echo, including recording your audio.After mucking with settings I was able to eliminate (turn off) the constant (and very annoying) scrolling through displays of trending topics, weather reports etc. I'd find that distracting and annoying if it was constantly in my field of vision. What you CAN'T turn-off is the never-ending scrolling of prompts at the bottom of the screen demanding you ""Try 'Alexa, do something or other'. Either cover it with a piece of tape, or turn the device so it's face-down.All that said, it works fine, if you don't mind having your calls recorded, your phone compromised, and essentially allowing a sophisticated eaves-dropping device in your home. Remember, the ""S"" in ""IOT"" stands for security.",0

Picture quality is excellent, I have watched a few movies, recipes, and even my ring doorbell.  Overall This is just the right size for the kitchen of bedroom.",0
5,"Echo Show 8
  
",26.Dec.19,Yes,"Okay, so it still gives completely incorrect responses to my questions sometimes, but over all has a 95% accuracy.  Sound quality can be a bit bass heavy, but overall okay. I do love how it integrates with my Ring doorbell and my smart thermostat.",0
3,"Full clock not available
  
",26.Dec.19,Yes,"One of the things I love about the Echo Show 5 is the ability to display a full clock.  This is not an option with Show 8.  In order to continually display the clock, you need to set up the Do Not Disturb, which will show the clock and turn off the Things to Try.  When playing prime video's, the picture is clear and the sound is good.  Overall, if I had purchased the Echo 8 first instead of the Echo 5, the shortcomings wouldn't have been as obvious.  In all honesty, I prefer the Echo 5, even though it doesn't show video, which is something I usually do on an IPad or TV.",0
5,"Very handy
  
",26.Dec.19,Yes,"So far a great addition to our house. Very handy in the kitchen for music, recipes, general questions and shopping lists.",0

4,"The best Echo yet
  
",26.Dec.19,Yes,"The best screen yet, I just wish it were larger.I highly recommend the optional base. It not only adds some needed height but allows you to tip the screen down just a bit which I feel was required.The extra height of the optional base is especially needed for crowded counters because anything you put down in front of the device blocks the screen.",0
5,"Love it!!
  
",26.Dec.19,Yes,The echo show 8 is a great item! Does everything I want with great sound and video. SO glad Santa brought it early!!,0
3,"Can't turn off ""Try This"" and annoying pop up cards
  
",26.Dec.19,Yes,"The most annoying ""feature"" is the constant bombardment of ""Try this"" tips and pop up cards.  I've tried to dismiss these from the setting menu to no avail.  It does make a good hub for managing smart home device, but at the cost of being pinged by cards with irrelevant information.",0
4,"Close to expectations
  
",26.Dec.19,Yes,"The SHOW 8 works well, but I agree with a lot of the reviews, I hate the ""Try Alexa"" at the bottom of the screen and then more words regarding the ""try"" on the middle of the screen. We need a fix to this. Also a little miffed that when I paired to a bluetooth speaker the SHOW speakers quit while bluetooth speaker plays. Would have been great to have both at the same time. Overall pleased.",0
5,"We like it
  
",26.Dec.19,Yes,The sound is great,0
1,"""Try 'Alexa...'"" No thank you.
  
",26.Dec.19,Yes,"This would be a great device if it didn't have the annoying Try Alexa hints on screen with no ability to turn it off. I've had Alexa devices for several years now, and I don't need additional suggestions on how to integrate Alexa more into my daily life. I'm contemplating returning the device, I find it so annoying. To me it borders on advertising, and I don't want a device that shows advertising with no way to opt out.On the upside, I did figure out how to integrate with my Ubiquiti cameras so that's been nice.",0
5,"Our Favorite Echo Yet
  
",26.Dec.19,Yes,"We bought this to replace the Echo Show 5 in our kitchen, because while there was nothing particularly wrong with it, the 5's screen was insufficient to work well with recipes. We LOVE the Echo Show 8. It's size is perfect for a kitchen ecosystem, and it fits perfectly into the home as the hub of our smart home (smart switches, smart plugs. smart thermostat) nothing all that crazy.Really, you buy these devices for sound (the Echo Show 8 is excellent in this domain (good rich vibrance and resonance) as well as the screen ( the Echo Show 8 runs circles around the Show 5 in this domain). I've never had the 10 Echo Show, but honestly, I feel the Show 8 fits just into the ""just right"" category.Simply put, if you already love the Echo ecosystem, add this. The Show 5 is a great alarm clock, but if your going to interact alot (we average probably 20-25 Show 8 interactions), get the Show 8, you really won't regret it. Like others, do I wish it had a way to take off the things to try...of course.  That said, am I going to be petty and mark down the entire things for that design flaw? No, I won't. It does what it does beautifully, that works for me and my family.",1
1,"""Try Alexa""?  Really?
  
",26.Dec.19,Yes,"We had seven Echos in our house, and then we received a new Echo Show 8 for Christmas.Pro:  Pretty good sound.  ""Show me the front door"" works with our Ring camera.Con: There's no way to disable the frigging ""Try Alexa"" rolling advertisement on the home screen.  It sucks.  It REALLY sucks.  And Amazon doesn't have an option to pay more to remove the advertisement.  Imagine if your toaster was continuously (24 hours a day, 7 days a week) trying to persuade you to make new and different kinds of toast.  And you had PAID your own MONEY for that toaster.My next home automation speaker is going to be from Google.  I'm tired of the continuous up-sell from these bozos.Thanks a lot, Amazon.",0
5,"Essential device for the kitchen
  
",26.Dec.19,Yes,"We keep the Show 8 in our kitchen, where its visible from the stove and sink. We use it as a timer, to listen to music and to see family pictures when its idle. The family pictures are my personal favorite feature. I think the Echo 8 is the best mix of size (not to big, not too small) and audio quality. We also own three Show 5's which are sprinkled throughout the house.",0

",27.Dec.19,Yes,"How you plan on using the Echo Show 8 may determine whether you like the screen size or not. This is a perfect size for the kitchen and someone who uses it for recipes and actually viewing or reading information. But... If you plan on using it for a bedside clock and information screen, it might be a little too big. Go with the 5. Overall, I really enjoy these smart speakers.",0
5,"Best Smart Speaker
  
",27.Dec.19,Yes,"I bought the Amazon Echo Show for my parents as a holiday gift and they absolutely love it. They use it in their kitchen for timers, listening to music, hearing the weather, I even showed them how to add their doctor appointments to the calendar. I connected their mobile photos with the Amazon photo app, now they can see a slideshow of photos of the grandkids, which otherwise would have been stuck in their phone. It's a great present for someone you love or even for yourself. I Highly recommend this product.",1
4,"Overall, it does what I want it to.
  
",27.Dec.19,Yes,"I like it shows the video from my doorbell cam on command. It can drive me crazy sometimes when Alexa misunderstands me and gives me wrong info I didn't ask for or want. I've also noticed recently that sometimes it has trouble communicating with my other devices, like smart plugs, though half the time the other device responds anyway. Still, I'm glad of the reminders from my calendar, etc., to keep me on track.",0
3,"Good product, but bad UI and missing apps
  
",27.Dec.19,Yes,"I like the sound quality and screen on the device, but I have a lot of the same complaints as many others.The Things to Try suggestions can't be turned off despite what the top review says, the clock can't be made any bigger, and there aren't any apps for Netflix and YouTube. My Fire Stick has them, why doesn't this?All of this could be fixed with a software update, which is seriously needed.",1

",27.Dec.19,Yes,"I love this little unit.  I keep my Echo Show8 on my bedside table for use as an alarm clock. to view my Ring cameras, and to read my Kindle books, just before dozing off to sleep.  Why can't Prime members receive a minimal number of Audible books each month?I have an Echo Show5, that I keep on my desk to view the time, weather, and use to ask Alexa pertinent questions that I think of, while working at my computer.I have also noticed that the Alexa feature is ""learning"" the more I use ""her.""

",27.Dec.19,Yes,"Make sure that you have it someplace that is on obstructed all that way around, otherwise it won't pick up the voice commands. Ours was moved off the breakfast bar to the counter and now voice commands are not heard except in the kitchen. It can be frustrating because of its tendency to stop playing spotify playlists after a few songs, resume command  gets it going again (known issue for several years now).  Also wish they would make the annoying ""try this skill"" banner go away.",0

5,"Loving the Show 8
  
",27.Dec.19,Yes,This was a big upgrade for us from the Gen 1 Echo. So far we are loving it!  Was easy to set up and integrate with our Ring cameras which was the main reason for buying it.  Takes about three seconds to bring up the camera's witch is faster than viewing on the phone app or taking time to bring up on a computer. The sound quality is very good. In time we may replace all our Echo's with Show 8 units. The price was right for Christmas.,0
4,"Great Size Screen
  
",27.Dec.19,Yes,"We added this echo for a screen based experience in the kitchen. It is a great size for visibility without being so large as the Echo Show 10. Only bad issue is the sound quality is not quite as good as our Echo Plus. Other than that, it is a wonderful addition to our smart home setup.",0
5,"This little device is way more impressive than I expected
  
",27.Dec.19,Yes,What a pleasant surprise. To be able to play Amazon music and get the words in clear large type was a very positive surprise. To get many other Echo functions with the same addition is amazing. I am the limiting function - not the device. Very impressed.,0

5,"Worth the money!
  
",28.Dec.19,Yes,"I ordered this after loving the basic echo dots. We have 6 throughout our home and use them daily if not hourly. The show really is worth the extra money and counter space. I_ sure we are only using a fraction of what the Show is capable of, and can_ wait to discover more. Easy to use for kids (6 and 8) and adults. The best part is the photo background. Everyone is always looking and talking about the new pictures that popped up. Definitely worth it!",0
2,"Not for me
  
",28.Dec.19,Yes,"I own a Echo (1st gen), Google Nest Hub, Ecobee 4 and echo dot. Just recently got this. This is the my lest liked smart device in of the previously mentioned devices that have voice recognition. Alexa is not as intuitive as Google for voice integration for me. The larger screen of the show 8 is something that was suprising to me. I actually like it less than I do the smaller screens on the google Nest Hub and show 5. I got it because I thought I wanted a bigger screen and a better speaker. Both of these reason didn't pan out. If I wasn't so lazy I would return it for a second Google Nest hub or a straight echo speaker.The Far field mics on most Alexa devices are great including this one. Generally they have been better than Google devices in my experience, but what Alexa does with what you says has fallen behind google in my opinion.",0
5,"Alexa is looking pretty!
  
",28.Dec.19,Yes,"I replaced the original ""Alexa"" we had in our living room with this echo show. At first I felt guilty removing Alexa, especially since she was one of the original beta tester echoes. But Alexa had been knocked off of the end table one too many times by the cats, leaving her top a bit crooked and wonky. Although she did still sound great, sometimes she had a bit of trouble hearing and we found ourselves yelling and repeating ourselves one too many times, it was time to send her to the old hobby closet.This echo show 8 is very nice, it was super easy to set up and the picture quality and sound are excellent. Alexa responds quickly and I don't have to yell or repeat myself making my neighbors think a crazy lady lives here. I'm also happy I chose the 8 instead of the smaller 5. I enjoy the screen size, and along with a nice magnetic swivel stand I bought to go with it, it looks and fits great on the end table. It would also work great on the kitchen counter or anywhere else in the house.This echo works great with our security system, I just ask Alexa to ""show me -name of camera-"" and it's super easy to make calls and check your calendar and emails if you need to. Running smart home controls is also easy to do. Touch screen and voice control are both very responsive. I also love the slide lock button to block the camera when it's not in use, it kept me from having to place one more piece of black tape over a camera lens!The lighting also dims (can turn feature off in settings) as it gets darker so it doesn't light up the room at night. However you can still see the time dimly lit from across the room, I like this feature so I haven't checked to see if you can remove the time from showing when it's dark.I'm still getting to know what I can and cannot do with this echo show, but so far I'm loving it and I have no regrets whatsoever with my purchase.",0

1,"Exactly why does this have a screen again?
  
",28.Dec.19,Yes,"OK, so you have a device with a touchscreen that only runs skills built for Echo devices without a screen. The screen apparently is just used for a clock. How exactly is this useful again? My wife was very disappointed with her Christmas present, which will we shortly be on its way back to Amazon. Seriously, we don't expect much here, just for this thing to be able to run a simple cookbook app from the Fire store. They can't even get that right.",0
5,"So Far, So Good
  
",28.Dec.19,Yes,"Replaces the older model quite seamlessly. Haven't had it long enough, especially during the holidays, to try all the features. But ""she"" has answered all questions and played music well.  Haven't had a chance to watch videos yet, but I'll get to it.",0

5,"No Middle Child Syndrome Here - Step up from 5 and 10 &amp; gives the benefits of both
  
",28.Dec.19,Yes,"The Echo 8 may be getting a bad rap being in the middle of two other pretty cool Echo Shows. But for me, having multiple ""5s"" around, this larger screen and even bigger sound brought me joy. Video calling was great with the 5, but wow, video calling on the 8 is really cool and requires less shifting the device around to keep up with us folks constantly moving around. My only regret was purchasing this on a pre-order bundled with another Echo Show 5 at a discount. But ultimately, cost me a lot of money. Suddenly Amazon dropped the price of this one to less than $100. Kind of screwed all those who pre-ordered it at full price. Lesson learned - I will not be the early bird on new devices, because that ate my future Echo Show 10 money. Lo and behold, during Black Friday, the Echo Show 10 dropped to $149, and I jumped on it. A month later, and I am still frustrated with the full size 10 and have a return request open because it drops constantly and becomes unresponsive. The Echo 8 has blown the 10 away and sounds just as good. Disappointed in the full version, and loving the small one as a clock, the 8 has won me over as having the best of both worlds.",0

",28.Dec.19,Yes,"This is amazing, the sound is incredible, great for grocery lists and anything else you can think of.",0
2,"Already getting glitchy
  
",28.Dec.19,Yes,"This is my fourth Alexa device so I am familiar with how they work and our house is very integrated with Ring, Philips Hue, Honeywell and TVs. Also connected with dozens of skills.  The Show 8, within a month is starting to not support tasks. Example: _cho, play pandora (says ok, starts playing no problem). _cho, turn off music in 2 hours (says ok and repeats time to turn off). Then will not stop at time confirmed. 2nd example: if I verbally ask to then turn off music it does not respond. 3rd example. I manually turn the volume all the way to zero but it will after a period of time turn up the value on its own. 4 example: there is no way to make the screen fully black, so if your sensitive to blue light it is still very bright in the room, even after using the night settings. Sunrise settings are terrible also. Returning.",0
5,"Love the Echo Show 8!
  
",28.Dec.19,Yes,This product is an amazing addition to our kitchen. We are able to ask Alexa all sorts of things and have it help us all around the house. What's more is that it helps bring the family together with features like the announcement that goes across the house.,0
5,"LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!!
  
",28.Dec.19,Yes,"This was my Christmas present to myself. I'm a HUGE Alexa girl. I love that while I'm cooking that it can help me with a recipe (THIS DEVICE IS A MUST HAVE IN THE KITCHEN). I also love that I can watch a movie while in the kitchen now. I wanted a small TV in the kitchen but all of them that I found I found were just too big. This fits right on top of my microwave. The sound and video quality are amazing! I'm 100% happy with mine. As far as the ""Alexa, try..."" issue that people are having I actually love! It gives me some great suggestions that I would of never thought of. It's not intrusive and it's barely even noticeable unless you are looking for it. The device comes with a ton of options too. This is my first Echo Show but I'm 100% happy with it. NEXT COMES THE RING!!!! :D",1

4,"It has a decent size screen.
  
",28.Dec.19,Yes,"What I like about the Echo Show 8. What I most like is that it has a display. I already had a echo 1st generation and a echo Plus. I put off buying the echo dot due to it_ tiny size screen, so I decided to purchase the Echo Show 8 due it_ screen size and sales price which included a free echo dot. Naturally the Echo Show 8 does everything the other echos does, but it has the advantage of having a screen to see some features you couldn_ see on the other_ such as news videos when listening to your Flash briefings. You also have access t Tubi  (no account required) which is good if you done mine watching long programs on a 8 screen and others channels such as Hulu, NBC, Prime video, and kitchen all of which requires account linking.I also like that you can download pictures from your phone or Amazon cloud account and add them as background photos show.It_ also nice to have the ability to see the other person you call when both have echo devices with videos capabilities, leaving my phone free for other use.Resuming; what I most like of the echo show 8 is that it has a decent size screen which is the only thing that distinguish it from the others echo devices which does not have a screen. Voice recognition is no better then the others echo devices and I find the the sound quality is not better then the sound I got from my Echo plus even if it does have stereo 2.5 speakers on either side.What I most find disturbing of the Echo Show 8 is the Constance, annoying messages which appears at the bottom on the screen and which their isn_ any way to eliminate. Amazon please do a download update within the menu options to turn this feature OFF. It is stressing me out.",0

I use this in our master bedroom for typical Alexa stuff (controlling lights/lamps in our room, playing music, weather checks, _how me the front door with Ring doorbell, news updates, so on). I can confirm the speaker and sound from Echo Show 8 is better in absolutely every way compared to first gen. This is obviously expected as Amazon has upped their game in audio. I have the second gen Echo Show in our kitchen and love these two Echo Shows. I think back to 2014 when I first got my hands on the original Echo. This whole ecosystem has evolved so well for the most part (they do have some duds in the line-up). If you_e considering the Echo Show 5 versus the 8, I would recommend the 8. It_ not going to take up nearly as much room as the Echo Show, and the difference in sound quality and extra few inches of screen versus the 5 is obvious. It_ a good in-between option and I_ thrilled Amazon launched this version.

",29.Dec.19,Yes,"I bought this device to use as a way to upgrade one of my seven Echo Dots to see my Ring camera and to use as an electronic picture frame.  I'm very disappointed with the quality of photos streamed from my Amazon Prime Photos account to this device.  They are washed out and have a slight green cast.  There are no controls that allow me to improve the quality of the photos as they appear on the Show's screen.  While the quality of whats displayed is very disappointing, even more annoying is the fact that there is a text line toward the bottom of the screen announcing things for you to try on your Alexa device.  I feel like I've purchased an on going commercial for Alexa.  There is not a setting to turn this text line off and when I called the Amazon Show help line they did not have an answer for either of these issues.  Until Amazon address both of these issues I cannot recommend buying a Show 8"" HD device to anyone.",2

Grandkids, vacations, everyday life, scenery, our pets, etc. (that led to me discovering that now I can get prints made by Amazon....just had an enlargement sent straight to _reat-grandma easy peasy).I also love the lyrics that scroll along with the music so we can join in and actually get the words right!  Also the weather and sports scores show up intermittently.  All this in addition to Alexa.  Plus, a couple of the kids plan to get these, so we will be able to video chat with them.

The kids absolutely love them! Setup was a snap and after reading a few recent reviews making the ""tasks"" from displaying all the time was easy. The kids also like the live video calling feature to call each other. To put it simply, we love it so much we're going to purchase the 10"" for the Kitchen area.

Unfortunately, in comparison to the 1st Gen Echo Show i realized that the far-field microphones are sometimes not picking up commands or are totally misunderstood. My first gen Echo Show had never any problems, even from the other side of the room to understand and get everything.Even when the wake up word is understood, then Alexa just stays idle and just doesn't to anything:""Alexa, add Bananas to my shopping list"" was misunderstood. Adding other items sometimes, Alexa stopped after the wake-up word.I have realized that the Echo Show 8 is very sensitive to background noises, i.e. while the first gen Echo Show did understand everything with a lots of background noises (somebody speaking on the phone or my kids playing), this version of the Echo Show 8 leads to ""Alexa confusions"", so it can't realize if this is a command or a background noise.Sound quality. I can't understand the reviews about the sound quality from some people here. It is correct that the Echo Show 1st gen did not create a room-filling sound quality. However, in comparison, my old Echo Show sounded in general a lot better and louder (probably due to the Dolby).I will try to retrain the voice models for my two users although when i connect my old Echo Show (1st Gen) back i don't have any problems with recognition of voice commands. If this doesn't get the speech recognition fixed, i'll probably return it and keep waiting for the next gen of Echo Shows.",1
5,"Great
  
",29.Dec.19,Yes,We purchased one for all in family.  My son who is handicapped and bedridden is able to use his device due to Alexa he really enjoys the fact that he can ask her for time.  lol more independence for him.,0
5,"Music and Photos With Built in Video - What's Not to Love
  
",30.Dec.19,Yes,"After 16 years of marriage my husband I have arrived at a stage in our life where gift giving is no longer relegated to birthdays and holidays because we have the disposable income of an established couple with no children. In short, if we want something, we buy it. Christmas gift giving was once an ungodly stressful event  until we decided to stop with the gifts. This year however, I saw the Echo Show and decided to take a chance and surprise my favorite spouse with a present for his work office. He loves having family photos on display, but his iPad is old and does not always connect to the very secure office network and he enjoys playing music, but he needs to have his phone available for calls and his work computer is a PC and cannot hold personal files. The Show is really the perfect solution.When he opened the box his first reaction was suspicion because our house is currently overflowing with Alexas. We have so many Alexas in fact that there is an unopened Dot on our dining room table, we sent two brand new Dots to my brother and we have an older Dot that will be needing a new home after its replacement arrives next week. Once I started to explain the features of the Show a bit of excitement started to build. I knew I had him hooked when he plugged it in immediately and asked Alexa to play music and the lyrics popped up on the screen so he could sing along. ""This is pretty cool.""Then he started tweaking the settings and the home screen and added a background photo. It was all very easy. I use Amazon Photo storage as a backup tool for all of my family photographs. There are currently around 20,000 photos that are thankfully loosely organized into albums. I spent a good 4 hours creating a new 250 photo Echo Show album and then because my husband is a family vault member and can see all of my photos he can add photos to the album. The slideshow feature is really his favorite part of the whole Show. He loves the music, he loves Alexa, but he really loves having photos on his desk.The Echo Show's first week in his office was a success and when his boss stopped by his office, she loved the Show so much she ordered her own. My husband is able to listen and sing along to his music and see his family. We ordered a Show for our kitchen and my parents ordered one for their kitchen so we can easily make video calls between all of us during the day. Now if anyone can tell me what to do with all of these Dots, I would really appreciate it.",0

",30.Dec.19,Yes,Got as a gift. I like to listen to music. Will use as facetime with my daughter.,0
4,"Better than the Dots!
  
",30.Dec.19,Yes,Have the Echo Show 8 right by my Living Room chair and use it often.  Can_ wait for baseball season to have Alexa show me updates on scores.  There is quite a bit to learn but just ask Alexa and she _sually show/do things for you. I like the evolving skills with Alexa and she recognizes both my wife and my voice and connects to our respective accounts.  Much better and more fun than the Dots!!  Wait for deals for a decent and lower price!,0
5,"Great Product to Relieve Anxiety
  
",30.Dec.19,Yes,"I bought the Echo Show as a Christmas gift to the family a couple of weeks ago. That was what they thought at least. The Show is great whenever I need to drop in on my dogs to make sure they aren't causing complete havoc in my household. Sure, the video quality is great and the sound is fantastic but I cannot stress how much I love the drop in feature to make sure my kids aren't destroying the house while I'm gone or to guarantee that the dogs haven't collectively figured out how to loot the fridge. I highly recommend this product.",0
5,"Better than Echo 1st &amp; 2nd Gen. and much better than any Echo Dot--a BUY!
  
",30.Dec.19,Yes,"I bought this with a sense of guilt because I already had Echos in the bedroom and living room and Dots in the bathroom and den. But, am I ever happy that I made the purchase.  I placed it in the living room instead of the 1st generation Echo (one that I pre-ordered before any were even shipped!).  The sound quality was MUCH more to my liking,  The Echos, especially the Dots, sound rather muddy to me, even with my excellent hearing aids (I have high-frequency drop-off).  But, this 8"" Show is very clear, and it easily fills a living room-dining room area.  I like that the screen dims in a dark room, meaning that I might splurge on a second Show for my bedroom to get better sound.  I also like that when I play selections from TuneIn Radio, the artwork shows on the screen. But, there are times when I would like to just return the screen to a persistent plain one, like whenit shows time and weather.  That's my only real objection.  I am about to make a demo of Alexa products to a senior living community, and be assured that I will feature this Echo Show.  This is a definite BUY!",0
4,"So far so good
  
",30.Dec.19,Yes,I docked 1 star because I feel like there should be more video type skills to add to your Show.  I also think that its greatly missing a feature of casting or sending webpages to your show from your phone.  My wife wanted to use a recipe that she found on her phone and was unable to figure out how to get it on the show.  Overall the device is great and we like having it.,0
5,"They got it right
  
",30.Dec.19,Yes,"I have an echo show 5, which like baby Yoda, needed to learn a few things.the echo 8 is the big brother who finished collage and is ready for prime time.Great features, and voice recognition that WORKS.Great for a kitchen (where I have mine)",0
5,"Alexa gets even better
  
",30.Dec.19,Yes,"I have only had this for a few days, but I love it. Matching visual with Alexa's voice is so much better. I love that it accesses my Ring doorbell fairly fast. It shows lyrics when playing music. I can talk to my daughter, (who is 2 states away) face-to-face with ease. I can see the weather forecast as well as hear it. I'm excited to find out what else I can do.",0
5,"Definitely a must-have
  
",30.Dec.19,Yes,I have the first gen in the big 10 inch of this and I loved it so much. I have it in my kitchen I've had it for 2 years now. I wanted one for my bedroom and the 8in is the perfect size. Absolutely love these devices. I have one more on the way to place in my laundry room so that I can listen to music while folding my laundry or to video chat with someone that may call or ring my doorbell. I love the fact that I can drop in on any device throughout my home and check in with a camera. I highly recommend these to anyone who likes a smart home. I have it connected to my security system as well and all my echo dots throughout my home.,0
5,"Alexa does everything you ask her to do.
  
",30.Dec.19,Yes,I love It! The set up was in seconds. I have Ring.com so I asked Alexa show me the front door and Wham!! I have an echo and a the bigger one. They are all  great!! She did..quick. The bass on this sounds great! I asked to play songs and video's with no issues. I went in to settings and stop all the Alexa advertisement and etc.,0
5,"Dont LIsten to Try Alexa Compliant Reviews
  
",30.Dec.19,Yes,I love this item. It does everything you would want. It has Alexa Integration. It has prime video and prime music. You have a Ring doorbell? It works with that too. People giving it 1 or 2 star reviews only because it has a Try Alexa message are being nit picky at best. You can make it so it only shows up on the home screen. People make it seem likes its always on display even while watching prime video or watching Ring Doorbell footage. It's not. It isn't a deal breaker for me and it shouldn't be for you either. Get this device. You wont regret it.,1
5,"Echo Show 8 on top of 5 and 10
  
",30.Dec.19,Yes,"I now have a Echo Show 5, 10 and 8, having just bought the 8.  I am sort of using the 5 as an alarm clock on my nightstand. The 10 is in the study with my PC and the 8 is going to replace the 5 mostly for the better sound and video quality improvements.  I like the Show 8 much better than the 5 for just those reasons.  The 10 is too big to do much with.",0
4,"Echo Show 8, a nice smaller size
  
",30.Dec.19,Yes,"I own two Echo Show 2nd Gen devices.  The Echo Show 8 makes a nice desktop edition with a slightly smaller screen.

4,"Size does matter!
  
",30.Dec.19,Yes,"I owned an echo show before, the thinner one and loved it as an alarm clock.  It bothered me that the pictures I stream in the background were cropped.  This solves that issue.  It is a little bright for an alarm clock according to my wife, but other than that we love it.  It is big enough to actually watch shows or movies on it bedside.  The audio could use a little more quality.",0
5,"Perfect Gift for Seniors
  
",30.Dec.19,Yes,"I purchased  4 of Echo Show8 and gave them to senior females in their mid 70s in hopes of improving their quality of life by being able to interact and be entertained. It is heart warming to see these ladies use this device_ features. Music lets them reminisce about yester-year, seeing family faces on screen let_ them feel connected, Alexa_ jokes give them topic to repeat later that day, the weather locally and internationally is useful and provides another current topic for daily discussion. We did sound checks throughout their houses and or nursing home room and were pleasantly surprised that Alexa could successfully hear and call the person the senior said. This is a great safety feature in the event of a fall.",0
4,"Good product!!
  
",30.Dec.19,Yes,I really like the echo show but I would love the camera to face me and not face the ceiling. Overall it is a good product.,0

",30.Dec.19,Yes,"I would like to tell you about sound quality, responsivness to voice commands, picture quality, build quality etc. BUT I CAN""T BECAUSE THERE IS NO WAY TO TURN OFF THE ANNOYING AND DISTRACTING ""TRY"" FEATURE COVERING UP MY PHOTOS!!! You would think Amazon would listen to the thousands of users searching desperately in every corner of that Interweb magical space thingy for a way to turn it off but I guess Amazon knows more about what we want more than we do. Total fail.",0
3,"Bigger but not at lot  better...than the the Echo 5. Worse in some cases
  
",30.Dec.19,Yes,"If your main reason for buying the Echo 8 is a bigger screen, go for it.  It does that about as well as you would expect.  Everything else, except perhaps sound quality, puts it behind the Echo 5 in terms of quality and extras.The screen, while larger, seems a bit washed out to me, compared to the 5. You have far fewer customization options in terms of clock faces and backgrounds.  You would expect better sound quality given the larger cabinet and (presumably) larger speaker. But it's really not that much better. Marginally perhaps.Also, since it has a bigger screen and the same wedge form factor as the 5, the entire device is much much larger, which might not make it suitable in places where space is at a premiumI wanted it mainly for the kitchen, for calling up recipes, which are easier to see, with less scrolling, than on the smaller Echo 5 screen. Mission accomplished there, although it is so large, it barely fits where I wanted to put. And was a bit disappointed at all the other downgrades.One upside it it seems to handle wakeup better than the 5. Not sure why but the 5 always seemed a bit hard of hearing.  Perhaps because I have so many other Alexa devices scattered about the house and they were all fighting for control. The whole ESP thing that is supposed to make the closest one respond didnt work very well with the 5. This one is very responsive unless there is a lot of ambient noise.",1
5,"Worth the extra money over the 5
  
",30.Dec.19,Yes,"Ive tried all the echos that have a screen and the echo 8 is more impressive than i was expecting. The echo 5 is a great alarm clock replacement. The size allows it to fit well on a night stand and its handy for smart device control, podcast, video chat but its limited in what videos it can play and the sound isnt anything to write home about. The echo 8 breaks free of all the negative aspects of the echo 5. If you are looking for something to watch video on and listen to music the echo 8 is a much better choice. The volume is louder and the bass is surprisingly good for this type of device. You can feel the bass. It also playa hulu and more video options than the echo 5. Its not a fire tv replacement as not all video apps work on the echo shows. The big echo obviously has a larger screen and its significantly more expensive. If watching video is your top concern stick to the 10 inch or the echo 8. If having a bedside smart device to control smart devices, wake you up and use for communication the echo 5 is the best option. The echo 5 is surprisingly unobtrusive on the nightstand where as the echo 8 is pretty noticeable. The echo 8 is a great value at the current sale price. If your on the fence buy it! You won_ regret it. I wish i had a need for another given the price.",0
5,"The best
  
",30.Dec.19,Yes,Super happy with this my kid loves it,0
5,"So far, I love it!
  
",31.Dec.19,Yes,"First, Amazon, please get rid of the ""things to try"". It's annoying and it takes away from a clean streamline screen.That being said, it's great! The screen is a nice size. I didn't want to pay double for 2 more inches and loose the ability to turn off the camera. The sound quality out of the box is quite flat, yet bassy. The equalizer fixes that really quick. I've seen reviews complaining about the sound quality, I don't see the problem. Yes it sounds different from the Echo 1st and 2nd gen, but it's built different. I have mine in the kitchen. I'm not sure how it would sound being the lone speaker in a living room. I couldn't find the browser at first. Duh, you have to tell her to open it, lol. Silk or Firefox is your choice. The touchscreen seems normally responsive (I wish I could say the same for my Fire tablet)Very happy with my purchase.",0
3,"Not What I Had Hoped
  
",31.Dec.19,Yes,"I decided to add an Echo show to my group.  I primarily want it as a sleep sound alarm clock, but I like the other features of Echo, too.  HOWEVER, the constant jabbering of things I should try or buy or check out is so stinking annoying!  I have found myself yelling at a box saying, ""Alexa, shut up and listen!""  and ""Alexa, I don't need an advertisement every time I ask you to do something.""  I have to say, if I had known how ANNOYING this machine is, I would not have bought it.  One final thing...as tons of others have said, I hate the messages at the bottom of the screen saying try this skill or that skill.  I really just want to be left alone, Alexa.  I am more than an entity to be advertised to, thank you very much.",0

4,"Beware offer to Trade-In (updated 1/9/20)
  
",31.Dec.19,Yes,"Love this Echo Show.  It has a  much larger screen and I can easily read it from across the room.  The only issue I have is that I am disappointed with the Upgrade and Trade-in discount which offered me $30 instant credit if I sent in my old unit.  My old unit sat untouched on a table for a year.  It was like new out of the box when I sent it in.  I wrapped it in bubble wrap and newspaper and dropped it off at UPS.  Now they rejected the suggested $30 discount and have charged my credit card.  The reason?  Scratches.  Absolutely no way there was a single scratch on that unit.  I'll be interested in seeing the condition it's in when it is returned.  I won't every use that Ugrade and Trade-in offer again.Update:  After a couple of weeks I just received my old unit back.  I was anxious to see the ""scratches"" that they claimed were the reason they didn't accept it.  Of course, there weren't ANY, not a single scratch.  But the best part, wait for it... is that they returned it without the cord.  So now, if I want to sell it I have to buy a $15 cord for it.  This trade-in program is a scam and I am really surprised Amazon is okay with it.  Basically, they lure you in with a higher amount and ask you to ok ahead if they feel it is worth less (which it always is, I'm sure).  If like me you don't agree to take a lower value then they just ship it back to you.  Beware!",0

3,"Show vs Nest - I now have both
  
",31.Dec.19,Yes,"Ok I_ not a highly knowledgeable person when it comes to tech, but I_ not a novice either. I actually bought the Show 8 and the Google Nest Hub at the same time because they were priced the same. I figured I would keep the better of the two. Nest arrived first so I set it up first. Setup was incredibly easy (I already have a nest mini), eventually easier than the Show. I also have a gmail account so that speeds up things on the Nest as well. I wasn_ keeping my photos on Google but it was pretty quick to add favorites in one folder and the Nest is now a digital photo frame. I have it on my nightstand because when you turn out the lights it really does go dark as well with a hint of the time showing - in full screen size. I am VERY sensitive to light at night and this doesn_ bother me at all. I also really like the _ood morning routine that you set up in the Nest better than the Show. It_ simple enough to ask and get info right before walking out the door.Once the Show arrived I did the setup thinking it would be easy as I have 3 dots and an Echo already. So yeah, setup went ok until you explore thinking ALL the reviews are wrong and you CAN turn off the _ry this feature. The answer is NO, you can_. I have every part that should turn it off switched to off (even on the app). Constant _ry this on the screen. It_ ALWAYS there. And there is a list of what seems like a 100 _ards so it never runs out. The software must_e changed because all of the offered suggestions to turn it off aren_ accurate for what is currently possible. If you don_ care about that/wouldn_ bother you, then choose the unit that dominates your home or the website you use the most.So which is better? Meh, they_e about the same IMO. My sons and I usually have them compete with each other to see which one can answer a question accurately or with the best info. Lately there_ no clear winner on that, but Google is usually easier to understand. The Show does NOT go completely dark at night so I could never have it on my nightstand and the clock is never full screen so that_ annoying too. I have added a seasonal photo image on my amazon photo account using a computer so it_ decorative in the living room. I_ going to be installing a video doorbell myself soon and some interior cameras so I_l update my review when those gadgets are added to compare use. Reviews I_e read online say both units will work fine on both the doorbell and cameras so I_l to do the installation to judge it.",1

I am not alone in this, as Amazon's own forums and many blogs online also feel that this nag should be controllable by the user. Amazon has been telling people who complain about it that they will pass it on to ""the development team""... they have been saying that since the first device in late 2017!

I expect that I'll eventually buy a couple more to replace earlier, more limited Echo devices I own that are spread around my home.

",2.Jan.20,Yes,"I bought this to compliment my Blink XT2 and I've read so many posts that it does not connect correctly, or only has audio feed but no video feed. Here's a few tips to get it to work properly. 1.) Make sure you have a strong wifi connection with proper bandwidth. 2.) Set your video quality resolution on the XT2's app to ""Saver"". There is a small noticeable difference in resolution/definition but if you want to show live video, this feature must be set to Saver mode for it to work. Until Blink or Echo Show updates it to accept high res. This is the only work around. The speaker is phenomenal, full amd rich that's comparable to the Echo itself. Go with the 8 rather than 5... better speakers and bigger screen. Hope this helps!",0

",2.Jan.20,Yes,"I found this the most natural Echo device to set up so far. Everything I have tried so far works flawlessly. It tells me my commute, my daily itinerary, makes calls, tells me when dinner is ready, and when to wakeup. I am excited to try more features as I find the time.",0
4,"5 vs 8
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,I had the echo show 5 and decided to upgrade. Overall I do like the 8. Bigger screen is great. Improved speaker is a plus. The problem I have is it doesn_ hear me call _lexa and I have to yell louder.  Also the clock display need more customization like the 5.  You can_ even put the date on there.  Only time and weather.  That bites bad.  Hope they do software update and fix this. As long as they fix these issues it will be a solid device better than 5. But until then. My 5 is a better performer.,1
3,"Keeps dropping Bluetooth Connection to FireTVStick, no full screen clock
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,"I have couple of Show5s and one Show 8. Overall  great package for the price, better (not hi fidelity though) sound than Show5. Couple of negatives based on my usage needs -Show5 has Clock faces that fill the entire screen allowing it it be used as a big Clock at night and able to view it from far. For some reason, these options are not available on Show8I planned to use this device as speakers for my FireTV stick and projector. It pairs well and FireTV streams sound to the device but  drops connection. It has to repaired back after rebooting Show 8 everytime. Which is very frustrating.",0
5,"Good device... poor support
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,I just spent an hour on the phone with a rep that told me the only option was drop in and that you could not call another echo device. I thought that was stupid to allow other free access to your device. Once off I tried to just call and it works and they have to answer. I asked the rep specifically if you had an option to answer and was told no.,0
5,"Thank you Alexa
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,I love my Echo Show 8! I have had more fun learning everything she can do.Whst I really like about all the Alexa's is you can tell her thank you and she will respond.  I love that!,0
4,"Echo Show 8 could be better
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,"I purchased and echo show 8 for the living room and an echo show 5 for the bedroom. Set up for both was easy and came linked to my Prime. I set up the show 5 first and found the software interface to be very friendly and lots of features that suited my needs. I especially liked the various clock selections. Went into settings and turned off all of the options for notifications which seemed to minimize the ""try alexa"" messages on the display. Went to set up the show 8 and was disappointed to find that the software is different than the show 5. Most noticeable is the lack of selections of clocks and backgrounds. I like both but wish the software in the echo 8 was the same as the echo 5. Both are linked to my Blink cameras, Gosund smart plugs and switches, Our Groceries app, and Vizio TV. Really enjoying our echo 5 and 8.",0
5,"Best value for your money in the Echo Show ecosystem
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,"I've got all three Echo Show devices - full sized 2nd Gen, Echo Show 5, and now the Echo Show 8. I love all three of them, as each fills a specific niche in my home. Dollar-for-dollar, though, the Echo Show 8 is the best value. Uses the same resolution as the full sized model, and has comparable sound quality. Has all the same functionality as the 2nd gen, plus the added feature of having a physical camera cover, as opposed to the camera being software controlled on the 2nd Gen model. Fits nicely on my desk without getting in the way. The 2nd-Gen is the best of the lot, of course, but  the 8-inch model is a great choice on a budget.",0
5,"Excellent
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,"It is well worth the money. You can ask Alexa a lot of questions that you may not know answers to. I bought two of them one for myself and one for my daughter that moved to Las Vegas,Si we can call each other and FaceTime.",0
5,"It just keeps surprising!
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,"It just keeps surprising!  I have it integrated with my hulu live service and was only a little disappointed that I didn't have Weather Channel or Weather Nation, until I remembered the ""Stream Player"" skill.  That added a whole bunch more pluses to an already great device!",0

1,"Dishonest advertisement on Ech Show 8
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,Ordered Dec 27th as a Special offer with an Echo Dot included. There was a choice for color only. Received the Show 8 without the Dot that was in the offer.  I called customer service and was told there was supposed to be an option that should have been chosen to receive the FREE Dot. There was no option. CS representative checked on a separate order also placed by my son at same time. His order also shows NO Free Dot.  Amazon advertised a Free Dot to be included with the purchase of the Echo Show 8 and did NOT follow through.,0

",2.Jan.20,Yes,Product is great.,0
5,"Every household should have an echo8
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,"Received this as a Christmas gift and just love it,, It does not replace my small echo dot but is used with it in a different room. I replaced 2 old radios that were very static and hard to listen to, now with echo8 we can enjoy many things with alexa.",0

5,"Lives up to its Hype &amp; more thus Far!
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,"The Echo Show 8 is better than what I expected. It's well built, but the sound quality blows me away! It has a lot of bass for its size. It has integrated well with my Smart Home devices. I'm learning more each day of what this Echo 8 is capable of. It is fast on voice commands and I like the news &amp; suggestions it offers. My wife &amp; I really like it a lot!!",0
5,"PERFECT SWEET SPOT ECHO SHOW! Great size and sound! Bargain for its price!
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,"The Echo Show 8 is the perfect size Echo Show for an area thats not too big, but still a main/populated area of your living space. The price of the full sized Echo Show runs $230 and $199 on sale, while the Echo Show 8 is $130 full price and $80 with free Echo Dot when on sale. The $80 price tag is insanely good for the speaker and screen quality.While I do wish it was more customizable like others have said as for removing the _ry This im sure it will happen eventually and every single person mentioning it is redundant. The Echo Show 5 is a worthless paper weight as for its speaker and screen size, its smaller then most current phone screens, and sounds like trash. As for a bedroom clock, or background music, or digital picture frame for the bedroom it may serve a purpose, it doesnt have a place anywhere else really. The Echo Show 8, while only being 2.5 bigger, is a perfect size for a main room that doesnt have a big enough space to dedicate to the full size Echo Show, or as a cheaper alternative, or as a secondary Echo Show. I will strongly recommend this to everyone interested in Echo Show devices, as I cannot justify more then double the price for 2 more of screen, and almost the same exact speaker performance this is the sweet spot!",0
4,"Pretty amazing technology. Major upgrade for my echo dot gen2
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,"There's so much that Echo can do now, and many things it can't - like integrate fully with Viber to make calls.  Skype integration needs more work to improve performance.  The $10 guide should be included in the box.  Who ships a product without instructions?  Amazon... that's who.  Not everything is electronic - particularly if you don't know what to look for online on how to get the full value out of this product.  The speakers and sound quality falls a little short of expectation, but it's a major improvement over the dot.  You shouldn't have to buy the echo show and a separate speaker system to get the full sound that should have been built in.  I'm not saying that it should sound like a Bose, but something better than a portable radio should be the standard.  The screen quality is very very good.That said, it's a great product if you can get it at the sale price ($79).  Don't pay full price.... wait for the periodic sales events to buy this device.",0
4,"Great Kitchen Assistant
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,"This device is front and center on our kitchen counter. I use it primarily to pull up recipes, listen to music and turn on/off a variety of lights/devices in our home which are on smart plugs. I've had it for a little less than a month and am by no means familiar with all of it's capabilities.For online recipes it's terrific. I can ask it to find a recipe for X on website Y (or just look across the web), and it'll display all the relevant recipes. I can scroll through them, then pick one to see the details. It even links the ingredients to the shopping list in the Alexa app. When using a recipe, the display stays open and you can easily scroll through the different steps. It sits at an angle which makes it easy to read ( I didn't get a stand). Much better than using my tablet, which times out after a few minutes, so I have to keep logging in.For music, it visually displays all the available playlists, which I can scroll through and pick one. It displays the current song and performer. So much easier than using an Echo Dot. I was using a Dot together with my phone; this combines the capabilities of the two.I bought this to experiment with before buying some others as gifts for family members. Ultimately I want to use these as an easy way to visually connect with family.",0
1,"Will not register.
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,This Echo Show 8 will not register to my account. No matter what I do and Amazon is not much help.,0
5,"Definitely an upgrade over the old Echo Show!
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,"This Show 8 has the same size viewing screen as the original Show I had in my kitchen (that just died after a couple years).  I like it a lot!  The screen resolution is much improved and the sound is great.  It IS much lower to the counter than the old one because the old one had the screen above a speaker.  I decided to move this one to my master bathroom and get the new generation Show 10 for the kitchen.  Since I know it will sit lower on the counter and it needs to be seen over a lazy susan, I purchased a stand to raise it higher.  I am quite happy with this addition to my Alexa-enabled home.",0
4,"Great kitchen companion...
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,"Upgraded from a Show 5 to the Show 8. Perfect size for the kitchen companion. Show 5 is better suited for a nightstand/alarm clock. Better sound, better and bigger picture. So far so good with the upgrade. If only it would as more video services for watching streaming content. As far as I know only Prime Video and Tubi are currently supported.",0
5,"Totally satisfied
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,Very good product,0
3,"Great product but for the night clock
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,Wish the clock that displays at night is bigger. I had an Echo Show 5 and was expecting that the clock would display larger with the Show 8. This is very disappointing.,0
4,"Good kitchen accessory
  
",3.Jan.20,Yes,"Alexa is very helpful for music, the news and finding recipes. You can ask Alexa to find a recipe for just about anything and she will give you list to select from. She can show you any of your smart home security cameras and find most videos that I look for.The only reason I took off 1 star is that Alexa is not even close to as good as google. She cannot find most of the things I ask for. I would say if they improve her search functions I will give it the 5th star in an update.",0

",3.Jan.20,Yes,"I have not even utilized most of the features available on the Echo Show 8, but I still love it! I don_ know why people complain so much about the messages across the bottom of the screen. It_ not like you are staring at the screen all day! The scenery changes during the day so it_ not the same screen or you can customize it. I just love being able to view things while hearing about it by Alexa. My favorite so far are the recipes, but it shares news articles that I wouldn_ have seen if it weren_ for the _ry This tips showing across the bottom of the screen. The screen is HD and looks really great even watching YouTube and music videos. I love the video call feature as well. It_ just a great product that I would recommend to anyone!",0

5,"So glad I purchased
  
",3.Jan.20,Yes,"I LOVE the Show 8, I have no complaint. My 8 year old Granddaughter set it up for me, it's that simple. The images on screen are sharp and clear, her voice is the same. It integrated with my other Alexa devices without issue and to date has been so much fun. My Grandgirls have played all sort of games and watch several program from Amazon Prime, they enjoy it very much. I'm still learning all that Alexa can do and help me with. I ask if she could clean my house. She said she would but didn't have arm, so to compensate, she offered to play 'Cleaning' music.  It made me laugh, the music was great but didn't motivate me to get things done. Oh, I forgot, it works exceptionally with the Ring. I highly recommend purchasing, you won't be disappointed.",0
4,"Only disappointed as it was not clear that this model didn't have the show feature.
  
",3.Jan.20,Yes,"I originally bought this for my wife, who is blind, to use the show feature which was advertised to describe things held in front of the camera.  Apparently this feature is on the first generation and the second generation but not on this model. I subsequently bought a second generation for my wife and kept this one for myself.  I like how it will display the lyrics on many songs it plays. The sound quality is very good. I have not watched video on it as I use my Fire for that.",0
1,"Try feature sucks
  
",3.Jan.20,Yes,"It is too bad that Amazon would ruin an okay product by making it impossible to stop the stupid ""Try"" suggestions on the home screen.  ""Try:  How do I make meatballs?

",3.Jan.20,Yes,"My main purpose for the purchase was to video call with family. It_ nice to be able to see them while talking to them. My only issue, sometimes hard to hear/understand the sound/voice breaks up. But overall nice purchase for the price, speaker sounds good for music, again, for the price. Love all the things Alexa can do but mostly that I can feel like I_ sitting in my moms living room talking to her. She lives 1200 miles away.",0
5,"Just buy one already!
  
",3.Jan.20,Yes,"My wife loves it. She uses it in the kitchen every day. Also we integrated our Wyze security cameras, TV, weather station, Ring, and lights. We bought one for the bedroom as well. It_ not meant to be a tablet replacement in my opinion. It_ a new category of smart devices to upgrade and automate your home.",0
4,"Alexa is here to stay.
  
",3.Jan.20,Yes,"So far so good. Alexa has been helpful with my little set up. Always handy for asking questions (it's a little sad that she keeps my company). However, like other users I find the ""try alexa....."" to the bottom of the screen a bit irritating. I also thought this new device had a built in hub, no such luck. But I guess that was my error. I am fascinated that I'm learning and finding out more features/skills everyday, so all in all.....I am satisfied with the device",0

4,"Don't like ads
  
",4.Jan.20,Yes,"After having the Alexa around for about two years, I was disappointed in the echo show. I don't like ads running on my screen, or voices to go along with the ads. I am pissed that Amazon takes a good idea and then uses it to spread garbage and unwanted ads on the screen. Shame on them! I was excited about having lyrics with my songs, and still be able to ask questions, and get the answers. That is great, but the ads suck, so I had to down grade the review this time. Sorry. : (",0

They decided it was not functioning right and sent me a RECONDITIONED one when i payed for a BRAND NEW one. Thank you amazon for ruining my christmas and gender reveal........

",4.Jan.20,Yes,"It_ nice and it works - but I find the interface limiting and a little confusing.  I thought it would do more but for what it is but I guess my expectations were too high.

",4.Jan.20,Yes,"Love this. So much more useful than timers. I can turn different lights on/off and even schedule them. I can also control them with my voice or through the app in my phone.  I bought my parents these with Echos for Christmas. Because these make lights handsfree, they're perfect for elderly that need their hands for walker stability. They also love being able to use their voices to turn on/off their lights at night. I bought Echo shows to check on my parents too. I can sleep while listening to make sure they're ok after coming home from the hospital. Paired with the Ring doorbell, they can talk and see the nurses and caregivers.",0
5,"The sound and size are perfect!
  
",4.Jan.20,Yes,"Prior to purchasing the Echo Show, I had the Echo Spot and was looking to trade it in for something newer. The Echo Shows were on sale and I was offered decent money to trade in the Echo Spot from Amazon, so I went for it. I wasn_ sure if I should get the Echo Show 5 or 8 to use as a replacement alarm clock and radio in the bedroom. I went with the Echo Show 8 and I am so happy with the purchase. I was nervous that it might be too big or too loud. The size is perfect and it sits on a night stand with a lamp next to the bed. The sound is amazing!!! The bass is also incredible! Best part is at night I don_ like the radio too loud and the Echo Show 8 has the perfect low sound too. The camera shut off feature is key. The dimming feature works great so the light doesn_ bother you while sleeping. I highly recommend the Echo Show 8 and don_ be afraid that it_ too much for a bedroom. You_l be able to have a dance party during the day and listen to soothing music as you sleep at night. One of my favorite Amazon purchases to date!",0
5,"Doesn_ recognize/respond to voice
  
",4.Jan.20,Yes,Sometimes she doesn_ respond to my voice when I call her - I have to (at times) use a specific tone for her to respond.,0
3,"Good device, flawed software by Amazon
  
",4.Jan.20,Yes,"The Echo Show 8 is a good piece of hardware marred by a software design that makes you scratch your head, largely because the numerous requests and feedback from users of the larger Show is largely ignored in this implementation.The display is great, the built in pictures are also great, and the scrolling weather, news and other functions work well.The issues.1. There is no way to have a larger clock in ""standard"" mode.  It's a small little clock in the corner, and even if you turn off all the info scrolling options like news, weather, etc. It stays this small little clock with a bunch of empty screen space. Do not disturb allows for a larger clock, but is a poor implementation of allowing it as it literally shuts everything else off.2. Do not disturb in the menu says it turns the screen off, but actually leaves the screen on and just gives you a larger clock.  It should turn the screen off as stated and there should be a separate mode for displaying a larger clock.3. Night mode is still WAY too bright and there's no way to adjust it or dim it down. Nor any option to configure it so that night mode is just a clock, no picture.Now, if this was a first try, these things would be forgivable as they worked through what the end user wanted.  The issue?  The Google Home Hub has been out for over a year and literally has NONE of these issues as they got all of these wrongs right.  Want a full screen clock.  Check.  Want a proper dnd mode? Check. A night time mode that properly dims the display?  Check.The fact that the Show 8 misses badly on all of these is just not acceptable.",0

",4.Jan.20,Yes,"This was a good upgrade from the Echo.  Good quality, sound, functionality.  Very easy to set up and use.

4,"Quite an Upgrade Over the ECHO
  
",4.Jan.20,Yes,"We have been using an ECHO unit for about 3 years and have been very happy with it. With the recent version 2 upgrade to the ECHO Show, and with the recent addition of grandchildren living 8 hours away, we decided to try the Show 8 out.The unit installation was a super simple plug-an-play using the Alexa app. Amazon has certainly made the start up for their products super simple. We moved the ECHO to the master bedroom, and the ECHO Dot to a different location.After 2 weeks we are VERY happy with it. We are able to do visual phone calls with our son and family (they upgraded to a Show 8, also). We have  added the Recipe Speak skill, uploaded a lot of our recipes, and like the visual functionality. We use Our Groceries (we love it) and can now get a visual on what is on the list(s). There are other things we are trying as we learn what can be done.The sounds seems to be very good, also. The better sound may be a function of the unit sitting in a corner up against two walls.Why 4 versus 5 stars?  The ECHO Show 8's bottom is set so that the screen tilts backward slightly; there is no way to adjust this tilt. Because of the location of our unit we either have to stand up to look straight into the screen for a phone call or prop the back up with a small block so we can sit down. Adjustable stands are available, and we will order one, but I think that some type of tilt device, even a very simple one, should come with the unit.",0
3,"Very useful but needs improvement
  
",4.Jan.20,Yes,"Why is there not a way to control volume silently?  In the middle of a phone conversation, it is ridiculous to have to interrupt the conversation to say, ""Alexa, set the volume to five.""  A drop down volume menu is needed.  And how much would a smear/smudge resistant glass cost: another dollar?  The smudges are instant and precipitant.  If you use the Show 8 regularly, you will need to clean it two or three times a day.  If you happen to use a lotion, count on even more frequent cleaning.  The auto dim feature is a love=hate relationship.  It's good to dim the screen at midnight, in the dark but when it happens at 3:00 PM in a dim room, it is very annoying.  On the other hand, the speakers are excellent for this type of devise.  The screen resolution is adequate for viewing almost anything.  It's not HDR,4K but it is a very watchable view.  These changes don't require a complete redesign of the Show 8, just some tweaks to let it live better in anyone's lifestyle.",0
5,"Worth it.
  
",5.Jan.20,Yes,"A lot more fun than the dot. Screen rolls with interesting tidbits from current news to music suggestions to recipes to just about anything. You can play your photos , watch prime etc. Had the dot toothed to a Bose speaker but no need with the show. The sound quality is excellent. Even great bass response. Bigger is always better but can figure out why the 10 is so much higher the n the 8$.",0

If I need a recipe, I ask Alexa to get me a recipe, and then I have it on the screen there on my counter. I can not only hear, but see the weather report,watch video's. I add my shopping list to my phone, by telling Alexa to add items to my shopping list. The list is endless,as to what I can do!",0

",5.Jan.20,Yes,I was extremely impressed with the sound quality when playing music!,0
3,"Pretty Cool, it's the same old Alexa with a screen.
  
",5.Jan.20,Yes,"I wasn't really expecting to be blown away by this item, and I'm really not. It does give you that futuristic feeling like your in the movie Aliens and Sigourney Weaver is calling you, getting you out of a sound sleep to make sure you're not bringing them back to study!! ha. First thing that came to mind when I used the Camera. Which is a nice feature, though 1MP, that's a little strange. Though it's pretty clear. But a little ""invasive"" with the drop in feature, which can be adjusted. The screen is VERY touch sensitive, which is good if you use it, and that's actually, rarely. Since the voice recognition is excellent.I find myself mostly using my voice most, since that's really what it's designed for. Alexa is integrated MUCH better and she it super responsive, compared to the old models. Almost overly so. The screen isn't really that bright which is good, and it's not a strain on the eyes. However I don't picture myself watching much on Amazon Prime Video on this device. For that it's really for the ""Kitchen"" area for people who spend time in their cooking, eating, or sitting working on something at the table. Then i can picture it being like a small TV in the background like from the 80's, when people use to keep up on their Soap Operas.My biggest disappointment overall it the sound, louder isn't always ""better"". The lack of high end just really doesn't cut it for me when I'm listening to music on it. It seems to have good panning, but the bass (on this model) is just to overwhelming in my opinion. Even when Alexa speaks it's very very low end, even boomy. But for the price, it's a very cool gadget. The wireless works perfect, and the range is incredible. Probably the best I've seen on anything, no interruptions, pausing, stuttering, or anything like that. So if you're in the market for a ""New Alexa"" this one is the right price, and I definitely recommend it over the others. Even next to your bed you may want to watch a short episode of your favorite sitcom or something. But whole movies? Not so much. So I like it, and it's very innovative. I see why they don't stay on the shelves in stores. A solid 3.5......btw AMAZON this is YOUR product, can you let us reviewers have ""half"" a star for pity sake? ha....ENJOY!!!",0

",5.Jan.20,Yes,"I_e wanted to try an Echo Show &amp; this was on sale for Christmas. It came with a free Echo Dot. It was easy to setup &amp; add to the other Echo products I already have &amp; link to my SmartThings Hub.

",5.Jan.20,Yes,It_ lovely,0
4,"Improved sound, improved form factor, poor backwards integration. Some setbacks with setup
  
",5.Jan.20,Yes,"Overall, a nice device to integrate into our home setup (more than 2-dozen smart devices, in an IoT integrated home).We've had the first generation of Show devices since they came out and I was excited to see the upgrades. Hands down, the sound quality is greatly improved! Nice improvements to the deeper bass sounds, although I could argue to almost to the point that the highs drop out.Mostly, I was disappointed that my app didn't allow me to add this to our home and that the device doesn't allow some of the new features (like stereo pairing) with older devices. This seems lazy to me.I didn't like that I had to enter the passwords of our account into the device multiple times to set it up.Overall, if I don't have to change configurations too many times, I think I'll like this. But if it is as much of a hassle to change wifi passwords requiring multiple accounts, I'll probably ditch the whole Alexa line-up.",0

5,"Sounds amazing, wish it would listen as good.
  
",5.Jan.20,Yes,"Screen is great, sound is amazing, but the voice recognition is terrible (echo line wide) we replaced a dot with this echo 8 thinking the mic in our dot was going bad. Apparently it is just an echo thing in general now? Our first echo seemed too sensitive, anything remotely close to ""alexa"" would trigger it, then it started not picking up until I yell at it. The new one, along with our other 4 echos, all seem to have hearing issues. Maybe a firmware thing?",1
5,"Works great
  
",5.Jan.20,Yes,So far we love it. My daughter loves the amazon music wit lyrics,0
2,"As usual, Amazon's lack of UX design is the low point of this device
  
",5.Jan.20,Yes,"The show is occasionally helpful, and once I managed to get my own photos as a background, enjoyable to see. However, 1) that's very hard to do and 2) It WILL NOT allow you to stop the continuous onslaught of ""Try... blah blah"" at the bottom of the screen.  I hate seeing those and I hate that their appearance (a movement) attracts my attention from whatever else I was doing. Similarly, the screen cycles through formats and photos pretty quickly and abruptly, again using motion to capture my attention. Really, I just want an attractive photo frame with the time, weather, and calendar events that responds when I talk to it.",0
2,"Touch screen is insensitive on inactive home screen, clock is always displays at the left corner
  
",5.Jan.20,Yes,"These reviews about how to disable ""Try Alexa"" reminder and making clock display larger and at the center, are misleading. I tried all kinds of setting combinations, the reminder still show up from time to time, the clock is always displayed at the upper left corner of the screen. However, there is a workaround === [enable the screen magnifier!]Another problem, the touch screen is very insensitive.  Overall, this product is very unsatisfying.  But I am keeping it for sake of Echo features (NOT the show features) and hoping the future  firmware upgrade can fix  all these annoying defects.",0
5,"This is an amazing product
  
",5.Jan.20,Yes,This 8 inch Echo is absolutely amazing I previously had the 5 inch and I must say this one is far and away 10 times better due to its size don_ waste your time getting the smaller one just go for the big boy.,1
4,"Great echo device
  
",5.Jan.20,Yes,This is how the echo show 5 should have featured. I was slightly disappointed with the show 5's inability to hear me correctly and it's slow reaction to touch. I have little issues with this and Alexa hearing me. It's quick and works usually to what I say. Sound quality is great and of course better than the 5. Screen is quite big as expected so I use this in the living room and I can see it from across the room.  I wish I could adjust the font size;  it needs to be just slightly bigger with the bigger screen.,0

5,"Echo Show 8 is GREAT!
  
",5.Jan.20,Yes,"This is our second show, the first being a Show 2.  Hands down the sound and video quality are far better.  It also beats all of our other dots and echos when we play whole house music.  Looking for an excuse to get another one. _",0

1,"Avoid
  
",5.Jan.20,Yes,"Very disappointed, it doesn't connect to ring service through the skill, so I can't watch the ring cameras that I have around the house. That was one of the main reasons why I bought it. I have contacted Amazon about the problem and I have talked with a service tech that acknowledge the problems but was not able to solve them. I was told that they would keep in touch with me but after the second unsuccessful phone call I haven't heard back....Maybe Amazon is just trying to avoid a returnAs far as other functions,  voice recognition is quite good. Sound is good for a device of that size.The screen looks good but the response to any touch action is very slow. It needs a faster processor, I would rather pay more for a device that works smoothly and without bugs.",1

",5.Jan.20,Yes,"Works great by itself as an Alexa device or as a tool integrated into a smart home with security cameras.With Ring you can see who is at the door and have a conversation without going to the door. With other security devices you have the ability to ""show"" the state or the video feed.I also think it's neat that you can show recipes while you are baking step by step. You can also pull up videos including YouTube. You can video chat. When you listen to Amazon music you can so lyrics when they are available and album art.For those nervous about the camera you can turn it off and it has a slide cover so you don't need to worry about it.All in all I'm pretty impressed with this device. I like it way more then I thought I would. They put a lot of thought into it. I recommend it if you utilize Amazon voice service.",0
4,"More capability than I know what to do with!
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,"8 inch display is clear and bright. To my mind the extra money to get the display over the plain echois well worth it. One of the nice things I like is that the display continously puts up hints of various commands. One time it told me to say ""Alexa, watch Jack Ryan"". Sure enough, just that easily I was watching Prime Video Jack Ryan. I had no idea I could do that!The speakers are very good, much better than I expected!  Surprisingly good bass. The unit is a lot heavier than one would expect, I am guessing because of big speaker magnets.The capability to listen and recognize commands from several feet away is better than I expected as well.I recommend this!",0
4,"I love the concept and convenience but she is annoying
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,As with most Alexa products she clearly does not understand what you are saying. I can't count how many times I am playing a game when you need to answer and you will give the correct answer and Alexa will say no and then repeat the same thing you just said.,0

4,"It's ok
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,"Good device. Had an issue with no soundbut it was easily corrected by unplugging and replugging the device. Also as far as knowledge, when asking her a question is still isn't as good as Google devices. I know that this device is still constantly developing but it still needs some work.there have been times when the home screen is on and it shows you different stories that go across the screen and then it prompts you to ask her the question and then it will say I don't know how to answer that. And I'm only reading exactly what it says on the screen but is unable to recognize the prompt. The original purchase this device as a secondary contact device between me and anyone who is at home when I'm away. For that reason it serves its purpose but can't wait for it any upcoming updates and improvements.",0
5,"Great for keeping in touch with family
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,"Great product. We use it to video call grandparents and family who live in other states. Great video quality. Wife sometimes has a hard time getting it to respond without telling.

I have about a dozen Echos and 9 Rings and the simplest thing is not possible to integrate... Sad Amazon...",0
3,"Can't figure out how to make calls to another echo
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,"I have multiple Alexa devices so I like this device simply b/c I use a lot of the features - lists, music, timers, etc.  However, I bought the show with the hopes of being able to make video calls to other Show owners.  But every time I try to make a call, it only calls the person's cell phone instead of their Show device.  I cannot figure out how to get it so that two people with shows can see each other ON THE SHOW.  The other thing that annoys me is that the design of the device means the camera is basically pointed at the ceiling.  You almost have to spend the extra money on the stand or else figure out a way to prop your device so you can actually see the person in front of the camera.",0
5,"Great Christmas present!
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,"I like being able to see the display from across the room.  Use it mainly for music, very good sound.  Also really like being able to edit shopping list on the display, instead of having to go to my phone or computer.  I've also loaded family pictures on it and enjoy seeing them change.",0
3,"If not for ads, this could have been a five star product
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,"I like the screen/display. Nice and vivid easy to look at, but also easy to see the never ending ""Try this with Alexa ad at the bottom. I find it ridiculous that Amazon has this on there without a way to get it off. Also ""Alexa is not so smart. Everyday I ask something and get a ""Huum, I dont know that. I am done with these stupid Alexa devices until Amazon gets the ads off, and these things can begin to answer more questions. For now all these Alexa enabled devices are more like eavesdropping machines more than a help. i.e...To this day I still cant get two or more Dot 3's to play music in a group.",0

",6.Jan.20,Yes,"I love my Echo Show 8.  The sound is EXCELLENT and mine is set at only 30.  I would like to make a suggestion though.  I love Lauren Daigle so when I ask Alexa to play her songs the words display on the screen.  I love this.  However when I set an alarm to music the word don_ display even when I request it.One more suggestion, I_ like the day of the week and the date to display on the home screen like on the Echo 5.  The Echo 8 doesn_ have this capability.Anyway the above can be added?Otherwise I highly recommend the Echo Show 8.",1
5,"ALEXA WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL MY LIFE
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,"I never thought of purchasing Alexa because of privacy concerns on the news regarding these types of home assistants. Our daughter gave us Alexa Echo Show 8 for Christmas and now we_e so happy to have it. Privacy concerns are simple to address following their instructions. It_ nice to have recipes, weather, music etc without having to use our iPhones for everything. Plus it connects easily to other smart home features. We love it &amp; wonder why we waited so long to connect!! I highly recommend this tech product.",0
1,"Disappointed, Doesn't Do What They Claim It Will Do
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,"I picked up a Show 8 recently. Liked it enough that I decided to get two for a paired stereo setup, a function which Amazon claims you can do with this device.  Unfortunately, I found it just doesn't work. If it has for others, would love to hear about it. Spent hours on my own troubleshooting. Then tonight spent an hour on the phone with Amazon tech support. That's a lot of time wasted only to find that there just doesn't seem to be any way to get two Show 8's working as a stereo pair. Since I have no idea if its a bug, or one or both units malfunctioning, I'll now have to return all of it, including 2 Dots that came with the Show 8's on a holiday sale/promotion. Very disappointing. Hope they work out the bugs and get it working as is promised. Seems like a device with a lot of potential, but for me it was just wasted time.EDIT:  After hours and hours of wasted troubleshooting an Amazon staff member got back to me on their device forum advising Amazon's info on their Compatible Echo Devices page was WRONG!  Wasted a ton of time, money, and now even more time for returns because of Amazon's misinformation about the stereo pairing for these!  Ask me how annoyed I am at this moment?? Nice of Amazon to apologize on their forum for my ""inconvenience"". Lot of good that does me!!!  P.S. While they've now corrected their compatibility for stereo pairing page they've left questions answered here that still contain the wrong information. I hope others don't go thru a problem because of that. Merry XMAS to you to Amazon :(",0
5,"Well worth the price.
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,"I purchased 8 Echo Show so I could see a larger screen for my Ring doorbell. It synced with no problems. The video screen is clean and crisp. I use it to play music, call my family and friends, and I can ask for all kinds of information and receive it so much faster than I can look it up. I loved it so much I also purchased the Dot for my bedroom.",0
5,"Neat gadget
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,I really like having this in my kitchen. I can watch prime video and use it just like my other Alexa electronics. The only thing that gets annoying is the try this captions that run along the bottom of the screen. I can't figure out how to turn that off.,0
3,"Let down!
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,I was excited for the echo show 8 and ordered as soon as it was released. After setting up and using for a few weeks I am overall disappointed as it feels more like a prototype than an 8th versionPros-Good voice recognition-Speakers are great-Works as a good clock-Works with RingCons-Overall choppy. Alexia can_ do a lot of things. Also freezes regularly and I have to unplug and plug back in-I wanted to use as a baby monitor with my foscam. I was only able to set up 2 of my 3 cameras for some reason as the 3rd camera wouldn_ discover. When I view  the camera it stays up for about 5 minutes then the screensaver comes on. It looks like there is no way to keep the display on so its basically useless for me-Doesn_ work smoothly with Nest as they are forcing me to migrate my nest account to google for it to work-Doesn_ integrate too well with Spotify.

",6.Jan.20,Yes,"It's (almost) all good doing the things that an Echo or a Dot can do, but some re-thinking needs to be done on what the display displays and how you set it up.  Its as though the designers pictured it only being used on a desk and not as an alarm clock  or, perhaps sitting under a television or other tythings that people could have thought to do with it.But it would be nice if there were a way to get rid of the ""Suggestions"" that keep turning up on the lower part of the display.It wold also be 100% better if you could make it act like a regular ol' digital clock and only chnge screens when you ask it to do something.  Unlike the the Show 5, you can't change clock faces so you are stuck with the clock face that is too small to read from across a room.  There is a larger clock face that would be OK if you could keep it on the display instead of it changing to the small one periodically  no matter what settings you change.Virtually all settings must be one on the display itself.  It would be useful to be able to change the settings from the Alexa App.",0

",6.Jan.20,Yes,Second Show for me. The Show 5 is on my desk and the Show 8 is in the kitchen and is easier to see when used for recipes and videos. I get my morning Flash Briefing now on this device and it has advantages over my Echo Plus. The main being a few of the segments have videos that are not able to be seen on the Echo Plus of course. I like the way the Show devices not only tell you the weather but give you a screen with a few hourly forecasts. The ability to see a short video on the recipe prep is also quite handy. I like to say Hi to friends in the morning while I am making breakfast and it is certainly better with video.,0

",6.Jan.20,Yes,"Sounds a little less full than the, well, full sized Echo but sounds a whole lot better than the Echo Spot it replaced.One quirk that is ANNOYING is if the physical camera button is activated, the unit disconnects from the ""everywhere"" group for my music.Other than that, it's great for my bedroom while its bigger cousin inhabits another larger room.",0

",6.Jan.20,Yes,The device is great. Sound quality is awesome. The only thing I must complain about is the brightness.

You can't darken the screen without telling her to turn off her screen. A real let down. Let's pray for some updates.",0
5,"One of the Best Purchases Ever!
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,"I LOVE my Echo Show 8! I received it along with a year's subscription to The Food Network Kitchen and it is an absolutely amazing combination for people who love to cook. Not only that but the sound is great, it makes a beautiful digital frame for your photos and I personally like all of the suggestions that you can program to pop up. Recipes, your local weather, news headlines of all kinds, etc. I find out all kinds of interesting things lol.I didn't buy the 5 because frankly, I wanted to make sure I would be able to see it without any issue at a slight distance and it's perfect for my kitchen. I did not buy a stand and don't see me needing one.I honestly have nothing negative to say about this product. As an owner of multiple Kindles and audio Echo's (1st Gen) I look at this as just another Home Run for Amazon and me!",0
5,"Alexa is smarter than I thought
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,I love this! I love that I can ask Alexa to snooze my alarm; I don_ even have to open my eyes! Lots of other great stuff as well!,0
4,"Great but needs some updates
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,"I wish you could customize the home screen more. To include the digital display of the clock. I want to have it bigger on the screen and I want to be able to dim it or make it brighter. My old alarm clock had a bigger display and I was able to dim the clock to a setting I preferred. Not so with Echo 8.Sound is excellent, and screen is great quality.Camera points to the sky, why? Awkward when doing video chat. I like the feature of sliding cover camera. Great feature.Having difficulty with Alexa in general when playing music on a speaker group. The only way I can make it work is to say, ""Alexa play music on -speaker group-"". I can't tell Alexa to play a particular genre or band on a speaker group. It just doesn't work.You Tube is NOT on Echo 8. It tells you to open it via internet browser ""Firefox"". Awkard when using YouTube that way. I can't type anything in search because there is NO KEYBOARD! How can I search for a video?I hope there will be more updates and improvements. Still a great item",0
4,"Echo show 8
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,"I've been satisfied so far, whisper recognition how cool is that, being considerate of others, big screen to show what you want to have alexa show, down fall, the screen does not sleep when in idle or no option, when you want the room dark, I regret not getting the adjustable stand, it would have come in handy, I'd recommend this product we are having fun with it, more to learn.",0

I am upset that I purchased this item with a Christmas promotion to get a free eco dot. Then when I received and opened box, no eco dot included. Customer service told me I didn_ check the box, which I did. So item is nice but I am upset Amazon did not keep their promo deal when I purchased this during their marketing campaign.",0
5,"8-inch screen is better than the 5-inch...and speakers are better too.
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,"Love this device. I can view my RING cameras on it, read recipes, set reminders, play music. Really functional and the screen is much better quality than the Echo Show 5 (the smaller version of this device). Go with this 8"" version because the speakers are much better than the 5"" version.",0
4,"Love, but has glitch!
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,"Love this, but it won't run my entire routine.  I contacted customer support, and they told me to unplug my device and restart it and to also disable my routine and re-enable it. I have unplugged and restarted my device twice, and I have completely deleted my routine and put a new one in to Alexa but to no avail.  I still can't get my routine to run completely on this Echo.  My other Echo devices run my routine just fine.  Other than that, I have no issues with the Show. I really love the ease of use, how easily I can access information, listen to music, stream, and communicate!",0

",7.Jan.20,Yes,"My sister &amp; I bought three (3) Echo Show8 as gifts for our mom (73) and her two sisters (75 &amp; 80) at Christmas. I must say have they been the hit!! Even my Uncle wants one of his own! They can be difficult to find just the right gift for. This year my sister &amp; I with Amazon_ help hit it out of the ballpark!Setup was simple and smooth. I placed all three units on my account, loaded up with lots of extended family pictures and access to Amazon Music. All three are enjoying talking with each other in a new way. They love seeing the many photos of other brothers, sisters, nieces, nephews and their kids. Since visiting in person is difficult due to age and distance the Echo Show 8 is warming their hearts. What I hear most of all is they absolutely love the music! I_ fact my uncle is tired of listening to Elvis  my aunt_ favorite Overall, I would recommend the Echo Show 8 for anyone that is looking for a nice size screen, easy to setup, simple to use and has TONS of options. Don_ forget the Alexa app. Very helpful for me to monitor the units as well.",0

",7.Jan.20,Yes,So helpful! Also really like the on/off privacy switch for the camera.,0

5,"We already bought more
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,"The screen is much larger than the Show 5, and the sound is FAR superior.  It connected in less than a minute &amp; connected to Ring and our home security cameras with ease.  My wife uses this for music, timer in the kitchen, recipes &amp; to monitor the baby.  We love it &amp; already bought more for other rooms",0
5,"Alexa Echo Show 8
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,"Was so easy to set up. Turn it on and it leads you through the set up. I have mine in my kitchen to help me with cooking. Very good quality screen time. Also, have my Ring doorbell hooked up to it, so I can see who is at the front door.",0
5,"Alexa integration so easy my Mother-In-Law could have done it!
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,"We live out beyond the suburbs in the rural hinterland with marginal internet connectivity. So we have chatted it up with the grandkids with Echo dots, thinking there was inadequate bandwidth for video. But Santa brought the Echo Show, so we gave it a go. Way to go! Literally, plug and play (no plug and pray required).  Very nice display with updated settings interfaces for personal configuration so all those negative reviews (mostly User Not as Smart as Smart Device (UNASSD)) appear to have been listened to and responded with this hardware / software release.Nice sound quality both for video chats and streaming audio. Nice shutter control to block the camera lens if paranoid or conspiracy theorist. Nice long (48"" maybe) power cable for flexibility in placement.  Camera appears to be positioned for counter top placement. We started on top of the microwave but the video chat only got the ceiling fan. Cleared a few inches of counter space and the camera angle covers us well.Negatives: can a review be only good things? Well, thinking hard, the two things we ""dislike"" are the plug end of the power cable takes up a bit of room at the outlet but we managed to squeeze it in; and the integrated camera / display / base unit is fixed - so you either need to be standing in the angle of view for the video chats, or tilt the Echo Show forward and place a pencil or ruler under the back edge to adjust the field of view.  It's not a problem when reading or surfing - only for the video chats.Bonus: I did not realize that the Echo Show would know about the Echo Dot we have upstairs. The first time the Grandkids called, the Dot reported ""call from the Bean"" so we knew to run downstairs and take the incoming video chat. Nice integration, nice online help that explains all the things you can try (or not).  Very pleased, even with some of the very bad ""Dad jokes.""",0
5,"Awesome Smart Home Control
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,We purchased this Echo Show 8 to incorporate our security system and other smart home products all in one place. We_e changing security platforms and the new one does not include a touch panel which we have become used to using. It sits in our living room. The speaker is pretty good definitely better than the initial echo and echo dots which we have in other rooms of the house. I like to listen to music on it often. It also works really well to Skype. Something I didn_ think I would use it frequently for. It_ nice for my son to be able to Skype with my parents without having to give him one of our phones. The screen is the perfect size.,0
5,"Priceless! Love it for every reason, HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,"WONDERFUL GIFT! Love having Alexa! We have different Alexa devices all over the house. Love playing our Audible books, playing games like Jeopardy, having her play relaxing/meditation or studying music, setting reminders/timers, grocery lists, alarms, being able to talk to my kids in different rooms. We use her to power our tv, our lights, our door lock, nest thermostat, garage door, ring doorbell, absolutely love having a smart home with her to help!! This is a great, reliable option. Great gift for kids too! Love the camera cover option! :)) My younger kids have all their questions answered, alarms and reminders to keep them on track, chore lists, I can drop in and talk to them, and they have finished 2 books on Audible JUST since Christmas with Alexa! Use this daily for recipes during dinner. Thanks Amazon!",0

",7.Jan.20,Yes,"you can't adjust camera angle unless you prop something under it, you have to stand up  just to see your face, the adjustable mount is another$30, horrible price for a piece of plastic that should be included!  device is excellent, just a rip off to make you buy and adjustable stand! will return for this reason and buy google home device! Amazon ruined this great device!",0
2,"Read the fine print before you decide to buy
  
",8.Jan.20,Yes,"Alexa can play music from your music collection.  Yes, but only if you bought the music from Amazon.  If your digital music collection contains music purchased elsewhere, Alexa won't play it.  Amazon says that's for security reasons.  So the policy is not to force you to buy all your music from Amazon.  (Apple does essentially the same thing with its devices.)Alexa can read your calendar, email and contacts.  Yes, but only if you pay extra to access your mailbox if is on a Microsoft Exchange server, which is the most common mail server in the world.  Amazon says that's because Exchange servers are used by business.  Yes, businesses do use Exchange mail servers.  But lot of private users like me also use mailboxes on Exchange servers.Amazon, like other companies that sell both hardware and services, appears to be moving toward a business model where the hardware it sells will be increasingly limited to exclude commercial activity with any firm that competes with Amazon.",0

5,"Fun addition
  
",9.Jan.20,Yes,Bought several of these at Christmas for me and my siblings. Setup was amazingly simple and was in a video chat with my sister within 10 minutes. There is a couple of things to be aware of. With this device you do not need another echo device in the same room. More than one and they get crossed on some commands. Be aware of what contacts you allow it to upload. Especially if you have your email and social accounts installed on your phone for it has issues with duplicate entries.,0
2,"Not that impressed.
  
",9.Jan.20,Yes,"Does not integrate with fire tv cube in same room well. Not the best at recognizing wake word. Have to use different command than cube. Ask for lyrics to a song, but only gives the first verse. Asked for song release date. Stated a  much later. The camera is angle so that if sitting at a table you have to place something under it to tilt camera down. Probably designed so you have to buy a expensive stand. Most of Alexa appearscto be getting dumber.",0
5,"Love my Echo Sho
  
",9.Jan.20,Yes,"Easy to set up, the more I use it the better it understands my commands.

3,"Bulky and glitchy
  
",9.Jan.20,Yes,"Have used this for few months now. Not sure if the item was returned or was new due to packaging. It wasn_ registered to anyone so I assume new. It is very glitchy - voice recognition makes mistakes routinely. We have to repeat many times. Once it takes you to what it thinks you said - you have to exit and repeat what you really want. That_ very annoying too. We like to play games on the device but also annoying when it asks every time if you want to sign up for a subscription on basically every game. We have the google comparable version - voice recognition, games, search is much better. They should Save the response from before and not ask again. It is bulky. Shaped like an old cathode ray tube tv. I guess much of it is the speaker/mic. Nice features being able to use as an intercom with other Alexa devices, play music. Connecting devices is ok with the app. Again google was easier and better. Switched to Alexa as we kept getting echo dots thrown in with purchases. I guess they caught us. The ask Alexa notices on the main screen - don_ bother so much. If you switch to do not disturb - it stops the notifications but then you can_ fully use the device. Hopefully future updates make things run smoother.",0

",9.Jan.20,Yes,I think it is fun,0
5,"Highly Recommended. Amazing!
  
",9.Jan.20,Yes,"I think just the Echo Dot 3rd generation is amazing! Then my mom bought me this wonderful Echo Show 8"". It does so much. You can see song lyrics. You can look up recipes. You get a video of the recipe. You can just scroll the screen for the ingredients or Alexa will read them to you. You can save the recipes in your favorites. The Echo Show 8"" is really amazing with the sturdy magnetic stand they sell for it. Echo Show 8"" even scrolls stuff across the screen giving you ideas you can try and not just for the Echo Show 8"" either. Now because of this item, I know so many more things I can do with my Echo Dot 3rd generation! The Show new everything about me. Integrated easily with my Dots. I learned you can ask Alexa who am I? Then if she doesn't know, she'll tell them who's Echo it is and ask you your name. Then when you tell her ,she'll ask if you want her to set up a voice profile you say yes. Then she will start calling you by your name. You can do that both on the Echo Show 8"" and the Echo Dot. Also with the Echo Show as long as you don't close your camera, you can call check in on kids pets etc and actually see them.",0
4,"Great addition to my smart home setup!
  
",9.Jan.20,Yes,Is way better than I expected. Sound quality was awesome and very clear.  Occasionally it has a mishap but I_e noticed the more I use it the better it gets .

4,"It does so much more than I will ever be able to use or even understand.
  
",9.Jan.20,Yes,"It's fun, helpful, responsive. I need some detailed instructions as to how to use it. I would also like to know how to stop it from snooping. Sometimes I walk in the room  when there is no on there but and me and she is  ""listening.""  It doesn't concern me because there is nothing going on that I need to hide.  But it is disconcerting to know that someone ""out there"" is listening. It can sure feed one's paranoia.",0

3,"Excellent hw, mediocre touch sw, no Group Chat or Youtube app
  
",9.Jan.20,Yes,"The hardware sounds excellent and the video chat quality is very good.However, there is no Group calling unless Portal or Nest, and also there is no support for Youtube or Youtube TV. You must be a Hulu person. It is missing a lot of video streaming apps.Apple Music support is mediocre. The idea of Skills is like 2nd-rate Apps. I would must rather they called Skills-&gt;Apps and allowed developers to create a more intuitive experience.The main problem is that you have to memorize so many commands and Alexa doesn't help you out with her touch screen.Overall, I've bought a lot of these for family members bc they do serve some valuable purposes. These include: 1:1 video chat, Amazon Music + Lyrics, ""Named Timers"" (why aren't there named alarms?), and a Photo Frame.  Otherwise, it's kind of a novelty currently.",0
3,"I need a lot of help with this
  
",9.Jan.20,Yes,"The Show was a Christmas gift.  My son set things up.  However, it uploaded ALL of my photos from my camera.  Do I want a picture of my car battery on the Show?  No.  How about medically sensitive photos, which I have a lot of.  I can't even run the slide show for fear of what will be shown.  I deleted the Amazon photos app from my iPhone, but apparently it's too late, all those unwanted pictures are there, somewhere.  I need MORE CONTROL over this device.  It should only display photos I want displayed, not act as a vacuum to all my photos.  I'm not sure what to do next.",0

3,"Very Good Device, but still has Flaws..
  
",10.Jan.20,Yes,"First off, Kudos to amazon for doing right by me when my discontinued Echo spot started acting up.  They gave me the full purchase price as a credit toward the Show 8.  Ended up only costing me $5 with the $99 sale price.So now to the review.  It should be noted that I have a Show 5 as well, so I will make a couple of references when going over features and function.  To start, as HUGE plus is the ability to physically disable the camera.  This is something that the show 5 had but the Echo Spot didn't.  Its nice having the peace of mind not having to worry about anyone's privacy, no matter what room the device is in.The Screen is HUGE, bright and clear.  Its nice not having to watch distorted videos on a round screen.  Its a great price point between the show 5 and the original Echo Show.  The camera is the same as the Show 5 @ 1mp, more then enough for video chat.  It looks clear, with now distortions. This of course will depend on your internet/WiFi connectivity. The sound quality is very good.  Its not a $2k audio system, but its not a cheep pair of headphones ether...  The sound is rich and full and quite enjoyable.  Functionally its like any other Alexa device.Now for the issues.  The two big ones, and the reason for knocking off the 2 stars, is first, the LIMITED availability of clock face customization.  If you go to settings and select clock &amp; faces, all you can pick is the clock background.  The HUGE face, and the time is limited to being displayed in one corner.  The Show 5 had all kinds of face options, but this one only lets you pick the backgrounds.  Yes you can have a photo or something from Facebook, a couple of ugly pictures and a single semi solid background, but that's it.  You should at the very least be able to have the time take up most of the screen to be able to see it at night or from across the room.  The show 5 has customization, why is it not part of the Show 8 as wellThe other one is an annoyance with every screen based Alexa device I have ever owned.  YOU CAN NOT DISABLE THE ""THINGS TO TRY"" TEXT.  Its in the middle of, or on the bottom of almost EVERY card that the device displays.  You can turn off everything else, but not that....  I want to have it rotate between time &amp; weather...  THAT'S ALL.  If I need to find new things to try I will look it up myself....  This has annoyed me and A LOT of other people for a very long time.  Come on Amazon, lets have a way to turn this off.Overall I am happy, and hopeful that Amazon will listen and get us some updates real soon...  I'll update this if anything else happens.",0
5,"Perfect!! Thank you!!
  
",10.Jan.20,Yes,"For $80, this thing is insane!! I use it for my alarm clock that is amazing and has a TON of customization! I love how I can view my RING cameras and my WYZE camera from it as well. The sound quality is also awesome for such a small unit. Thank you!",0
5,"Great product Echo Show 8
  
",10.Jan.20,Yes,"Great for checking who's at the door without having to get cell phone,  music , weather,  news",0
4,"very pleased
  
",10.Jan.20,Yes,"I am very happy with this Echo 8, but I didn't give it a full 5 star rating because I have found it hard to set up a few things.  We really purchased so we could do 4 way video chats with parents and 3 kids, we can't figure it out and haven't been able to find answers yet on how to do it.  I would like to see a feature similar to skype that you can add a persons name - only to this alexa device and call them.  I want to call my son on it, but only for him to answer when he is at home.  I call him now and it rings on alexa and his iphone - which then I am interrupting him.  I guess maybe its better resources to use for those technically challenged",0
5,"Love it so far!
  
",10.Jan.20,Yes,"I bought this for my mom and I at Christmas, so we could have the joy of spending time together, cooking and working out even when there_ distance between us!  We have Only had it For a few weeks but so far I love it!!!  I_ curious if I can also use it as a electronic photo frame to look at my pictures, but haven_ look into that yet.  Either way it was much worth it!I also purchased a screen protector which I think is kinda crap but it does the job for now, but I do also recommend the more expensive stand that allows you to move the screen in all directions.  It_ magnetic and very sturdy which is perfect if using it in the kitchen, you definitely want something to hold it so you don_ have to worry about spills.  Like I said so far very excited about this product but still learning all the functions",0
5,"Easy access to information!
  
",10.Jan.20,Yes,I do love the easy access to information. Alexa has a very soothing voice - not digital :o) and the suggestions for topics of interest makes it easy to stay current! Great gift!,0
5,"So many uses
  
",10.Jan.20,Yes,"I feel like I am barely scratching the surface of what Alexa can do. I listen to music all the time. I get news and weather updates. Alexa suggests all sorts of things she can do such as provide recipes, tell jokes, answer questions, etc. The sound quality is wonderful. This is my second device and I love it!",0
5,"Gift giving
  
",10.Jan.20,Yes,I gave it as a gift,0
4,"I like it
  
",10.Jan.20,Yes,"I have plenty of ""devices"", got this as a present.  Sound quality and volume are great, over my Echo Plus.  Don't consider this a ""hub"", it isn't. Still using my Echo Plus as the connection.  Sound quality is really great - avoiding the word ""amazing"", but it out does the Echo Plus.",0
5,"Ease of set up surprised me. It just logged in by itself
  
",10.Jan.20,Yes,"I have so many devices now, but this is quite special. Love it",0
5,"Echo show 8
  
",10.Jan.20,Yes,I like the look of it. Video calling works great.... would buy another.,0
5,"Amazing
  
",10.Jan.20,Yes,I love it! The video quality is amazing and it pairs easily with other smart devices.,0
5,"FABULOUS
  
",10.Jan.20,Yes,"I LOVE my Alexas &amp; Echo. Yes, I now have three so beware, they are addictive. We live at the bottom of a large hill &amp; get terrible reception on all the radios I_e ever tried. I can get my radio stations on Alexa/Echo &amp; the sound is beautiful, especially on Echo Show 8. My grandson stopped over &amp; set up Alexa to turn on our bedroom light. More new toys/securities!",0
5,"My Kitchen Companion
  
",10.Jan.20,Yes,"I ordered this during one of the Christmas Lightning Deals. I got it for myself because I love to cook and bake. I would use my iPhone or Mac in the kitchen and found it inconvenient.So, when I saw the deal, which by the way, also came with a free Echo Dot I snatched it up. Sound quality is excellent. Especially love the sound of the bass.  Color and picture display is so clear, crisp and vibrant.",0
5,"Echo 8
  
",10.Jan.20,Yes,I really liked how when the song plays it also shows the lyrics. Can sing along and know the true words to song. Really fun. Also when a package is delivered to your home the echo will tell u. Really a great feature.,0
4,"Where r explicit directions found?
  
",10.Jan.20,Yes,"I wish there were more Clear directions easily found on - well, anywhere! Basic setup was easy, but _ine tuning has been frustrating. 1st challenge has been learning to use the _ap. Frustrated with repeated instructions to repeat, with no direction other than _ap.",0
3,"Don't  think I'm using device capability.
  
",10.Jan.20,Yes,Instructions with device non existing. Downloaded manual via Kindle not that much help.  Want to be able to sync other devices but haven't figured it out yet.  Need better help!!! Device is one of 4 Echos in the house.  Not as good as Siri. Maybe it will get better.,0
4,"Great picture quality and good sound.
  
",10.Jan.20,Yes,"It's a great addition to the Echo line.  I love watching my stored pictures pop up throughout the day.  I would appreciate some control over the frequency of the picture changes.  The settings are easy to change but slow to act.  All in all, I'm pleased with the purchase.",0
4,"Old lady
  
",10.Jan.20,Yes,It's kind of hard for someone older to try and figure it out. There was no instructions included in box at all. Would help a lot for someone not tech savvy.,0
5,"Better than echo dot.
  
",10.Jan.20,Yes,Love this echo show.,0
4,"Mostly great
  
",10.Jan.20,Yes,"Mostly very satisfied with this alexa device.  We bought it primarily for the slideshow feature to replace an old digital photo frame in our kitchen.  The Show 8 that we bought looks good and is the right size, but I'll be damned if I can figure out how to change the speed at which the pictures change in the slideshow.  I've searched hi and lo, and while there are instructions for doing this, they do not match the preferences/options in our device.  So, the pics change really, really slowly.  Hoping this gets fixed in a firmware update or something.",0
5,"Alexa sometimes mishears me
  
",10.Jan.20,Yes,Sometimes it doesn_ hear me correctly but very rare most of the time it put the correct thing or search_ the correct thing it_ worth the money,0
5,"sounds great
  
",10.Jan.20,Yes,Sounds great,0
5,"Bargain!
  
",10.Jan.20,Yes,Thanks for making a great product,0
5,"The echo show 8 is amazing!
  
",10.Jan.20,Yes,The echo show 8 is amazing!,0
5,"This is a nice addition to the basic dot
  
",10.Jan.20,Yes,"This adds streaming which is nice.  Integrates with Ring and Simplisafe.  Adds words to songs so it is a defacto karoke machine.I'm still exploring it, but I like it and it is worth the price, especially if you can get it on sale.",0
4,"Fun tech
  
",10.Jan.20,Yes,"This is my first time with a tech product like this. I just got it for Christmas, and I am not currently using it to it's full capabilities (video call, smart home) and still playing around with it.  It does have some really cool features and can do way more than I expected. Sound quality is great for playing music. Setup was super easy.  But sometimes I feel that if asking a question I could get a better/faster answer if I googled it on my phone. I considered getting this for my older parents but decided it was too complicated for them and would cause a lot of headaches.",0
3,"Good product, needs work on the voice, word and phrase recognition. Speaker and screen very good.
  
",10.Jan.20,Yes,Voice/word recognition is really bad.  I had a shoe prior and never had problems.  Maybe mine is broken and needs repair.,0
5,"Nice Upgrade From The Dots
  
",10.Jan.20,Yes,We had Ecco Dots all over the house.  This is a definite sound upgrade. And the screen is very useful in the kitchen for cooking. We bought one for the office as well.  Great to have the screen for spelling and visual (analog) transfer of info when I don't want to close the browser on the computer.  The price will come down.  But it's a value anyway.,0
5,"Echo Show exceeds expectations
  
",10.Jan.20,Yes,"We weren_ sure about having an Echo Show in  our house, but we love being able to have extensive visits with our kids who live in California.  And the quality of the music is just terrific.  So we decided to get an Echo for other parts of the house.  Get one!",0
5,"Amazung
  
",10.Jan.20,Yes,"Works really well. Owned a Google home prior, but the Alexa integration and communicating between Alexa devices is too useful to pass up. The screen Is very bright and clear and is very pleasing on the eyes.",0
5,"Sounds great
  
",10.Jan.20,Yes,"Yes, I can listen to my iPod Touch using Bluetooth so that makes me happy.  The Alexa tips at the bottom are annoying.  I changed settings and unplugged it.  That worked for a while but then the suggestions returned.  I need to buy some smart plugs.  I had trouble getting it to recognize my voice using the app on my phone but it worked using the device.  The sound quality is excellent.",0
5,"My life is easier now
  
",11.Jan.20,Yes,"I love the echo showMy grandson and I talk and see each other now _ the sound is great, I have 4 echos they have spoiled me I really feel like I have a assistant.",0
3,"Alexia with a tiny unchangeable clock!
  
",11.Jan.20,Yes,I really did not need a photo display device. Or another dot. I needed an integrated device with a large clock face so I can see the time when my glasses are off at night. A .75 inch clock -really Amazon? Do you think this product will succeed without a basic proper clock? Google has implemented their product 100 percent better. Please update the clock functionality to assist your visually challenged customers-PLEASE!,0
