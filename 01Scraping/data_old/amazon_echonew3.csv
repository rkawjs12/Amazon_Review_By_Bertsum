5,"Great Value!!!
  
",18.Oct.19,Yes,"I_e been waiting for the next generation for some time. I got one of these for when I_ in my hot tub and is perfect to sit on the patio and have great sound. Easy setup, great response time, the sound is fantastic!",83

5,"The Pros, Cons and Oks for the Echo 3rd Gen (HR).
  
",18.Oct.19,No,"Pros: This is a solid built machine. Very sturdy and no dust cracks, while retaining its simple form. One of the few times I can say you_e getting exactly what every picture on the web is showing. I had the basic black design, but I do appreciate that Amazon is offering more colors rather than there basic set (even if it_ only a few generic colors). The mute option is the most appreciative tool. When you activate it the classic blue glow will fall into the red, giving you the visual display that your privacy is being protected. The sound performs exactly what it_ built for. I found no issue in testing in an open living room. The volume goes to great levels as once again, for a 360-degree smart speaker, Amazon reigns supreme. Testing all ranges of music, I found that that bass to be rich and powerful. My colleague has the previous Echo Plus and she states that there is an improvement in the bass with this Echo. An overall rich sound when a piano came in and a warmer outcome when acoustics came into play (You_l get the bass experience when you hit those hard beats). Like any other model, the Bluetooth connectivity between a third party stereo works flawlessly. I tested this out with some Bose surround sound, and nothing but clear music. You can also pair the Echo if you have smaller / weaker speakers. Both together will pump up the experience. The connectivity is so flawless that buying two of these devices (or use Echo_ previous versions, if you have one) and put them in separate locations doesn_ make this a bad idea. You_e going to get great quality in music without paying an am or a leg for it. I have to appreciate Amazon for not pushing their music platform. They offer the usual Spotify (which I used) but also Apple Music, Deezer, TuneIn, even BBC sounds. You_e getting a lot more features than just a basic smart speaker. Using Google Home for over a year I can say that just saying _lexa felt more natural than saying _k Google. Not to mention having Alexa listen to me every time I said: _lexa (Google Home users will understand this). Like before, smart applications fit like a glove in this system. I only used it for lights and the Echo was spot on. This feature is more common than ever on any smart speaker, and the Echo does what it_ supposed to do. I admire the organization of the app because it_ your remote control on anything you want the Echo to do. Turn off lights, switch music, mute volume, install new features, and so forth. We all carry our phones like carrying our driver licenses when going outside. This day in age I_l always prefer an app than a physical remote. I did some Alexa calls on this and found only clear responses and answers (this will depend on your Wi-Fi). I would give 70% of Alexa sounding more human. Everything is in the cloud so, you don_ need to worry about manual updates. All taken care of. As I mentioned before, everything else is the same in a smart speaker. Ask for the weather, traffic, upcoming appointments, and all other general questions. I didn_ test all of them because_ell is the same technology as last year. The biggest difference in my book is the price. Newer and cheaper.Cons and Oks: No Zigbee controller. This isn_ much of an issue, but if you already have a smart house layout than you_l need to spend some extra time configuring with the Echo. The issue for this is that it puts more work on the Echo than you need. Also, there may be some smart devices that won_ work on the Echo because of this. I know last year's models had some connectivity issues with Philips Hue bulbs. Keep an eye out for which smart devices are compatible with the Echo. I did notice that the app slows down when you put a lot of apps and smart applications in the Echos. I tested a lot of features out that require a decent amount of downloads, but the results did create a delay in the app. I have to assume without Zigbee_ software, if you have a lot of smart applications connected to the Echo, and with the general apps you use, there will be a delay in the long run. The Echo gets loud. Loud enough that you_l get some distortion when you_e around 95% in volume. The effect is shown when a lot of bass is begin made. Please note that 90% and up is booming your entire house. Compare to Google Home, Alexa still isn_ the brightest smart speak in the family. For the basic day to day task it works fine, but those random questions that we tend to have throughout the day Alexa doesn_ deliver. Alexa will usually provide you with a quick one-sentence summary (Unlike Google, it would provide you a short paragraph.). This issue doesn_ happen all the time, but you_l notice it when it does. I_ trying to learn Spanish, so asking smile Spanish questions with Alexa is not reliable. Example I will say _lexa, what does _u칠 est치s haciendo in Spanish mean (What are you doing?)? Alexa will say _hat are you happy. I_e been studying for 6 moths so my speech on that sentence was spot on, but Alexa. Not a reliable study buddy. I had the first version of the Echo and all I can say is I miss the rotation ring. Bring it back Amazon. The design is nothing new. It_ built very solid, but it_ identical to Echo Plus 2. My colleague had the Echo Plus and putting them aside there was no way you can tell the difference (a nice note if you want to steal your friends and replace it with the last version). Even the sound is almost similar to the previous Echo. Both are fantastic, but almost the same.Bottom Line:It_ a great smart speaker system, but almost identical in every way as its previous model. There is nothing wrong with that because Amazon does put in a lot of features into this Echo that makes this right in the top three (Google Home, HomePods, and the Echo Family). It_ accurate, excellent sound, and lower in price than its previous model.Some concerns are the effects in the long run with those who have a decent amount of smart applications, and making sure the compatibility can be performed accurately. Also knowing the limits of what Alexa can and can_ do as the hardware is identical to its previous version. I wouldn_ be surprised if you want to just read Echo_ previous model amazon reviews. Trust me when I say that they_e almost identical in sight and performance.In the end, the reason it doesn_ matter about the flaws is because the price is well worth what you_e getting. It_ a machine that I can see using it every day for the simplest things such as setting up an alarm to enjoying it in small parties. I will say that if you_e planning to use your surround sound stereo connected to this, then this is a must buy. You pay a heavy price for a HomePod, enjoy a generic performance for a Google Home, and are presented with an overall user-friendly experience with the Echo 3. Cheaper than its predecessor and the worth every penny.Overall: A tiny upgrade from its previous model, but still an excellent experience in sound for all.Hope I was a help to you.Love,Honest Reviewer","1,255"
5,"Another great ECHO!!
  
",18.Oct.19,Yes,"Set-up took all of 30 seconds.Great,customizable sound. Good bass for rock;good overall sound for classical. Looks nice,too!I hope that,in the near future,I can pair my  DOT,3rd gen for even more immersive sound.Overall,very pleased!!!",14

5,"Overall really nice product with good sound quality.
  
",19.Oct.19,Yes,"I mainly use this Alexa as a speaker for my music. The sound quality on this Alexa is better than on the previous Alexa in my opinion. It's super easy to set up and use. I often change the location of my Alexa as well because as I said I mainly use it as a speaker.  It does really well if you need to unplug it and and plug it in in another location (as in it'll connect to the wifi on it's own and you can use it as you normally would without any hassle). I got the charcoal color and it's very nice visually. The Alexa app is also very convenient to use with it. You can personalize the sound of the bass and other mixes too. Overall, I say it's a really nice product. The packaging was super nice and felt high quality as well. No problems with shipping too.",8
5,"Worth the upgrade from Gen 1
  
",19.Oct.19,Yes,"Much better sound.  It's smaller by a bit too.  Easy set up.  Love it.  I bought 2 but might get a third. The sound improvement warrants that.  Also, the ability to sync all 3 to play the same tunes simultaneously.",3

5,"Amazon Echo Does It Again!
  
",20.Oct.19,Yes,"I suppose most people are wondering the obvious? Does it have any new features? Does it go well with your decor? Can you order a pizza and in fact, have Alexa pay for it? OK, that one I haven't tried yet... but I will tell you that it is an upgrade, looks sleeker than older versions, and the sound packs a  punch!Some services like apple music are atrocious! The service doesn't stay connected, and it's hardly useable. I venture to guess that this issue is fixable but this far is a letdown.If you're looking for a smart assistant that is extremely useful and always works... look no further! You won't regret it!",11
5,"Love it
  
",20.Oct.19,Yes,Received my echo about 2 days ago. Amazon was very good to help me set it up. So far I love it. I would definitely recommend it.Love my new echo Alexia. The sound is so plain. I love listening to music. Would highly recommend it.,0

5,"Bittersweet Upgrade
  
",21.Oct.19,Yes,"I purchased my first Alexa Echo 1st Gen two years ago and I fell in love right away! It was bittersweet for me to replace it with the newer 3rd Gen but they had an amazing trade-in offer so I had to take advantage of it. First thing to note this Echo is much shorter than Gen 1 but a little wider which I prefer because it looks and fits better on my kitchen island. The new blue color is amazing if you_e considering getting it! Setting up the new Echo was the easiest most seamless process! I literally took it out of the box, plugged it in and in under a minute it set itself up and was ready to use! I didn_ have to do anything, it was already programmed with my smart lights and my WiFi, couldn_ ask for an easier setup. I love my Echo and use it every day and if you_e considering getting one, I say go for it! If I had to critique or complain about anything the only thing I could say is the wall adapter is really large since it_ still a square block like Gen 1.  This is more of a personal opinion but Gen 1 had a rotating top to turn the volume up and down (which I loved) where as Gen 3 has volume up and down buttons. Functionally they both work I just though the rotating volume top was more fun and unique, but I_l live on just fine with the buttons.",240

",22.Oct.19,Yes,The new Echo has a much deeper and richer sound than the original Echo.  It was very easy to connect with my WiFi  We switched from black to twilight Blue and prefer the new look.  Very happy.  What I would like to see is for the App to be more user friendly and intuitive.,0

1,"Wake me when we get there
  
",25.Oct.19,Yes,"I bought an Echo and an Echo Dot. What a waste of money. They're basic; real basic. My fault for not truly understanding what I was buying. It can answer some simple questions with simple answers and do a few smart home things and has ""skills"" but that's about it. Isn't that enough? No, it isn't. I guess I thought I was getting something smart, something I could engage with, seek intelligent replies from, something connected to the world wide web of knowledge. Guess I was wrong. I got a stupid little automated squawk box; a borderline parrot. Guess I got bought. For all our great advances in technology, we're clearly still in our technological infancy. Get back to me when I can say ""Computer, describe to me quantum physics in layman's terms. Explain to me the theory of relativity. What exactly is gravity; are there gravity particles? What is the meaning of life?"" The answer to the latter better be: 42. Another big gripe is that it's constantly trying to sell me something -running through a whole dales pitch -instead of just doing or playing what I asked, or it tells me what it's about to do even though I just asked it exactly that. Now I know why it's called, Echo. I'll be getting rid of it soon. Anybody wanna buy a stupid, smart device?",161

",25.Oct.19,Yes,"Loving the new Echo! I ordered it in Twilight Blue and it looks awesome on my bed side table. The audio is amazing, crystal clear sound with lots of base.

4,"Alexa, we love you.
  
",26.Oct.19,Yes,Alexa is a great device. We use her to listen to music and podcasts which the speaker and 3 woofer is amazing for. We also use her for traffic updates and to set alarms.

5,"Well worth the investment
  
",26.Oct.19,Yes,"This is by far, the best Echo / system we have owned from Amazon.We purchased 2 of the generation 3 Echos and an Amazon sub as a package (saved $80 + an additional $60 for taking the Amazon store card) to replace the Bose speaker / Echo Dot we had.We now have room filling sound as good as the Bose combo without having to physically turn on the speaker every time we wanted music.Even without the sub, the sound is robust and rich from each of the linked speakers.  The addition of the powered Echo sub fills in the lows to make it an immersive experience.Setup was fairly easy.  My only complaint was that I had trouble renaming the 2nd Echo itself.  Amazon keeps calling it another wacky name.  Overall, it took less than 5 minutes to link all 3 speakers together and be listening.Would I purchase again?  You can count on it.",120

",30.Oct.19,Yes,"The sound on the Echo 3rd Gen is amazing!  We upgraded from the 1st Gen and you can clearly hear a deeper base and sound that fills the room.  We liked the different colors and twilight blue didn't disappoint.  The speaker is shorter and wider than the 1st Gen but that is a welcome change.  From a functionality standpoint, I don't see any difference from earlier gen echo devices as they can all answer questions, set timers, update lists, play music or trivia and turn on and off smart devices if you already had a hub such as Philips or Smart Things.  The 3rd Gen does not have its own hub but that was fine for us.

5,"Fabulous product
  
",5.Nov.19,Yes,This is an amazing product the power on this speaker is unbelievable! It works well with my Amazon music and I_ sure it will work well with all the other apps that it offers. I specially love the special functions where you can put in a sentence and ask Alexa a specific response LOL it_ quite enjoyable. She_l do just about anything you want her to all the way down to being your alarm clock. I was thoroughly impressed I was in my living room and could talk to her in my bedroom.,2
5,"Great speaker!
  
",5.Nov.19,Yes,"This is my first Echo and I love it. I have friends who have them but older generations. I find the speaker on this to be really clear and full. Alexa, please don_ tell Siri I_ cheating.",1
5,"Big improvement of the first generation.
  
",5.Nov.19,Yes,We absolutely love the newest generation. Sound is much improved over the first generation it replaces. Alexa seems to listen better too. The new design look great and love the new color option.,2

5,"Not happy [**Update :  It's working now, Thanks Amazon support**]
  
",6.Nov.19,Yes,I got this device because it says it does Line-IN.  Of course I get it and it doesn't do LINE IN even though it says it does.  The APP is bugged.  You would think they would test that before releasing it.**Update to 5 stars -- Amazon called and helped get it working.  Happy now :)  Great service-- Thank you!,2
5,"Better than Sonos for way less money? In many cases yes!
  
",6.Nov.19,Yes,"I like this better than my Sonos system with Alexa. You can pair Echos to play throughout your home, and it's easier than trying to setup my Sonos to do the same. You can control the Echo via voice, Alexa app, or through the Amazon Music app. All of these are leaps better than the buggy Sonos app. The sound quality is fantastic and the value for your money is higher than any competitor. I do believe I will be purchasing Amazon Echos from here on out.",10
5,"Sounds better than previous devices, but definitely NOT blue
  
",6.Nov.19,Yes,"If this Echo is blue then I'm a giraffe.It's grey. You can squint really hard and pretend that it has a tinge of blue, but it's G-R-E-Y. Does not look like the pics at all.But it does sound better than previous Echo devices so that's what's most important I guess.",1
5,"Sounds great
  
",6.Nov.19,Yes,Much better sound than my 1st generation Echo. Better looking device as well. Can_ beat the trade in of an old device to upgrade price.,1
5,"POWERFUL, Amazing
  
",6.Nov.19,Yes,My wife has been wanting Alexa for years. I bought it for her the other day. She is tickled. She can listen to her music. The sound is remarkably good. She sets her timers for cooking. She sets reminders. It's capable of doing more than we'll ever need. It's a great addition to our home.,2
5,"Great new device
  
",6.Nov.19,Yes,"The newest iteration of the vanilla Echo has much better sound than the previous generation. I would say it's definitely more of an upgrade from 2nd to 3rd generation in terms of sound than there was between 1st and 2nd. I love the Twilight Blue color, but I do have one question: since the new Echo is the same size and form factor as the Echo Plus (2nd Gen), why not offer that device in the new color? Seems like it should be incredibly easy to do so.",2
1,"No blue tooth.
  
",6.Nov.19,Yes,"Why does my gen2 Alexa have blue tooth, but this new gen3 doesn_?  If blue tooth doesn_ work, it_ likely I_ sending it back and not buying anymore echo products.  I don_ read anywhere that clearly says we took blue tooth away.  It says it_ the same thing just a few enhancements to speakers and such.",10
2,"Beautiful Blue Color, Meh Everything Else
  
",7.Nov.19,Yes,"As an early adopter for Echo v1, I thought now would be a good time to see what kind of improvements Amazon has made to their Alexa platform. I also have Dots in each of my kids room, a fire stick, and a fire 8 tablet. I don't feel this new generation has done anything to make it a better product, other than a great blue color. I feel my first gen sounded better than this one. I actually just moved it to a spare family room downstairs and hooked up my Google Mini again. Meh.",3

",7.Nov.19,Yes,"I own both the 2nd and 3rd generation echos. The sound of the 3rd generation is significantly better. However, I prefer the sharper line of the 2nd over the rounded edges on the 3rd. But, if you are trying to decide which echo to get, this is the one. It worth it for the sound alone.",1
5,"Mostly for Music

5,"Great companion for an elderly person ... the sound is GREAT
  
",9.Nov.19,Yes,"Great so far (2 weeks). I bought it for my elderly aunt (94 years old) and she loves it since she just talks to it and it turns on the radio and she has someone to talk to in the morning.The only problem is she keeps calling her ""Alexis"" instead of ""Alexa"" ... lol. But she is finally getting the name right. Overall, it works great. She keeps the volume up rather high which is why I bought the Echo instead of the smaller one and the sound is great.We'll see who lasts longer.",7

",9.Nov.19,Yes,It_ fine. It_ an Echo so don_ expect it to be an awesome speaker. It does well what it_ designed to do which is fine. I can tell a little bit of an upgrade from my previous 1st generation as far as the sound however it_ not what I use to give me great room filling sound. I happened to purchase it when trading in my old one and getting an extra few bucks off with that so it seemed like a good deal.,2

I had it on shelf with loud deep base music and it fell off. Worked fine after that accident. Lots of music  but you may want to buy Amazon Music Unlimited if you want some music such as Led Zeppelin which is not included in Prime. They do offer a free 30 day trial.,1

",12.Nov.19,Yes,"We had a lot of trouble getting her to connect to Spotify and Apple Music instead of Amazon Music. We gave up after a bit and tried again after an update and then it worked.

",14.Nov.19,Yes,The main problem with this speaker is the sound. :-) Too much bass. No mids. Tinny highs. The result is at lower volumes it sounds terrible. Gets better as it gets louder.,0
4,"Better Sound
  
",14.Nov.19,Yes,"This is a big upgrade in sound over the Echo dot.  While we use it often in our kitchen, know that it is not high end quality sound - what do you expect from one small speaker.  It is plenty good enough for an enjoyable listening experience, especially for background music while working/cooking.  In comparison, the Echo dot sound was just too poor quality to enjoy without hooking up an auxiliary speaker and so we only used it occasionally.  I was surprised that this new unit defaults to Amazon Music rather than Prime music and so we started getting commercials mixed in to our music stream.  It takes time to get the commands right to connect to Prime music without commercials - not an issue we had with the Echo dot that this unit replaced.",12

4,"Gen 3 improvement incremental
  
",14.Nov.19,Yes,"This speaker, after the Gen 2 echo, didn't blow my socks off.  It sounds great, but then my gen 2 sounded very good also.  I also have a pair of gen 2's grouped as a stereo pair, grouped also with an Echo Sub.  I wouldn't even consider replacing those Gen 2's with Gen 3's.  With the Sub doing a bunch of the system's work, the system sounds great to me already.  So if you're buying new, get the Gen 3 for sure (not a used or refurbed set of Gen 2s)  If you have Gen 2s, you probably should keep them.  Unless you are a toy boy like me!",3

",15.Nov.19,Yes,"I have every generation Echo and love them all. One broke only because I dropped it on a granite floor. Other drops have not harmed them.I am not an audiophile, but the sound on this is satisfying for the way I listen. Volume range is great. I listen to pop and rock a great deal, nature sounds for sleeping, and right now some opera arias. I am happy with all of them.The new look is wonderful. I like that it is shorter and wider. More stable on a shelf or table.I do a great deal of house sitting and take many of my own things with me. This is getting packed in that travel bag!The only negative I find is that the fabric cover somewhat covers the light ring on top, and the light seems less bright.Now how do I convince my husband that I need another at home with one in my bedroom and three Dots around the house?",4

",24.Nov.19,No,"As Amazon added new features, they gradually got to the point where they decided to make the Echo You're folksy companion rather than a machine for automation and hands-free work. I turned on brief mode because I don't want a 5-minute conversation when I'm just trying to check the weather or turn on the lights. It didn't work. I still get it to tell me to have a nice day instead of the basic tone it's supposed to play, and sometimes it tries to tell me about new features I don't need when I just want it to read the weather.Sometimes I find it listening after picking up on a word like Election.  This is especially annoying when I'm having a conversation and it chimes in about how it came help me with that.I have both Google and Amazon devices, but I'll be replacing the Amazon ones this year because of the broken features.Update: An Amazon representative contacted me and we spoke about the issues I've experienced. He mentioned that one of them could be resolved by a setting in the app, so it should no longer try to tell me about new features.  I'm actually only updating my review to say that a TV show said ""sure,"" and the Echo just responded to the TV to tell it about Sure brand deodorant. I've unplugged the Echo for now.

1,"Worst alexa device I have bought
  
",25.Nov.19,No,"I already have four Alexas; one previous generation and three dots scattered all over my house. The 2nd generation dots are really nice, and so I thought I'd go with the better sound and latest upgrade for Alexa. The setup was absolutely a dream, and she was up and running in no time. Really liked the better sound, too. But then all of a sudden we began to notice she was just getting too chatty, always asking us if we wanted to do this thing or that thing and THEN...she began asking us if we wanted to be referred to other things to buy! REALLY? I finally found a place in the Alexa app to make her less chatty, but then we noticed that there was a random ""Bloop"", or ""Bloop-bloop."" sound just out of the blue until it was driving us nuts. Not all that often, but way more often than we could stand. Then, the final straw. I have my four alexa devices scattered throughout my house and in a group, so I can just tell Alexa to play some music on all the devices and I'll have music throughout the house. Well, she suddenly just took it upon herself to drop right out of the group! Suddenly, when I told her to play music throughout the house, she would do so, but only on the Alexas that weren't in the main room. THAT'S IT!  I packaged her up and sent her back and wrote this review. I really only want her to answer the questions I ask and not embellish and give me a life history or ask me if I want to go other places. I'm glad I still have my old Alexa. I hooked her back up again and while she may not sound quite as good, she's a lot easier to live with, AND she works, too.",4
5,"Awesome ! I recommend this over the G word.
  
",25.Nov.19,Yes,"I have tried Alexa and I have tried the G word and the A word out performs the G word any day. I lost connection over and over with the G word and so far after more than a month, I have never lost connection with Miss Alexa so I am very happy and being a prime member And being able to pay for it monthly you just can_ beat that so thank you Amazon you will have a prime member as long as I_ around.The bass quality is awesome....the sound quality, and if you don_ know the difference i_ sorry, is awesome and me being an audiophile I don_ use The word awesome lightly.You can_ go wrong with Miss Alexa.",6

",28.Nov.19,No,"I really like the echo 3rd. Gen. I_e never really owned a smart speaker before.  I mainly use mine for music now and then but I do have a big gripe about it. Not so much the device but the amazon music service really sucks imo for a big reason. Now originally I just had this echo and signed up for amazon music unlimited, and for a while it was fantastic ! A few months later I got my hands on a new amazon tap speaker thinking it would be really great to have a speaker play at each side of my room for a more stereo sound. I synced up my new tap to my account , made a speaker group for both devices , requested a song to play and was greeted with _orry to play this song on this group of speakers you need to upgrade your music plan Wait what?! In order for me to use more than one speaker in my one room I need to pay more money? I looked up more info and sure enough yah , you need to pay more money to have the SAME song play one MORE THAN ONE device. Kinda bull shyt  if you ask me. Well just keep that in mind if you plan on buying more than one for expanded sound. That said , some songs play on both with no problem and other times it says I need to pay for an up grade.

The setup was easy but the Alexa app wouldn't connect to the Echo Wi-Fi on the first 2 attempts. I had to reopen the app and try again.The sound quality is amazing, amd fills the room well. Decent bass for a speaker of this size and price. Alexa is a little slow to respond, but typically in less than 1 second she'll answer you. She also has trouble streaming Pandora but it wasn't a show stopper and hopefully will work after a reboot.There's an interesting typo I noticed on my Echo box. ""She makes life easier by letting YOU voice control your world."" Hopefully I didn't receive a knock off from Amazon, but I would think a product like this gets proofread.",1

Because it was over 7 days I could not get a price adjustment. Should have had our anniversary a couple weeks sooner!People at work are waiting for my feedback to see if they should go with one of these and I can say with full confidence they need to pass on this one.Update:20 minutes after I posted this review my phone rang and it was a wonderful person from Amazon by the name of Kristina. She apologized for my experience and showed me how to adjust the bass, treble and midrange to give me the sound the device was meant to put out. She also arranged for me to return the Echo and buy another one to get the sale price. This is the gold standard of customer service that other businesses should strive for.

Sound wise echo is better than the dot, by a fair margin. Is it 1000 dollar studio monitor speakers good? No. Is it worth 60-100 bucks? Absolutely. They sound just as good as any normal pc speakers you would get from Logitech or Harman.If you want to know if the dot or this is worth getting just get this. The dot has good sound quality but only 4 microphones ontop so it's DEAF. It will hear you when it feels like it, this one has like 12 microphones so it will hear you. Get the echo skip the dot.",1

Spoke with tech support and they asked about the wifi connection, saying it could have been interrupted.  I had a 2nd gen dot in the same location with no issues prior.  Router and connectivity is not the problem.  After more questioning and a brief hold, the rep responded there is no known problem with the 3rd gen echo.  Hopefully Amazon will addresses this issues as it appears this is not an isolated instance (do a quick google search).  Until then, I cannot recommend to others.",2
1,"Terrible speech audio
  
",2.Dec.19,Yes,This speaker has no crispness or clarity of speech.  Very hard to understand spoken words. Sounds like the speech is coming from the bottom of a tunnel. The Audio Settings have no effect.  Definitely would not recommend.,1

",2.Dec.19,Yes,"wasn't very keen on any smart speaker. but we decided to buy one with black friday sale price. Was a bit worry about installation, activation, privacy, and what if it's a faulted product?all worries got cleared after we received the product. plugged in. downloaded alaxa app to the phone and connected the echo to wifi. it works beautifully. and it is fun to speak to a speaker to ask she to play a music.The music seems to be mostly working with amazon music.  I still can't figour out a way to ask alaxa to play the music in my phone.One advise to any new Echo users: it's very helpful &amp; useful to google any question (how to... echo...) if you are unsure about how to make echo work.",2

3,"It's an Echo...but crackles when woken...
  
",2.Dec.19,Yes,"We're an Alexa household, with an Echo speaker in almost every room, not to mention our smart plugs, bulbs, and such. So we're in it for the long haul. We went to upgrade our final Echo Dot to a full-fledged Echo. This was our first 3rd Gen (our 2nd Gen Echos are wonderful, so we figured, the 3rd Gen must be even better). The sound quality and ease of setup was second-to-none (comparable to 2nd Gen - no marked improvement - probably given that the 2nd Gen is about perfect). HOWEVER, we stream a lot of music in our home. And Echo usually does a flawless job at it, even syncing across devices. However, one small (arguably nitpicky) problem with this 3rd Gen unit. When you wake this unit while music is playing, it pauses the music as expected to listen to your command; however, after pausing it also sounds a momentary crackle/pop (and by momentary, a teeny-tiny fraction of a second). You start talking to it and it pops. Just enough, however, to drive you mad. And frankly, it's just not acceptable. Not when our other units work perfectly.I contact tech support, and they said that they were able to replicate it, and that it was ""completely normal."" Well, I'm a reasonable person, but this just kind of cheapens the experience, and frankly I'm not convinced it is normal behavior (by the way, we restarted it/reset it/upgraded it/basically everything to try and rectify). And maybe this wouldn't be an issue for most (the speaker is wonderful otherwise), but we use our Echos heavily, often interrupting the music to turn on lights, for example, and I just don't want to hear it pop and crackle when I'm talking to it.",5

",3.Dec.19,Yes,"Absolutely enjoy this purchase!!Bought to pair with my echo plus and firetv 4k. With the *Home Theater update* in the alexa app, creating a 'home theater group' was a breeze.Nice sound quality, no audio delay/sync issues, well constructed... It just works great upon set up.The only con is not with the echo itself, but with volume controls within the alexa app. It would be very beneficial if users were able to control Left/Right channel volume controls independently from one another rather than solely as a pair. (As applies to Home Theater mode only).**NOTE: while in bluetooth mode or in 'stereo set' left/right volume can be controlled independently*Would highly recommend.",2

",3.Dec.19,Yes,"I would not pay $100 for this.  $60 or less is about right.  The sound right out of the box is pretty bland but I did locate some equalizer settings in the Alexa app that made it better. Unfortunately, that's just not enough. I like it loud and when you approach the 3/4 mark on volume the bass drops out and you are left with hollow muffled sound.  Although not up to my rock out level, I found it to be fairly loud considering its footprint. Speaking to Alexa at a pretty decent volume actually worked....No more screaming at the dot from the shower to SKIP!  I suppose I expected more from all of the glowing reviews but considering the build and size of the speaker I should have suspected the performance capability.  This doesn't work for my audio tastes so this will be returned. I hope the Echo Studio performs better.",0
5,"3rd Gen Awesome
  
",3.Dec.19,Yes,"My friends have the 1st and 2nd Gen, when they come to my house up north all I was using was a mp3 player with a Bluetooth speaker. They kept telling me about their Alexa echo and how much they liked it for playing their music. So I ordered one this past black Friday sale. Every week I would have to down load different songs and then load them to the mp3 player now I just have to ask Alexa. It's only been a few days but I am Loving it.

",3.Dec.19,Yes,"The sound on this thing surprised me for its size. I keep the volume between 5-7 out of 10 max, and that's loud and clear enough to fill my medium-sized living roon. Alexa works great, and no complaints there. It would've been nice if it had an internal rechargeable battery, but also makes sense to keep it in your house plugged in the whole time.",0
5,"Fantastic!
  
",3.Dec.19,Yes,"This is my first Alexa speaker, but i've been streaming music for years though various moderately high-end computer speakers and a large selection of bluetooth speakers - everything from cheapies to a 50 watt guitar amp with bluetooth.I'm not an audiophile, but I do like my music to sound good - which, to me, means balanced, not bass-heavy, with good clarity and a high end that doesn't become strident at higher volumes.I bought three of these to have at different locations around the house.  Setup was super simple, d/l the app and sign in to your Amazon account and you're up and running.  No issues at all.Here's what I love so far:  Alexa is super easy to get along with...Alexa, with whom I get along easily...?...has been a treat.  I've been an Amazon music user for a few years now.  I like the selection but using the app on a phone or tablet is a frustrating experience, and it can also be super clunky and slow on a PC, as well.With this speaker I can ask Alexa to play a song, album or playlist and it's playing within moments.  Awesome!  Also, Alexa gave me a detailed, accurate weather forecast this morning.  Nice!  I haven't explored all the features, but I primarily want these for music.And as far as that goes, the sound quality is better than I expected, and I've got no complaints.  I have one speaker on top of my fridge in the kitchen and the sound is just amazing.  Balanced and clear with more than enough bass.  I listened to some jazz, some alt-country, some reggae and some ambient music.  They all sounded great - as good as I could hope for.And Alexa heard me from the next room without a problem.These speakers are well worth their price, and at the Black Friday price they're an incredible value.  These speakers have  removed my Amazon Music frustration (or a large chunk of them, anyway) and allowed me much better access to what I'm paying for.",2

I see reviews that sonos is better, HomePod is better, but really? How can you compare echo to devices that are multiple times the cost. I am hard to please with my devices, and am an Apple guy. However I_e had dots for a couple years and like Alexa. I will keep Apple for mobile devices. For easy to place speakers the house I will use Echo s,art speakers.

",4.Dec.19,Yes,"We got this and was very excited to use it.  However it would not connect.  We tried every way possible.  We tried it thru the app on the phone, thru an amazon tablet, thru a Microsoft surface.  Nothing would work.  We called support.  They needed access to our computer, so I allowed it.  They did all kinds of stuff but not once did they try to connect the device.  I could see everything they were doing.  They had us putting in passwords to the connection etc.. They said our network was at risk etc.  then they tried to sell us stuff. This is the number that was given when it said to call support immediately by the way.  So after we got off the phone with support, we run a scan and all of the sudden our network is not safe....go figure.  My husband is very tech savy and he was quite sure they did something especially since they tried us to buy software to ""fix our network"" and never once tried to connect to the device.  So we had to fix that and then do a factory reset on all of our devices.  I even looked online and tried other option such as rebooting the modem, the router, the echo.  ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WORKED.  The phone we tried to use is a Samsung S10 PLus.I DO NOT RECOMMED THIS PRODUCT!",10

",5.Dec.19,Yes,"I bought this to replace an Echo Dot 3 in my family room. My intention was to get improved audio quality for music.The audio is somewhat better than the Dot3 that it replaced. However, this unit  often fails to hear, or comprehend, my voice commands, and those of my wife, a problem which the Dot 3 that it replaced in precisely the same location never displayed.In fact, the Dot 3 which I moved to an adjacent room often picks up my voice commands when I am speaking to the Echo in the family room, and the Dot 3 is about 3 times the distance away with no direct line-of-sight to the family room.HOWEVER....I was asked to return this item to Amazon, sending it to their Engineering lab. in Sunnyvale, which I did. A couple of days later the replacement unit arrived, and once it was up and running the difference was immediately obvious.The replacement unit will respond to a quietly voiced command from across the room, and misunderstood commands are very, very few.Thanks, Amazon!

I picked up the Echo 3rd gen, and I'm very happy.

One thing that I would love to see in the future is able to set a custom word to wake alexa up.

",6.Dec.19,Yes,"Impressive sound. Bought as Echo Dot replacements in 2 rooms. The old tinning and low volume of those Dots were killing me. These give much better bass and treble, seemingly better than my 2nd Gen Echos.However, if Amazon can't keep these things from randomly stopping my music streaming for no reason, I will be replacing all 7 with Google's home!!!! devices.",0
1,"Incredibly disappointed with Alex and Fire TV integration. False Advertising
  
",6.Dec.19,Yes,"Incredibly disappointed. This was one of EIGHT Fire TV and/or Echo devices that I purchased on Black Friday, hoping to switch from Roku TV and have a seamless smarthome experience. Oh boy, was I wrong.Whether I rename the the Fire TV devices or use their original names, the echo devices CANNOT control or recognize the tv devices, even after properly pairing them under the TV &amp; Video setting in the Alexa app. I've tried to unpair, repair, restart, unregister, reregister, you name it. I've wasted days.  Generally, Alexa responds with 'I cannot find a device named ...' I consider myself very technically savy and I'm positive this is not something that I'm doing wrong. I should've read more into this before buying. TONS of people all over the internet are having this problem. It's infuriating. Plain and simple, until problems like this are fixed, Amazon is blaintantly false advertising the way that their devices work.Other cons to note:-Multiple video apps stutter and sometimes even randomly pause without ever resuming unless you physically resume them.-Alexa drastically lowers the volume of the TV when you are voicing a command. This in-and-of-itself is not a huge problem. However, it becomes a problem often when after the command is complete, Alexa does not resume the original volume of the content. When this has happened, I've had to ask Alexa to turn the volume back up to the specific number it was at.-I have two third generation echos paired as a stereo system for the TV. Often, even though I have my fire TV set as the preferred device, only the echos hear my voice, and once again, because they cannot control the TV, they say that they cannot recognize the device and then I just have to pick up the controller anyway.-The Fire TV will often think that it hears an 'Alexa' when absolutely no where near that word has been stated. Because the volume lowers drastically when Alexa is listening, it creates an obnoxious volume dip in content to listen for nothing when this happens.-You cannot set a sleep timerHonestly I could go on and on about the cons and about just how unhappy I am about these products. There are even more problems than what I listed here, but I'm not wasting too much breath, as after doing days and days of research on these topics, I've seen that Amazon has absolutely no answers to these problems, even after thousands of people have reported the same problems over and over. Unless there is some revalatory software updated coming, I'll be returning hundreds of dollars of equipment.",2

4,"First impressions compared to the Echo Dot 3rd gen
  
",6.Dec.19,Yes,"We only owned a single 2nd gen dot and 2 3rd gen dots. I saw the echo 3rd gen was new and on sale during Black Friday weekend for $60, so I grabbed one. We wanted another echo dot but after reading and watching reviews I decided to spend a bit more and go with a full blown echo.The echo dot 3rd gens are amazing. They really are. For $22 on sale they are especially a no brainer. The sound quality is night and day compared to the 1st and 2nd gen dot. Like twice as good regarding sound quality and fullness and how loud it can get. Alarms will actually wake you.After watching some reviews of the new big echo here, I was sold. Now and then we use the living room echo for some music while we clean or to just goof off and dance like idiots lol. While the dot did good, why not go fuller and louder with the big echo?Well, it_ still an amazing unit. Does all the dot does, of course. However, while the sound is fuller and louder, it_ not going to blow you away. I guess maybe I overhyped it based on the reviews I saw and their reactions, but I was a bit bummed.Yes, absolutely it_ louder...my totally unscientific measurement would be it_ like....15-20% louder and fuller sounding (deep, more bass, higher highs etc). I_ not sure what I was expecting. Maybe I_ be happier regarding sound with the _tudio version? I don_ know. I don_ regret the purchase, though. The extra volume is welcome and it definitely does sound better with music. Happy but I believe I overhyped. If I had the money, I_ def replace the dots with the full echos. Only pluses and no negatives other than being less amazing as I had made it in my own head.",2

5,"Comparing to 2nd Gen Echo
  
",7.Dec.19,Yes,"Sound Quality is an improvement to the 2nd gen echo. After about 2 weeks of moderate usage at 60-70% volume the speaker has sounded better than it did day one, as most speakers need time to break-in.Comparing it to the 2nd gen echo you can definitely hear a difference. There is a bit more low end compared to the 2nd however, I find the mid range to be more refined on the 2nd gen as the 3rd gen has more low end and high end sound.To get this straight. This speaker isn_ meant to provide room filling rich sound as it is only a single firing 3 inch woofer and a tweeter enclosed in a compact plastic housing. If your looking at rich sounding sound docks, bose soundtouch 20 or 30 would fulfill that much better and even though those are more room filling as well, audiophiles will still find it much suited to having an actual speaker and amp setup. I myself am considered an audio snob and I love playing around with audio equipment.I_ not going to compare the echo to a proper 7.2.2 channel setup but compare it to speakers in its class. Being that this is an Amazon Alexa Device it is a very useful tool in addition to your smartphone. I currently have 6 echos throughout the house and they do what they are supposed to do and that is having voice commands for lights and even notifications for your ring system as well as other smart devices you link to your Alexa account. Having the ability to connect Bluetooth to your phone is great as well if your not looking for a portable battery powered Bluetooth speaker.My main reason for purchasing this echo is the new speaker which attracted me to purchasing this and I mainly use it only in the kitchen as having background music and being able to control lights and sound while working on other things. Sound is great for the kitchen and it is plenty loud enough with very balanced sound and I find the bass to be good for it_ size. I would like to put my bose soundtouch in the kitchen but it takes up too much room and I can just place this in a corner and it_ compact enough that you won_ have to worry about knocking it over. However I have setup my echo dot onto a sound dock and linked the multi room audio so I can have music playing through Apple Music in all rooms through the echos which I think is what sets this speaker apart from let_ say the much more expensive Sonos or Bose Soundlinks. Only downside I wish I could do is have Bluetooth work with multi audio instead of having to play playlists or through other streaming services on the echo.",0

5,"Small but mighty!
  
",8.Dec.19,Yes,"I really was hesitant to buy this as it was my first Echo product. I have plans to install a smart thermostat for the house soon. This came with a monthly installment option so I took the chance. At half volume this little thing has amazing sound and although you won't get club bumping base you will get enough to give the song a great sound. You can listen to local radio stations, audio books and other services like Pandora, Apple Music, SiriusXM, Spotify etc so you aren't just limited to Amazon Music.  Alexa hears me well. I can talk like I normally would and she responds. Even  my Siri on my phone has to be yelled at often. The extras like reminders or countdowns to a specific date is great. I set up what orders are due next and she reminds me. I found the trivia of the day fun and interesting. I am actually going back to get another for my bedroom as this one will be in my office and probably move to different areas as needed when guests come over.",1

You can choose X days of the week with reminders but not with daily alarms. So this means that my son who works Monday through Saturday and is only off on Sunday has to be woken up on Sunday morning in order to be woken up Monday through Saturday or unplug the device on Saturday night. Can you believe that? I'm sorry but my mind is absolutely blown that these people who want to be leaders of every technical thing in the world and the shopping leaders of the world have dropped the ball so ridiculously in this department.

4,"Alexa is fantastic, sound less so.
  
",10.Dec.19,Yes,"Bought one of these for the kitchen. It replaces a Memorex Party Cube which had thoroughly degraded over a decade.The functionality of Alexa is discussed at length everywhere and is amazing. My only issue with this device is the sound quality. I think it's inherent to the design and I did anticipate this. First of all, the bass is astounding. I didn't know something this size could create that kind of bass. I'm afraid treble is another story. In order to create the 360 degree sound, the tweeter (as you can see in the product description) is pointed upward inside the device. It fires internally. The midrange radiates quite well out of the unit as reflected sound. However, the high frequencies (say, above 14khz) do not fare so well. So overall the treble slopes off quite a bit. The old Party Cube, like the Sonos One, has outward firing tweeters, so you are not relying on sound reflection for what you hear - you get the whole spectrum straight from the source, like conventional speakers. So you miss a bit of the magic of vocals, or drum high hats, atmospheric sounds and the like. Out of the box the overall tone is weighed quite a bit to mid bass. Alexa has some basic tone control (Bass, Midrange, Treble) which can help just a bit.Overall though, the Pros outweigh the cons on this device and I'm happy to have it!",0

",10.Dec.19,Yes,I love my Echo's.  This is a perfect addition to my Echo Plus and other various dots.  I have them connected around the house mainly for music.  The Echo has much better sound than the Dot so they go in the rooms most open to guests.  The dots are used to fill in the back rooms where the lower quality won't be noticed as much.  So much other functions to offer but for now this is their main function.  Thank you Amazon!,1

I cant seem to get Alexa to do anything but play music, and even then the system likes to at the least convient time switch from spotify to amazpn music if your wording isnt perfect. Keep an eye on these smart homes, if this was a person they would be boarding the short bus to go a nice soft padded room for the rest of time.",0

",11.Dec.19,Yes,"Honestly, I thought I got better sound performance from my Gen1 echo than this one. My old one broke and the program to trade in plus black Friday made this a good deal so hard to complain too much.Overall I would NOT call this a premium product. It's passable and the interface with other smart home products is good but it sort of feels like Amazon is cheaping out on the product now that consumer adoption is near saturation. Basically a bait and switch from Amazon; initial model is high quality to attract customers and once you have them, bring out a cheaper model.Pros- easy to setup, even for those who aren't tech savvy- interfaces with other smart products well- good deal on sale- great gift if someone doesn't haveMeh- app is not as controllable as I would like- voice recognition is ok. Basic commands are flawless but anything more is beyond its capabilitiesCons- speaker sound quality- asking questions gives irrelevant responses- media player in app kinda sucks to control. For example, switching from one speaker to multiple room is a little challenging in app once the music is playingI felt the same way about the echo auto. Not well engineered, just forced a product out and people are left disappointed with the results. Won't be purchasing again once this one breaks.",1

",12.Dec.19,Yes,"The sound quality sounds so cheap and overly bassy. There is a much longer delay when requesting Alexa perform any actions. I also have to repeat requests sometime several times for any action to take place. Several times I'll request something and Alexa repeats a completely random request instead. I regret opting-in on the trade-in offer as I prefer my ""old"" Gen 2 devices, which were accepted at a greatly reduced amount. The tech support offered me nothing as they don't seem to know about their own products. It is not giftable as I don't believe it's a good product.",3
5,"The best yet!
  
",12.Dec.19,Yes,The sound quality when combined with Amazon music is absolutely top shelf. I usually purchase bose speakers but I must say this is same as or greater than in quality! My advice is that after you buy it you go into the settings and tweet the bass up just a bit.,0

5,"We love our Echo devices
  
",13.Dec.19,Yes,I got this as an upgrade for my 2nd generation Echo Dot with a Vaux speaker. The Vaux speaker quite holding it charge and was powering off the Dot so I moved the Dot to the bluetooth connection on my entertainment system and got the new Echo for the living room. This little speaker sounds really good and looks so much better than previous generations. When we got our first Echo it was more of a novelty for playing music but has become much more.,0

",13.Dec.19,Yes,"I had a little confusion on my part when installing,.  I had purchased an Echo Dot, believing this was what I needed.Found out I needed the 2 items in order to incorporate the Dot.I guess I need a long cord to connect the two units.Overall, a friendly, helpful, convenient and fun device when I need a quick answer, or an urge to play some music I don't hear anymore on today's radio or TV.",0
3,"Buy more dots and less echos

5,"Love it!
  
",13.Dec.19,Yes,I love everything about it. I'm still learning and wish there were little tutorials. But we're getting there...,0
5,"I use it for music mostly
  
",13.Dec.19,Yes,"I love this. I use it mostly for music, alarms and ordering from Amazon. So many more possibilities but I use the apps for my security cams. I have an iPad so I see no need for the show me feature. But if you have a lousy,  slow, ring app, I think that would be the hot shot.  I tore the ring doorbell out with my bare hands I was so pissed. By the time you open the app everything that was going to happen has already happened whoever was at the door is already gone. By the time the app opens, everything that was going to happen has already happened. So the show me feature has got to be quicker than the ring app and would be a nice addition to alexa. Then I_e connected _he dots.. I wondered why they call them dots, now it all makes sense. I use the dots for stereo sound in my home. They all work the same as Echo. You don_ need Echo to have the dots either. Dots are smaller so the speaker is smaller, that_ all. Great for smaller rooms and still have a good quality speaker. Better privacy controls on these. You can turn off the speaker manually and if you want delete everything you said that day you can do that too. Ask Alexa to do it for you. Decent app. Play with the settings. Good deal all around.",1
5,"Perfect
  
",13.Dec.19,Yes,I purchased this and 3 echo dots. One in my bedroom. My bathroom. My kitchen. And the echo in my living room.  I have absolutely no complaints. Easy to set up. Easy to connect all 4 together.,0

5,"Sounds great!!
  
",13.Dec.19,Yes,I wanted one of these after seeing an older version in action at a friends hours. I got the 3rd gen cause the reviews said the sound was better. It sounds SO GOOD. I_ seriously addicted to this thing. Idk how I lived without Alexa this long!,0
5,"Replaced my Google home
  
",13.Dec.19,Yes,I was debating getting another Alexa. I outfitted my home with Google home. While google worked it was slow and sometimes unresponsive. Alexa was always on point with great sound. When the product (red) line was released I hade no doubt I was replacing google home with the new echo red. I love it so much better. I only wish the echo dot was also in product (Red).,0

",15.Dec.19,Yes,"i am an old guy, I don't hear some highs or some lows very well. I have four echo dots. Music from all sides was/is great. Then I bought this echo. If I play it at it's loudest, it blows me away! It was hard to detect the dots though. But I turned down to about 75% and my living room sounds like a live concert no matter what genre I play (I love most music from classical, opera, old rock, old rock &amp; roll, blues old and new all the way up to today's heavy metal!) Thanks so much Amazon! Amazing sound set up without using a months wages!",2

",15.Dec.19,Yes,I really like this speaker.  Sounds great for being so small. I have 3 second generation and 1 3rd gen. To be honest I can_ tell the difference between the two.

",15.Dec.19,No,"I used my older Echo to listen to Amazon music.  After I bought the gen 3, I found I couldn_ play songs on it with my current plan which cost $3.99 a month.  If I wanted to use the gen3 , the cost per month would triple. Even though I called the Amazon help line, no one told me I would have to pay triple the money to play Amazon music.  I decided to pay the extra because the sound is very good, but after three days, the gen3 stopped working.  My older one is still working.  I_ returning the gen3, and going back to the older one.

",16.Dec.19,Yes,"Great speaker. I had too many things connected via Bluetooth to my iPad register in my store and my printer would keep disconnecting.

5,"Improvement over the second gen
  
",16.Dec.19,Yes,"I bought the third gen to replace my second gen. The sound is much better, a little shorter and rounder at the top. I bought two additional as gifts.

5,"Upgraded speaker sound __
  
",16.Dec.19,Yes,I got this to upgrade an area in a large room from an Echo Spot to something with a better speaker. This is exactly what I was looking for. The sound is richer and fuller and fills the open space better. I moved the Echo Spot to a bedroom instead and this Echo is perfect in an open concept space.,0
5,"I love it.
  
",16.Dec.19,Yes,"I liked the sound and everything only thing is that sometimes she doesn_ even listen, you say _lexa she turns on but then turns back off like I wasn_ talking. And sometimes gets slow and i only have like 2 weeks with it.",0

5,"Didn't know how much I needed this!!!!!
  
",16.Dec.19,Yes,"I'm truly loving my Amazon Echo, the sound from this speaker is fantastic for playing music, audio books.  I like that it connects to more products than any of the other similar devices out there and even connects to my Apple music and playlists.  I use it to operate my Hue Lights, play my Audible audio books, music, make phone calls, send messages, create grocery lists.  There more that can be done, I'm new to the Echo so each day I'm learning. One of the things I like also is that you can, with the touch of a button, mute the device if you don't want it ""listening"" for some reason.  I now want Amazon Echo's in every room, you can even use them like intercoms also.  You'll be happy with your purchase, I promise!",0

4,"Almost there
  
",16.Dec.19,No,"The echo is an impressive speaker. Sound is incredible for such a tiny speaker at that price. I would give 6 stars for that.However there are so many things making the Alexa echo annoying, that should be fixed:- the voice recognition is awful when you are used to Google- Most of the time say something, Alexa will answer ""I don't know"". It is faster to use the thermostat app to set the AC than to talk to Alexa- Playing music from the app is a nightmare (it only works through the desktop alexa website) and you need a paid service to play the music you want- The stereo sound does not work in bluetooth- There should be more Alexa integration in IFTT You cannot control Alexa as a Then clause",1

5,"A great little speaker
  
",16.Dec.19,Yes,"We needed something in our livingroom with a bit better sound quality than our existing Echo Dot. This certainly filled the requirement nicely. If you don't need the built in hub included in the more expensive model then this is a good choice. We moved our existing Dot into a room we did not care about sound, which worked out nicely",0
5,"Good for its price
  
",16.Dec.19,Yes,"Works great with Apple Music. Sound Quality is great at mid range, but if you turn the volume higher it almost sounds as if the speakers a ripping. Its great for apartments but if you wanna add it to a big house its not worth it. Great design.",0
5,"Good value for money,  and SOUND...
  
",17.Dec.19,Yes,"Alexa Echo always understands my words. And the speaker performance of this product seems to be good in echo.The bass of the sound is similar to BOSE speaker. However, the balance between the treble and bass at high treble is broken. Therefore, it is not suitable for the purpose of listening to loud music.For that, I recommend buying Sonos One for listener to loud music.",0

5,"Significant Upgrade over Generation 1
  
",17.Dec.19,Yes,"Bought this to replace a public beta-era Generation 1 unit. The first gen unit had slowed down a bit, and was beginning to struggle with running our smart home components, missing light bulbs and other things in the Hue network.This thing is FAST compared to earlier models. What would take 5-10 seconds of processing for the gen-1 takes only a second or two for this model. The sound quality remains excellent for music playback, and while the model is ""fatter"" it is noticeably shorter, making it slightly more subtle for where I have mine (on a table next to a wall).If you're looking to get your first Echo or upgrade from an older model I definitely recommend making the change.",0

",17.Dec.19,Yes,I am sure I will like the product but cannot believe how this was shipped. It was just put into a packing envelope.  This item is a little more substantial and comes in its own box so in turn it should have come in a bigger shipping box not a packing envelope.  There was a about 4000 pounds of tape and the box for the item was all crushed.  Hope it is not damaged but will not find out until xmas morning.  1 star for packing probably 5 star for product.,1
3,"Not what I expected
  
",17.Dec.19,Yes,I bought to replace an echo dot. This unit cannot hear me from the same distance as the dot and it has more trouble understanding than the dot.,0
1,"Started failing after about a month, and I didn't have time to call support.
  
",17.Dec.19,Yes,"I got this for my Dad, who is blind and in a nursing home, to replace a refurb Echo Dot.  I did this when I visited him, 1500 miles away.  It worked flawlessly, the sound and bass is awesome, and then it failed the day before I was flying home.  He would ask it to play music by some artist, and it would say it was going to play that artist, and then silence.  Nothing.  I power-cycled it and it started working fine.  Then, simply power-cycling it didn't work.  Although the light ring indicated that it recognized the wake word, it wouldn't even tell me the time.  Again, the refurb Dot worked.  A few hours before leaving him to prepare for my flight, I unplugged it and plugged in the Dot; redundancy.  After about an hour, I unplugged the Dot and plugged the new Echo in.  Worked great!  However, I was not confident that it would work for the 3 months I'm away, and didn't have the time to get on the phone with support for a replacement.  Well, it failed again, and I really can't do anything about it other than buy him another.  You see, I've been on the phone with support for another failed Echo, and I doubt that I could get a replacement authorization without being physically present, hence the low score for support.  And after mid-January, I won't be able to have it replaced.  Don't get me wrong, I love the Echo in general.  I have an Echo, Echo Plus, Echo Connect and three Echo Dots.  Statistically, I've had good luck with the Echo products, which is why I purchased a new one for my Dad.  Maybe I'll call support and see if I can get a replacement now, 1500 miles away and unable to touch it.  If I can get a replacement, I'll give it 5 stars, since when it works, the sound is incredible (well, in a nursing home room).",0

It looks great in my  bedroom and the sound is awesome for such a small device! I got addicted to the even smaller Echo Dots a few months back and now have 9 of them scattered throughout my home, shop and garage. These darn things seem to be multiplying, somewhat like tribbles! So now I have the regular ""mommy"" sized Echo and a 2nd Red one on the way! I am really enjoying all of these Echo's, and I love this Red one! The red is not as deep looking as what is on the ad, but it is attractive. It's got kind of a coral tinge to it, but it brightens up my room.

",17.Dec.19,Yes,"Since I had an Echo in the Family Room, I decided to buy 2 Echo Dots for the Master Bedroom and the Computer Room to act as intercoms.  I keep the sound at a reasonably level for music, questions, and timers/reminders/alarms, but it is too hard to hear the other room when I DROP IN.  There needs to be a skill that can do multiple steps so I can increase the sound at each end, listen/talk, then set the sound back to the original level when I'm done using  as an intercom.",0

",18.Dec.19,Yes,"I am in love with this generation of Echo! I read several of the reviews before purchasing, and previously have only owned the Echo Dot. Wow. What a major sound quality difference! This has become my go-to for music when I'm cooking, cleaning and in general doing anything that needs some motivation around the house. The bass is impressive for such a small thing - nice deep, non-fuzzing lows with some serious thump I actually felt on the floor. (The Echo is placed on my kitchen table) I ran through quite a gamut of music from Home Free, Post Malone, Star Wars instrumental, a little In This Moment and I was pleased with the quality of them all.If you see this lil puppy on sale - snap it right up!I can't wait to host a party and get this Echo bumpin'!",0

",18.Dec.19,Yes,I bought Echo on a 5 month payment plan at regular price 2 weeks before Black Friday.  Unfortunately Amazon would not give me the sales price adjustment even though I still owed 4 months on plan.I wasn't offered any work arounds to take advantage of 40% off sale.  Too much trouble to return and re-purchase.  Disappointed but Echo is a fine product.,0

4,"Stereo?
  
",18.Dec.19,Yes,"Overall I love this product. Comparable sound quality to other similar priced and size products (JBL Pulse). The main issue for me is I already had a 3rd gen dot. I specifically wanted to buy another Echo product to pair for stereo and have some bass. Originally, I was going to get another dot and the sub. However I grabbed this Echo when it was on sale $60! The sub seems overpriced so I had hoped this would pair with the dot and give me the low end that I needed. I searched everywhere to see if an Echo and a dot would pair and could not find an answer! I had hoped that since both were the newest generation they would pair. NOPE! One workaround, you can play both simultaneously in the same room if you setup multiroom sound. However, the two will still not be stereo which pisses me off. AMAZON please fix this glitch. Why on earth can you not pair ANY two Echo products? Especially the same generation models? So can a Echo and an Echo+ not be paired either?",4

5,"Echo Set Up
  
",18.Dec.19,Yes,"The echo will do alot of things.  The most important things has to be programmed into it.  Programming it isn't the easiest thing to do.

",19.Dec.19,No,"I got mine free from Verizon for signing up with Fios and immediately turned off the mic.  The Speaker is fine for what it is and I use it for music and movies and youtube at my desk.  But it periodically yells out ""Now Playing from Gg38elskugoksldkfs;odivfsdf"" or some odd string of characters and it's always jarring and often times scares the hell out of me.  Sometimes I hear it making that same announcement from the other room when I'm not even using it.  It would be great if they could create a setting that replaces this and all vocal response with a simple series of light flashes.  Ultimately I like this little speaker but this random yelling out issue has got me close to unplugging it.  I just turned on Brief Mode under vocal responses to see if that helps.  ""Alexa, please speak only when spoken to"".",0

",19.Dec.19,Yes,"I have been using Echo devices for a couple of years now, i have 18 of them in 2 locations, each time they upgrade I upgrade, I run almost all of my lighting and a few plugs from my echo's, listen to music, have 2 of them and a sub connected thru my HD Fire tv stick for a upgraded movie sound experience that does really good, and i ask questions which alexa usually answers or gives me the information I am asking for. As in any electronics or computer device they have a few bugs that get worked out, the sound quality is great to me, and gets better every time they upgrade, I'm definitely not disappointed.  For the money, they are well worth it. If you want a better sounding speaker go by an expensive speaker that is meant just for being a speaker. They suite my needs very well.",0

",20.Dec.19,Yes,"I am not a techy person and didn't really care for the home devices until I got an Echo Alexa. I love her! She does it all- tells jokes, plays music, reads recipes, makes shopping lists, etc. Great gift idea for anyone.",0

4,"Decent speaker
  
",20.Dec.19,Yes,"I bought on black friday or cyber monday so the the 60 bucks I spent was a great price for a decent speaker. I use it for music only so far, and it's fun to have at parties. Everyone takes turns asking Alexa to play their favorite songs.",0
3,"So so quality
  
",20.Dec.19,Yes,I bought one of the Echo Dots and really liked it. Heard that the larger Echo had better sound so I bought one. On my echo the sound was not as good as my Dot and the Echo mishears what I sa more often. Save the extra bucks and just get the Dot.,0
5,"Truly awesome!
  
",20.Dec.19,Yes,"I didn't expect this kind of sound coming out of an echo device! I'm seriously impressed!  The sound is crisp and rich and even has some decent bass with out a subwoofer!

I highly recommend this product!",0
5,"definitely worth the upgrade!
  
",20.Dec.19,Yes,"I had a Bose surround sound set up in the family room but was tired of the wires. I had bought a sound bar but wasn_ impressed with the sound when I played my music and watching tv/movies. So I bought 2 of these and paired them as _ront speakers with the new update (I have the Fire Tv Cube). My only gripe is that the volume only goes to 10 which is fine for Amazon Music but when certainty shows or movies with action scenes come into play, it doesn_ sound as loud as I would like it. I plan on purchasing the Echo sub soon and maybe the 2 new Echo Studios when the funds are available. A little pricey at $199 each which output Dolby Atmos. Maybe by then more movies and tv shows will output in that format.",0
1,"Can not find its current location
  
",20.Dec.19,Yes,"I had a hard time to set it up and update my current location and since I did not able to change it even after I changed my address in the app, I returned it.It was set to an address in Los Angeles and it seems that like the address and it did not want to move from there.

But, maybe it is just a sentiment me, the V1 seems to respond better and the audio is clearer then the V3.  I have to talk louder to the V3...and even then sometime I have to repeat.  I am still using the V1 unit and often stream on both.  I still have a 5 star rating on the V1, but feel the V3 is a bit of a disappointment.  I will give it more time...",1

5,"This tech has come pretty far
  
",20.Dec.19,Yes,"Ive been waiting to buy any smart products as I didnt want to waste what little mkney i had for tech. I am a student and most of tech budget goes to stuff i want to study. I messed around with alexa and google and siri here and there, but was never all too impressed. The tech has really been streamlined and alexa has learned quite a bit. The voice recognition has significantly improved and the smart gadgets it can control are getting more common. I bought this with an echo show and an echo input and an echo auto. The intercom function has been helpful twice already (10 days of use) and the sound is impressive. I was surprised by how clear and loud it is at max volume. The echo auto, used in conjunction with my echo at home is fantastic. I can control all my lights, my tv, my xbox, and more from my car. From anywhere, actually. More awesome is the fact that my car is not a cornucopia of technological advancements. All i have in there is a cigarette lighter and an aux input. All things considered, this product, and several of its other echo partners, was an awesome purchase. Especially at sale prices!5 stars.",1

",20.Dec.19,Yes,Sounds amazing!I had the echo dot connected to an external speaker and doubted whether the echo 3rd gen will sound better. Bought it to try and test it against what I had.... By now I can tell u that the echo 3rd gen sounds much better. Love the sound quality!,0

5,"Alexa is my hero
  
",21.Dec.19,Yes,"I bought this and was not sure I really wanted it. I mostly wanted a speaker to stream my music while I worked... but oh my god. Alexa is my new love (sorry Siri). One thing I love is how she can add things to my shopping or to-do lists so easily and it goes right into the app. This helps when I lay awake at night unable to sleep because I know I need to make a list of things to do the next day... so I can get it quickly off my mind and go to bed.Well, I loved it so much I bought 2 echo dots. One for the kitchen and one for the kids room so now I can easily drop into the kids room and let them know dinner is ready without having to march up the stairs or scream like a banshee.",0
4,"Sounds ok
  
",21.Dec.19,Yes,I bought this because I wanted better sound for my music. The quality is not any better than the dot. It is louder but no base for the music i like to listen to. Save your money and just buy a good blue tooth speaker.,0
5,"Going from the echo dot to the echo is a big difference in sound
  
",21.Dec.19,Yes,"I currently own the echo dot 2 and a couple of the 3rd generation dots. I would always listen to my Amazon Music playlist while I cleaned around the house. I needed something with a bit more volume and sound so I went with this 3rd generation echo. The difference is definitely worth the upgrade. Voice recognition is better among other things. I love all of the features that Alexa has to offer. My son who is almost two has just recently started talking and he will randomly blurt of ""lexa playyyy shots!"". Of course he doesn't emphasize the A in Alexa so I help him out a bit and he gets a big ole grin on his face when Lil Jon and LMFAO start to play. The Alexa skills are great. The Guard mode when away also allows Alexa to listen for smoke alarms and glass breaking. This would result in a notification pushed to your phone. I would love for them to ad a feature that allowed several echo's to monitor these sounds while home. With one in the basement, kitchen, living room, and upstairs bedroom, It would be amazing if Alexa could hear a smoke detector from the basement or kitchen and then alert my bedroom echo with a very loud alarm. This would allow me to wake up much sooner since it takes a bit for smoke to get upstairs. Even then, Its hard to hear a smoke alarm in a hallway when you run a fan or window AC all night. Who wouldn't want to get out of the house before a fire got out of control? Amazon....please consider this feature. It would definitely save lives. It could even save households that keep fire extinguishers on hand. Anyways, buy this echo. You won't regret it.",1

2,"Only works with Amazon music :'(
  
",21.Dec.19,Yes,"I regretted this purchase and returned the item. I bought this because I have a big living room and I wanted to have a great sound system playing on multiple devices at the same time. Unfortunately this only works with Amazon music!My music provider is Google play music, where I have all my Playlist and saved videos, and YouTube. There was no way to play my music on the speaker. I was so shocked I thought it was user error, so I contacted customer service and they confirmed that there was no way to play my music from Google play music to this speaker.In general I've found these Echo devices really difficult to setup, you need wifi and Bluetooth and it only works for Amazon music, and it only works when plugged in.I'm so used to regular speakers that have a battery, and that just work over Bluetooth. I'm very disappointed with Amazon Echo devices.I ended returning this product.Pros :- quick shippingCons:- only works with Amazon music, doesn't work with YouTube or Google play music- hard to setup, hard to tell when the device is plugged in or not",1

For me, the difference isn't great enough to make it the single most important reason for the upgrade, but the line in jack was what sold me.  I wanted something for the devices I have that do not have Bluetooth and the slightly bigger sound is just a nice bonus. As usual it is easy to set up and performs as expected.Even though I can't make a stereo pairing with my Second Gen Echo, having them at opposite ends of the room and creating a group for them mmore than fills the room with very nice sounding audio so am quite pleased with my purchase.",0

3,"Good product hardly any bass
  
",23.Dec.19,Yes,"The product is tons better than the original dot.. they shouldn_ really be compared. But the bass is seriously lacking.. I have a similar speaker in size of this one, and the bass response is much better on that one. Outside of this for lower volume listening like at a desk, or while cooking, this is wounderful!On a side note, I tried to measure the response, it seems that anything below a certain Hz is cut. So the low bass is almost muted.",0
5,"It records us.
  
",23.Dec.19,Yes,"The speaker works as described.  But, I unplug it when not in use.  I understand that it records your conversations.  And, you have no way to delete or access what it records.  Can we believe that little red button keeps it from recording us?",0

",23.Dec.19,Yes,This echo is great make life at home easily managed,0
5,"Quality Sound
  
",23.Dec.19,Yes,"This new Echo has very good quality sound. It took the place of an Echo Dot (smaller unit) that was in our living room. The Dot worked great however we moved it to the bedroom and replaced it with the Echo and as a result it provides great sound, clearer audio and it looks great as well. We found that we can use a lower sound setting and achieve clear sound and great volume. We like both units and now they are in locations that suit them best.  We use them for our 6 wi-fi outlets as well and they work great through the Alexa app or voice command. I highly recommend either one of these units. Just consider up front the size area and type of sound quality you are looking for. Thanks!",1

",24.Dec.19,Yes,"Decided to take the plunge and get an Echo on black friday deal.  I was a bit dubious of how useful it would be, and the jury is still out on that.  Maybe once I hook it up to a bunch of smart devices, its utility will become clearer.  For now, I am impressed with the amount of tech, voice recognition, sound quality in a small package, that you can for a relatively low price.  So far, I'm not disappointed with the purchase.",0

",24.Dec.19,Yes,"I replaced an Echo dot with this. The bass has a ""tubby"" quality to it: a mid-bass hump or two that comes up short of what I was hoping for in terms of sound quality. Re-positioning doesn't seem to help so it's definitely a manufacturing/tuning issue. Otherwise it works fine as an Alexa device.",0

3,"Great speaker with a serious flaw.
  
",24.Dec.19,Yes,"The sound quality is excellent and the Alexa function is great. However, there is one serious flaw of the echo. When playing music over Bluetooth, the volume is extremely low. It needs to turn all the way up to have a reasonable volume for music. But by then, the Alexa volume is way too loud. Sadly, there is no way to sync the volume level of the music and Alexa. Another minor glitch is when playing amazon music to stereo pair of echo, there is always a few seconds of noise before the music starts. It would be to mute them before the music starts.",0

",24.Dec.19,Yes,"This unit is much improved over my first generation Echo, although I do miss the volume ring that was on the original. Voice recognition and the ability of it to hear you over music is much, much better.  Sound quality is also improved, but it goes from good to amazing sound when you pair it with another echo for stereo sound. I paired it with a 2nd gen. Echo plus and it just sounds great! I may add the echo sub at some point but it really doesn't need it once paired and in stereo.",0

",25.Dec.19,Yes,"A little buggy. Has trouble switching between different devices streaming to it. Had to delete and reinstall the app to get it to work with my TV.  I have both the Echo and the Dot and the multi-room music works well. Only complaint right now is that there is no integration with YouTube Music. I can't have Alexa play music from YouTube Music without streaming directly from my phone,  which defeats the purpose.  Amazon's unlimited music service is less than half the cost of YouTube Premium, so that's a good reason to switch I guess- but then I lose the ability to watch ad-free videos on YouTube.  Maybe I just talked myself into it.  I don't really watch YouTube videos. I'll probably check out the library on Amazon Unlimited Music and see if it compares.",0

5,"Great upgrade
  
",25.Dec.19,Yes,Great upgrade from previous versions. Tech support is lacking severely. When calling you get indian support that is extremely basic. The speaker itself is great high treble and low bass not too big and not too small. Looks great in any setting with the color options.,0

5,"Get a pair and add the subwoofer! &lt;3
  
",25.Dec.19,Yes,"I bought two of these little gems, with a sub woofer. I synced  them all together to create my own little home sound system. The deep base of the subwoofer really adds to the already well-balanced sound of the third generation devices. I_ not super excited about the voice recognition. I gave it four stars. I_ hoping that as these devices learn how I talk, and the technology gets better, it will be more smooth to use. Right now, Alexa only gets 2-3 out of five commands right. That_ frustrating! The sound, though... makes this purchase worth it.",0
5,"Great
  
",25.Dec.19,Yes,"I don't like the glowing light ring but other than that, we love it .",0
1,"Amazon can't even make it pair with a phone!
  
",25.Dec.19,No,"I gave my mom an Echo and I just wanted to pair with it to play Christmas music and when I try to pair Amazon's incompetent designers want to force me to use the app and then, apparently, take the device from my mom's account and add it to mine! All I want to do is pair my phone to her Echo and play some music. EVERY other bluetooth speaker manufacturer seems to understand that. Don't waste your money on this thing. Even trying to play music over Amazon Music can be painful thanks to the problematic speech recognition - it's pretty good for basic use, but for album and song titles it's extremely flaky. It normally defaults to playing the title track of an album rather than the entire album, for instance.Unfortunately Amazon won't allow me to submit a review with no stars whatsoever.",0
5,"Great to play music and love mute
  
",25.Dec.19,Yes,I got this to play music while doing household work and cooking.  I love the timer and I love most of the little weather things I get.  I do not have a smart house so it is limited use.  But I do love the sound quality.  I also enjoy that if I do not want anything to be heard I can hit a mute button (not that I have anything to hide).  But love the option.,0
5,"Alexa. Where would I be without you!
  
",25.Dec.19,Yes,i had the 1st generation Echo that I bought from a friend in 2016. I loved it. The sound quality was amazing. It did amazing things. I played fun games on it. I got the weather. I set timers. I made shopping lists. I shopped on Amazon with it. Alexa woke me up. Alexa said good night. She turned on my lights and even set light timers for me. In time there won't be anything that we can't do with Alexa. She just keeps getting better and better and I have seen that progress since I first plugged her in back in 2016. I traded in my 1st gen Echo though Amazon. I told them the condition and right on the spot I had my trade in money to use towards the new 3rd gen Echo. They even gave me a shipping label to send it back to them and when they got it there was no issue with the trade in value I received.This new 3rd gen echo is great. The sound quality is far better than the 1st gen and that one sounded great regardless of how loud I played music. Alexa keeps getting better and am happy to have one.. well many now as I have one in each room. Highly recommended. It is life changing and the price is incredible for what you are getting and all the different ways you can use Alexa. I can't wait to see what happens next.,0

5,"Impressive Sound
  
",25.Dec.19,Yes,I recently purchased an Echo Dot for my son and was pleased with the sound for such a small device. I then decided to by this full sized Echo for my wife. The sound is very good. The bass is surprisingly good and the mids and highs are excellent. I can't imagine getting better sound for the money ($59.99 on sale). The voice recognition works well in English. I haven't tried it in Spanish yet.,0
5,"Great

4,"Echo upcharges
  
",25.Dec.19,No,"I was surprised that so many items are an extra charge or monthly charge. I wanted echo mostly for music, but you cannot ask for a specific song or vocalist without paying a monthly fee. Not a good feature. It's an amazing product if you want to pay for all the available items.",0
3,"Love it but it could be a lot better
  
",25.Dec.19,Yes,"I went from an echo dot to the echo 3. Along the way I also bought a new echo dot current generation. I found that the sound on my new dot to be amazing, not too much difference from the echo 3. That_ were I find that the echo 3 is lacking.Another problem that I_e recently been noticing is the connectivity is not stable. In several ocasiona, it starts playing a song and abruptly turns off.

",25.Dec.19,Yes,"In the morning I ask Alexa what time it is since my alarm didn_ go off just yet. I ask how the weather is and is going to be. Through Alexa I turn my TV on and off, certain lights in my home on or off. I enjoy this technology very much. I also get my radio stations through Alexa, and the sound through Alexa is great. She also reads me bible verses as well, tells jokes and keeps me updated on the news. Like I said, I love it and I bet you will too.",0

Oh yeah, the twilight blue is a great color also.",0

5,"Richer Sound!
  
",25.Dec.19,Yes,"This is our 8th Alexa device. It has a much richer sound and base than the other devices we own.

",25.Dec.19,Yes,"We got this to add more sound to our house (we have echos in most of our rooms now, but most of them are dots, and we wanted some richer sound in the livingroom.  This is certainly better than the dot, but our echo show in the kitchen has better sound, and I was a bit surprised by that.  Still like this though.",0
5,"Worth it

4,"Awesome with sub
  
",26.Dec.19,Yes,2 of these with the sub is really a nice combination.  Once they allow the Echo and Sub to be used with a fire TV for a 2.1 then this would be a 5 star amazon solution to both music and basic home theater.,0
3,"Not good enough!

",26.Dec.19,Yes,"I ordered the new third generation Echo on Black Friday. What upset me right off the bat is that it was shipped to me in a flimsy Tyvek envelope. No extra packing for protection. As for the unit itself, it  is very similar to the second generation Echo. The sound is a little bolder with more base response. The only issue, so far, is with the end of request response sound when it is switched on in settings. For no apparent reason, it occasionally blares at full volume at the end of request response. The only remedy is to turn off the end of request sound in settings. No such issue with my first and second generation Echoes.",0

5,"Alexa is a good listener
  
",26.Dec.19,No,My husband got this for Christmas.  I thought maybe Alexa will listen to him and do what he says!  _. She does.  It was easy to set up.  We got an echo plus in our kitchen and put the dot in our room.  It_ awesome and fun.,0

4,"It will get better with time.
  
",26.Dec.19,Yes,Not as easy as lead to believe.  Had some issues getting it to link with the echo dot.  I still can_ get it to play music from one main source to the other echo dots.  Cones on even when the name isn_ called and it_ in privacy mode.,0
1,"Command accuracy and wakeword sensitivity
  
",26.Dec.19,Yes,Not as good understanding of the wale word as the 1st gen. My dot is quicker picking up the WW even it is in the far end of the living room. Had to unplug the dot just so that I get to use this device more often. It also often dies on itself when alarm goes off. Had to unplug to restart. Sound is superior of course.,1

5,"Great for the price.
  
",26.Dec.19,Yes,"So, after buying and trying a couple of echo dots, I bought 2 of these 3rd gen echo_. I must say I was quite impressed with the sound after the dots. I also paired with an echo sub and a 4K Firetv Stick. With the Alexa app, the capability is there to set up a _heater system. Actually it works pretty well. Setup took about 15 minutes including the speaker software/firmware updates.Sound.....So I_e had for the last 20 years a 5.1 system with different high end receivers and Paradigm speakers. Now, I was NOT looking to duplicate the sound that system produced but, I was looking for something decent. Actually these 3rd gen_ paired with the little echo sub do pretty well. I_e actually had quite a few people over that had in the past enjoyed my other system for _ovie nights or just sitting around playing cards listening to music, and they_e all been impressed. Enough so that most are looking at setting up the same system at home.I_ not going down the road of specs and stats. I_ just going to say I_ impressed and would purchase all again.I_ hoping in the future there will be a firmware/software update that will integrate these speakers into a full surround. A 5.1 or even a 5.2 would be super.For now I_ extremely happy with them. For the price they_e great.If you_e an idiot looking for super audio file sound or Einstein knowledge for speakers then keep looking. I must say some of the 1 and 2 star reviews I read are, well, idiotic.",0

",26.Dec.19,Yes,"This 3rd gen is an improvement over my 1st gen Echo in terms of sound quality, but is still behind a bit compared to my HomePods in my gym.

Since I started hanging out in my garage again, this Echo keeps me well informed and entertained, if I_ not listening to my news radio station, I_ listening to my favorite crime podcast or listening to smooth jazz.

5,"Great way to enjoy music
  
",27.Dec.19,Yes,"Generally Alexa is fairly good at finding more common music from a more recent era but a bit rusty on years gone by. She might recognize ""Blue Skies"" but not ""Boulevard of Broken Dreams"". She fails at Classical Music as well. I prefer to send her to my Pandora collections because I know what type of music I will get. She does well with Broadway though! Since she is coming into the house by Wi-Fi connection, I wish she could play my music on my Windows 10 computer like she does for Pandora when we set her up. App setup for Windows 10 computers from Amazon does not work and produces errors which technicians do not solve and wish to sell technical services from $150. The Alexa App is free from the Microsoft store, installed by me after I declined their help and my unit works well on all my devices - computers, cell phones, Fire HD's and tablets.",0

2,"Line -In (Aux) does not work yet remains a feature in the description
  
",27.Dec.19,No,"I purchased this Gen 3 speaker yeaterday. I have two others, the Tap and the Original Echo that I am generally pleased with. The Gen 3 was for a special purpose, I needed to connect a wired Audio source to it. After checking the specifications, I see it has a Line-In. Actually, its a Line-In / Line-Out connection configurable in software or supposed to be.After setting up, I proceeded to connect the Line-In (Aux) and opened the Alexa app on my iPhone. I found the Line-In/Line-Out switch and changed it to Line-In. At this point, the app crashed and said something went wrong. It would just refresh the screen not allowing you to toggle the Aux to Line-In. After reading some old reviews, I learned about a problem with the iOS app. So, I had an Android tablet around, I opened the Alexa app on it and found the Line-In switch. Again, I activate it. The app did not crash this time but no audio came out.I contacted Amazon device support who franly did not know what Line-In or Aux was. After 10 minutes of wasted time on chat, the CS person came back with ""That device does not support Line-IN"". I refered him to the current listing which lists Line-In as a feature.The device was returned to the store as Faulty. Today, I purchased an Awsome Ears Boom 2LE from a local brick and mortar store and WOW, what a device. A smart app that works, Line-In that works, sound that is far better than the current echo's, and a useful equalizer to customize the speakers tonal quality. $60.",0

But I wanted something all inclusive. This fits the bill. I_ completely happy with this purchase and I have been telling my family and friends to get one too!,0

1,"I got junk.
  
",27.Dec.19,Yes,This is my 5 Alexa love all of them I think I got a lemon. Speaker makes cracking noise and it's response to my voice is delaved by seconds. My 2 dots and 2 second Gen echos have no problems.,0
5,"Alexa is easy to use.

5,"Works fantastic so far

2,"I think I got a bad one
  
",27.Dec.19,Yes,"We love our echo when it is working properly. The sound is very good. However,  the echo turns off randomly and doesn't respond to commands.  We listen to a lot of audiobooks.  When asking for audiobooks it has a hard time playing books that are in my library.  For example I'll say ""Alexa play magic tree house books 9-16"" it does not recognize the book in audible. But instead play a previous book of the same time that it has played numerous times.  It's very frustrating. I have had to unplug it many times because it skips and does not recognize anything. And I've only had it for maybe 2 months.",0
5,"Knowing Echo speaker and it's features
  
",27.Dec.19,Yes,"What even more kooleer is if you have more than one Alexa echo speaker you can pair them all , create a group for an entire home entertainment audio system. One in the living room, one in the bedroom, one in office room etc. Then apps like Spotify will be able to see the group as and audio output , allow music all over the home. Try it.",0
4,"Great sound, but microphone seems to be lacking.
  
",27.Dec.19,Yes,"While the sound is much better than our Echo Dot, the microphone does not seem to be nearly as sensitive or accurate. You have to talk much closer and louder for the Echo to understand/hear you.",0

5,"Great aid!
  
",28.Dec.19,Yes,I bought three.. one for each room. The basics are great but in an emergency the echo is fantastic.,0
1,"If I was a billionaire, I'd buy the whole world other home speaker products.
  
",28.Dec.19,No,"I can't know what you want this product for, but if you're like me and many of my friends, having it play music (supposedly of your choosing) is a big deal for you. And in that respect, it sucks. I've had more arguments with Alexa about what music it is I'm trying to listen to than I ever imagined possible. And then when it finally (if ever) gets to the type of playlist I'm looking for, the playlist gets so repetitive after a few listens I can predict the songs coming up. It honestly got so bad I pulled out my old 3-CD changer stereo and hooked that up for listening to music while I get ready for work in the morning. You can't tell Alexa to not play certain songs or bands, nor can you go into your Amazon account to request the same (a feature that seems easy to implement, but Amazon certainly hasn't since I mentioned it to them over a year ago). The only credit I can give the echo is it has decent sound, but considering it's lack of functionality and poor AI, I'll stick with an old school home stereo and a music service through my phone.",0
5,"Great device for a mid-sized room
  
",28.Dec.19,Yes,I couldn_ be happier with the Echo. Sound quality was good for the price point of the speaker. Microphone picks up my voice far better than I could have imagined,0
1,"Buggy
  
",28.Dec.19,Yes,"I hope Amazon will have a future fix / update.  I have my speakers paired and run them in stereo.  The set up was easy.  To me, the sound quality is pretty good (I have amateur ears, I_ no sound expert).  But sometimes one speaker will stop playing in the middle of a song and start a new song while the other speaker continues playing the original song.  This happens often.  Then I have to tell Alexa to stop, then start again.  This is annoying.  Especially in a song I like.  I_ hoping because the 3rd generation is new,  this is a bug that will soon be fixed.",0

3,"Red? ... not very!
  
",28.Dec.19,Yes,"I'm pleased with most features of the all new red-edition echo (3rd gen); however, I was disappointed with its color which is more a dusty rose or raspberry rather than crimson. I was expecting (hoping for) something more candy apple or strawberry. Otherwise, I'm satisfied. I think Amazon should replace the muted hue with one more eye-popping.",0
5,"Smart purchase
  
",28.Dec.19,Yes,Is a great smart speaker. Sound is good for such a small size. Still discovering all the things it can do. GREAT PURCHASE.,0
5,"English and Spanish @ the same time, cool!
  
",28.Dec.19,Yes,"It is super cool that you can speak both English and Spanish at the same time to Alexa. I honestly thought that was not possible. This is the feature that I appreciate the most, since it is very useful to me when I am asking Alexa to play Cumbias in Spotify. The sound quality is superb, I have linked my echo to My fire TV stick and now when I I'm watching a movie the sound quality improved tremendously, it did the job as a soundbar. So I could say that you can probably call it a ""smart soundbar"". When I got this gift it included a Smart switch from Kasa and it makes it very easy to turn on and off my room lamp through echo. Overall I can say that I am pretty satisfied with the quality of the sound and the easiness of which Alexa understands both languages.",0

1,"Don'y waste your money
  
",29.Dec.19,Yes,"I just recently bought this device, I've had another one for a few years but I thought something was wrong with it, as looped sounds kept cutting off. Well I am having the same issue with this one. I use it for playing sleep sounds and now it cuts off every few minutes or cuts off all together, the exact same thing that had begun happening with my old device. I did some research and have since found out lots of people have been reporting this problem. It's bad enough Amazon farms their skills out to third party developers who are now trying to get people to pay for them, so you get long annoying ads as well as constant prompts for a 5 star review on your device..... (I've also seen where even if you get a subscription half the time it doesn't work and Amazon does nothing about it) but the looping problem is directly related to Amazon's product as it happens on the old and new devices and also happens when trying to loop music...think next time I will give Google assistant a try, maybe they make their own skills for their own device.",0

5,"LOVE this! The sound quality and volume is impressive!!
  
",29.Dec.19,Yes,"This is my first Echo, before this, I only had Echo dot. The biggest difference is the ability to crank up the volume. The sound quality is great, and LOUD. It's shockingly loud for the small size!There is no downside at all, if you want an Echo for music, this is a GREAT buy in every way! I got it in red, and had to wait a few weeks for it, but I'm glad I did, and would absolutely buy it again.",0
5,"Sounds better then the 2nd generation one!
  
",29.Dec.19,Yes,"This is our second Echo unit since the first one ended up in my 18 years old boy's room after couple of weeks of sitting in the kitchen.  I think the 3rd gen. sounds even better than the previous one was. More bass, more depth to the overall sound. The only thing came right off as a negative impression was the shape. The 2 gen. was a sleek, very stylish piece of electronics that you could easily blend in with your other stuff in any room in the house. The fabric that covered the speakers and the shape of the tower itself gave you more opportunity to place it among anything basically. This one is chubbier and a bit duller. It's not a deal breaker at all, just an observation. I guess the better sound quality means bigger speaker units means increased circumference means chubbier looks. Besides the difference in the aesthetics it is a great product!",0
5,"Awesome product
  
",29.Dec.19,Yes,"This is our second echo, we_e very satisfied with the quality overall.",0
2,"Sound is not much different than echo dot

5,"Added 3rd Echo to home
  
",29.Dec.19,Yes,"We had two of the older models in our house already.  My wife and I tossed around the idea of adding a 3rd to play music from end to end.  Yes, we have a smaller 3 bedroom home and on cyber Monday, we decided to go for the third.  I was impressed by the better quality sound of the 3rd generation Echo.  It has more of a base sound resulting in a fuller spectrum.  I love the idea of asking Alexa to play a song on our group across the house.  We have had no problems syncing or playing on all 3 devices as a group.",0
2,"Not what I expected!
  
",29.Dec.19,Yes,We have a echo dot and I thought this upgrade would be a great Christmas.  I expected the sound to be much better than it is.  From the beginning we have had problems setting it up and it stops playing music a couple times a day.  The ECHO DOT keeps playing on the same internet connection and the ECHO 3rd gen stops.  It may be going back.,0
5,"We love Alexa!
  
",29.Dec.19,Yes,"We love our new Alexa. Especially our kids. It could be because she helps them with their homework. But hey, I'm good with that.",0

5,"Very Happy with the Alexa Echo experience
  
",29.Dec.19,Yes,"We've had a Google assistant for a few years, so to be fair it is an older model. I got the Alexa echo for just listening to music in the master suite. The Alexa Echo has surpassed my expectations. Very happy with the whole Alexa Echo experience.",0

",30.Dec.19,Yes,"3rd generation Echo is a good product.  Set up is very easy compared to my 1st gen Echo.  I do prefer the 1st gen Echo though.  I feel the 1st gen Echo's sound is much better, and I love the changing the volume by spinning the top edge of the 1st gen Echo.  It is much better way to change the volume then asking Alexa to do it or by pressing the 3rd gen Echo's +/- buttons.  But overall I am satisfied with the 3rd gen Echo.",0

",30.Dec.19,Yes,"Alexa is new to us. We couldn_ believe what great sound it gives us and how easy it is to use. Very impressed. So much so - that we got a second echo dot for our kitchen, a larger echo for the living room, an echo show 5 for our bedroom and an echo auto.",0
4,"Help from Alexa
  
",30.Dec.19,Yes,"Alexa was easy to install and the instructions online were very helpful.  I have been using it for music, time,  night sounds, and answering questions.  She can also provide trivia, jokes and weather as well as many other things like giving a recipe step by step.  The echo plays music upon request and can be used to phone people although they did seem to have a little trouble hearing me if I was not close to the echo.  If I needed to get in touch with someone if sick or hurt I could have Alexa make a call for me from another room in my house.",0

3,"Not much difference from first Echo
  
",30.Dec.19,Yes,"As we used our Echo for a lot of our music playlists, we thought the newly designed Echo with what this promised would be much better sound output.  If had to do over, would have just kept first Echo with little difference in sound quality and invested in the Echo Show.",0

",30.Dec.19,Yes,"Don't wish to review, I did the trade in for my echo and it was in perfect condition at time of return however once Amazon received it it was rated non-working and in poor cosmedic condition. This negated the 30$ turn in valuse which subsequently overdrew my account. I called and after a bit they refunded my 30$ but did not and would not cover the overdrawn fee of 25$ the support person said she escalated my issue up a level and I have yet to hear back. Now this 25$ overdraft fee has grown to 50$ very unhappy to say the lease",0

",30.Dec.19,Yes,"I am not a tech type person at all.

I am not all concerned with invasion of privacy much as all things have invaded and negatively impacted our privacy and health- nothing is as it seems, may as well enjoy some perks while getting the shaft.  The sound is great in a space of 500 sq ft., is responsive to my voice but I don't make request like I am talking to a human, there's no kids yelling to it, my house is quiet which may impact how Alexa software responds.  It's a new concept/device and as with most new things, it's not perfect.  And with all man-made things, it never will be.",0

The app that I downloaded on my phone showed an allowed me to listen to what was recorded and there were several recordings where I was not talking to the device. The sound quality was good whenever I play music, but I just think it is 100% important for people to have this device to realize that nothing should be said that you would not say in front of the world. If you don_ have a problem with that then I suggest you get this product. I have to say that it is really cool to be able to turn on and off your lights and other appliances with this device.

The price is lower (Black Friday had a nice discount) and the unit is a bit smaller than the first-generation. I've come to rely on her for timers while cooking, reminders for every day stuff, alarms for those times I need to set a non-standard alarm (catch a plane for example), etc.  I love the lists  I have one for Walmart, groceries, Costco, Sams Club. It makes shopping so much easier to just be able to add X to the grocery list right when you run out.  A must-have to turn on lights in the house. Great to ask ""How old is Actor X"" when you see them in a movie.  The A-Lady has become an important part of the family - glad to be sharing the experience with my daughters.",1

Besides the usual tame uses like playing songs and asking it to tell jokes, it provides a lot of pertinent day to day information like weather and even looking up plane &amp; train schedules.  Also, I have one near my hobby workbench. When working on various projects, it's useful to ask math problems and even used it to compute a few Ohm's Law problems.

",30.Dec.19,No,"Pros: Versatile and when paired with the echo sub is a good alternative to a more expensive sound system.Cons: the line/in feature does not support the subwoofer. You cannot plug a phonograph (or tv) into the echo plus and expect it to engage the subwoofer which is extremely disappointing. If that_ a goal, skip this product pairing.",0
5,"good product at a great price.

2,"Do not buy for Home theater sound!! Not worth it!
  
",30.Dec.19,Yes,"So I ordered two of these echos and 1 sub for 2.1 home theater surround sound. Big fan of amazon products. Very disappointed with the home theater set up and if your buying for that purpose, it_ not worth it. I_ running on 5ghz. There is always an issue. One side it working and the other isn_. Then it swaps, then they both work but the sub is not working. If you watch tv in the early mornings like 5-6am, forget about it. No sound because the devices are unreachable for some reason. Then you have to unpair and pair them again(some devices would still show unreachable. Then you gotta unplug device and plug again). There are set up in my living room where my WiFi is. My point is that it_ not seamless connect, since I got it I_e always been playing around with it to make it stay connected. Gotten to the point where I disconnected it and just hearing sound through my TV. Thinking about returning an echo and sub as I don_ need two echos and I_ not going to have a sub laying around for no reason. Oh and to connect musics, forget about it. The app is horrible for music. I can_ even choose a song from my Apple Music to play. I had to create a playlist for amazon on my Apple app and in the amazon app I can_ even choose the song I want to play or even shuffle the music! This is a complete fail and amazon let me down on this one. The sound on the echo itself is decent.",0

5,"Incredible Value!
  
",30.Dec.19,Yes,"This product is fantastic. For about 6 years I owned a popular mini speaker that rhymes with _ose, _hows and _lows (I think you can figure it out) that cost more than double what the echo costs. As much as I hated the fact that I owned one of these _rand name speaker, it actually sounded impressive for its small size, so impressive that I had it for 6 years. When I was contemplating buying some smart speaker, I was tempted with the Sonos for its sound quality and reputation but the price tag always seemed high. I bought the echo on a whim, as it were, and I_ thoroughly impressed. Not only does it put my old speaker to shame in terms of sound, ease of use and looks, the multi-room music and home-theater configuration options are second to none. After 2 days of owning this speaker, I bought another and bought an echo plus for another room in my house. Don_ get me wrong, it_ still a smaller size speaker and doesn_ have the power of some bigger speaker out there, where you will be blown away is the value of the speaker. I haven_ seen a speaker this small and at this dollar amount perform as well as this speaker. 10/10 would recommended.",0
4,"Needs a better search engine.
  
",30.Dec.19,Yes,This product needs to connected to a better surcharge engine like Google.,0

5,"An Amazing Device!
  
",30.Dec.19,Yes,"This was my 1st time purchase of an Amazon Echo device. So far I like everything about it. It is so amazing that it will play any genre , or even artist that I ask for. t gives me the weather so fast. I like the options of turning off  some of the features that I am leery about, such as ordering items thru Alexa. Maybe sometime I may be more comfortable doing this, but for now it's turned off. It is really nice hearing another person's voice.  I like this device so well that I ordered 2 echo dots. One for my bedroom and one for the kitchen, as well as 2 Amazon smart plugs for Alexa to turn on and off lights.",0

5,"Great product!
  
",30.Dec.19,Yes,"We started out with an echo dot that we got free with our cable tv service. We loved it but it was so small we couldn_ hear it WEP so we decided to upgrade. This did not disappoint! The volume is amazing and Alexas voice is clear. Also, can hear me from across the house asking her questions etc. which is a definite bonus. Better than my iPhone and Siri who half the time doesn_ hear me and/or doesn_ answer my questions but instead tells me to open a webpage she found. Alexa has yet to tell me she doesn_ know the answer to something! Definitely worth the money.",0

",31.Dec.19,Yes,"I am glad that it was purchased during a Black Friday Sale,  making it more affordable. However, having listened to music through so many, othwr, older models, much taller(larger?) Echo(s) , Ive been  expecting at least the same high-quality sound, if not better,  with an upgraded 2019, model.  is it me ir does size count?  Being at least  1/3  shorter than Echos I listen to elsewhere, on a regular basis, HOLD-UP, WAIT: Apologies for typis I cannot control nor change, thanks to yhis Refurbed 2017 Fire Tablet 10 sent last Oct. 2019, replacing the defective, albeit brand- new- identical model (a Regift from friend in  Jan. 2019).  Back to the topic, i am not very impressed, therefore, unsure of our futurevtogether. This is  my first, Echo and so far: Alexis has been  unable to find most of the songs I requested, some genres escape her (Gospel). The sound is over- Bassy,  tinny Treble,  I akready own a larger size Bose System in living room.  This is on 2nd Fl. in Office/Den.  I expected more sound, less failed Alexis, .I'll need to find more electrical outlets. For some reason, I believed that this upgraded model would be wireless (my fault and not a deal- breaker).  Being an audiophile , if its not wowing me, not keeping more electronics around attracting more electric dust.  The good news is that no one is evesdropping, not hacked, yet, simply bc it will not  function on any power strip not even our new, free,  eversource/Nstar Advanced Power Strip, unless plugged into a Hot/Control Socket.  Huh.Control mode? Nope, notgunnahappen.  Only if there is a chance I'll be visited by Angels singing tge Winning Lottery Numbers, not inviting ""Santa Clause, your new  best friend"" into our areana. .",1

",31.Dec.19,Yes,"I bought this on black Friday due to my Echo V. 1 broke . I do not recall seeing the stats on v.3 but what a surprise when I plugged it in. In addition to working flawlessly, the music quality is much better, especially with my Amazons UHD music subscription. Nice bass for such a small attractive Echo.

",31.Dec.19,Yes,"I purchased this Echo because I wanted to pair it with the one I already had. I looked everywhere to be sure that the 2 would pair before purchasing. I was not able to locate that information anywhere so purchased anyway. Found out upon arrival it would not pair with the one I've had for 2 years. How many ""generations"" have come out in that amount of time!I paid $159 for my original Echo and $59 for this upgraded one. Actually, I think the sound quality is better on my original!",0

4,"Hey Alexa

5,"The sound quality is real nice
  
",31.Dec.19,Yes,Really good,0
4,"Great sound but be prepared for a learning curve on how to command your Echo!
  
",31.Dec.19,Yes,"Received my echo 3rd Gen unit over the holidays due to an ongoing promotion. It has great sound over the Dot version hands down - good base and highs. It takes a bit of investment of your time to learn all the nuances of what Alexa can do for you. With the app, you can set up your Echo to be an alarm clock, timer, grocery list, teach it a routine for each day (like giving the weather forecast, the latest news from a specific news source, turn on/turn off lights, thermostat control, play specific music (classical, rock, pop) etc.). But beware, the instructions for all this are not included with your Echo. You have to dig around (through e-books, YouTube, etc.) to become familiar with the commands and required outcomes. For example, my unit began to display a pulsating yellow light that became annoying at night in my bedroom. I couldn_ turn it off except by disconnecting the power. Of course, this could_e become a deal breaker if I had to disconnect every nite (I kept all the shipping package just in case I needed to return it). Well, it turned out that this was one way the Echo communicates with you. It was trying to tell me It had a notification for me to listen to. Until I asked, _lexa, do I have any notification? the yellow pulsating light would_e continued. Immediately after delivering all notifications, the yellow pulsating light stopped. By the way, the notifications were about shipping/delivery of packages coming from, wait for it...Amazon. Of course, other types of notifications are possible pending how you program your Echo. Like I said, this simple issue would_e been a deal breaker for me if I hadn_ decided to invest some of my time in trying to resolve this simple problem. It wasn_ until I learned how to communicate with my Echo that the problem wouldn_ go away. But again, the answer was not included with this product. My feedback to Amazon would be to include a list of commands and a trouble shooting section for the buyer. By employing this one simple act, I_ sure these products would be in far more demand by their customers once they learn the how to_ of communicating with these aliens. Beginning to love my Echo!",0

Hopefully software updates will continue to improve performance in that area.",0

The speakers surprised me on how much Bass and how good it would play the high's and lo's so, I had to order another Echo lol so I can pair them on my desk &amp; use them as Computer Speakers or just have them for a surround sound and stereo system.

The Echo had wonderful sound and we enjoy finding new skills that are useful and fun. Yes not all skills work well but you can always disable skills that don't work well for you or end up not being what you expected. Alexa is always learning new things and it is fun to figure out what new features and skills are coming up to add onto what you already enjoy about Alexa. My daughter and I also really enjoy using the drop in feature so we can call each other from different floors in the house.,0

",1.Jan.20,Yes,"Para mi uso personal, muy bueno un producto de excelente calidad, pero mi recomendaci칩n es que deber칤an tener en youtube un video en espa침ol para que expliquen que se puede hacer con Alexa o cuales son las funciones que se le puede pedir por ejemplo yo compr칠 adicional dos Fire Stick y me aparecen en el app de Alexa los dos con mi nombre y no se como aparecieron all칤 y que puedo hacer con ellos con Alexa, por eso hablo de un video explicativo, o que tiene que ver Alexa con los Fire Stick.",0

",1.Jan.20,Yes,"Quality manufacture &amp; features; simple, speedy set-up; the sound is great.  Love it and so do house guests that hear it.",0
5,"Worth every penny
  
",1.Jan.20,Yes,Really like my echo 3rd Generation smart speakerIt says that it does not support Bluetooth However It Does support Bluetooth because I am able to pair it with my phone and play music from my phone on it.  If you have an old echo or tap as long as it is in good shape you can probably trade it in thru Amazon.,0
5,"Love the voice recognition
  
",1.Jan.20,Yes,So much better than Siri at understanding voice requests,0
4,"Slight droning noise
  
",1.Jan.20,Yes,"Sometimes cannot hear you when music is playing. Also had to unplug and let sit for a few minutes because the speakers were making a substantial droning noise, has not occurred since.",0

5,"The sound is crisp clear and fantastic!!

3,"Alright but not the best
  
",1.Jan.20,Yes,"The sound quality when compared side by side with the smaller 3rd generation speaker was not abundantly noticeable.  Sure it can play a little louder and offers a little more dynamic range, but not an additional $50 worth.  It is also annoying that you have to have two of the same speaker to put into stero mode versus allowing you to use two different speakers.",0
5,"Solid sound.
  
",1.Jan.20,Yes,The sound was better than I expected,0
3,"I wouldn_ recommend this product just yet due to it shutting down frequently.
  
",1.Jan.20,Yes,The verdict is still out on this Smart Speaker!  I love to listen to music on it and it cuts in and out.  I don_ think it is my wifi.  When it cuts out I ask Alexa to play the radio station again.  My music comes back on and the process is repeated.  I like sound that comes through on the speaker.  My first Alexa only lasted 8 months and the sound was awful.  This 2nd time I bought a better quality Alexa.  Hopefully it will last longer.  Thank you!,0

",1.Jan.20,Yes,This is my first Echo device and am happy about its performance. Setup is easy. Voice recognition and sound quality are good.,0
1,"Not what I thought
  
",1.Jan.20,Yes,This is not a good speaker. It has to stay plugged up at all times not a traveling speaker. I travel a lot and can_ use it in hotels or on public WiFi. Also has to be connected to WiFi at all times is another bummer. Not happy I brought 7 for gifts,0
5,"Well worth the money
  
",1.Jan.20,Yes,This was a gift to my friend Debbie and as far as know she is happy with it.,0
5,"Upgrade from Echo Dot - Large Room

",1.Jan.20,Yes,Very awesome speaker. It's a great alarm clock and the quality is amazing.  Play songs with a simple command. I love it and so will you.,0
1,"Not good with Spotify!
  
",1.Jan.20,Yes,"Very difficult to connect to Spotify premium. It will only work on Bluetooth but then Alexa won_ work. Change default to play Spotify and still playing amazon music. If I ask Alexa to play Spotify, it plays free Spotify, and not premium account. You can_ change Spotify music in the Alexa app, only Amazon music. I purchased google home instead and much more satisfied. This Alexa is a waste of money. Wish I could leave less than one star.",0

",1.Jan.20,Yes,When you live a long way from a radio station it is hard to get a solid and consistent signal. The station I like is available on Alexa and it works great that way.  The sound is better than the old radio and I enjoy this device.,0

3,"Disappointing
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,I _pgraded from a 2nd gen and I_ about to go back to it. Sound quality was so much better on the 2nd gen.,0
5,"much better than gen 1 echo
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,"I actually like the gen 1 tower's looks, but this short echo in a light blue cloak is cuter. the clincher was the 3mm line in/out port which offers a myriad of flexibility. the sound is quite good - even too loud at max. I do have one suggestion and that is to offer a real amplified out rather than line out, so I can drive an external pair of non-amplified speakers. this would require speaker hookups, so I don't imagine this suggestion would be taken up.",0
5,"Dementia and Alzhermer_ Disease
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,"I am almost totally satisfied with this device. I use it daily and frequently to help me get through the day. I have recently had to put my wife in a memory care facility, because she has dementia. I had hoped she could use the device, but it_ too complicated for her in her condition. She has no short-term memory at this time, and still can_ remember how to operate the device. Also, the change in volume level as music is played, frustrates her. At one moment it is too soft, at the next it is too loud. Too bad it doesn_ have AVC, Automatic volume control such as we have on radios.",0
5,"Gift for my daughter
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,"I bought this as a gift for my daughter, she was hesitant initially; said she didn't think she would even use it.  She loves it and uses it mostly for the Amazon music library.  This Echo 3rg generation has excellent sound.",0

3,"HOW TO MAKE IT STOP ..WHAT EVER IT IS DOING
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,"I DISLIKE THAT I DO NOT KNOW WHT TO SAY TO STOP THINGS LIKE MUSIC,  BOOK READING, IT SHOULD COME WITH BASIC COMMANDS.  ITS  GREAT  BUT FOR THAT.",0
5,"Amazing Amazon
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,I do like the speak. The sound is amazing. I wish Alexa was a little more interactive and spontaneous. Very knowledgeable and helpful device.,0

5,"Echo (3rd Gen)
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,I got this to replace echo (2nd Gen) . I  have to say the sound is an upgrade and it is more versatile with what it can do.,0
5,"She has gotten even better !!
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,"I had one of the very 1st Echo's, but it did not survive my granddaughter's oops this Christmas. Bought the new one and it's even better !!  The sound quality is great, and the continued new things Alexa can do is also great. She is almost kinda part of the family, as we call her name numerous times every day.",0
3,"The sound goes in and out.
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,"I hate that I have to unplug it, then plug it back in Repeatedly so I can get the static sound of the speaker",0
5,"Music and More
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,I have 2 of the first Echos and 3 echo dots and needed 1 more for a room that did not have one. My Wife needed it so that room would have music when she wanted it Merry Christmas to my wife. And she loves it,0
4,"Good sound
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,I have an older model at my other home and the sound seems a bit better?  Really like this one though and with Dots in the bedrooms it will be a useful tool!!,0
4,"I enjoy it....but it needs a little tweaking.
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,I have asked for specic music from artist........cd by artist and it won't play that will shuffle every song by artist.,0
5,"Worth the money.
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,I have this in my living room and it's used primarily for music. Great sound. Was hoping for a little more bass but still wonderful. Love all the different skills. Wouldn't be without it now.,0

",2.Jan.20,Yes,I love my Alexa!!!!!,0
5,"So happy with this purchase!!
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,I love the new design and sound quality,0
2,"not perfected yet
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,I love the way the alexa 3 gen sounds but it is still lacking in a lot of ways.. especially when it comes to setting up light bulbs.  I bought 2 different kind including the one that was part of the package put together by amazon and I couldn't get them to hook up at all. My neighbor next door had the same problem but he broke down and bought a hub so the worked thru that not the alexa itself.  I had no trouble with the outlets.  Problem with that is if the wifi goes out you have to climb behind your furniture to unplug your outlets to be able to use what ever you had plugged into them..Remember if you have wifi that goes out you don't want everything to be a smart device thru the alexa.  Alexa does not work for anything if the wifi goes out.As I said earlier the sound quality of music is really great. Volume is really good as well. It goes about as loud as a person could want.I also attempted using amazons templates for making a skill. They need to work on their templates a a couple of them were not working properly to be able to share what you taught it to make.. Shame I had really high hopes for this device.,0
5,"Love this!  Great sound!  Awesome!
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,"I love this speaker! Great sound!  Lots of music!  Haven_ used it to perform other things like smart plugs, etc.",0

5,"Just ask Alexa a question and she will answer very quickly.
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,"I never had one before so this one seemed very good to me. I am amazed at how smart, quick, and accurately Alexa answers my questions or does what I tell her to do.Daniel Moore",0
3,"Nice but not what I was looking for
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,I ordered 2 Echo's to use as wireless speakers in my retail showroom and ended up switching to JBL Flip instead. The sound quality on the Echo doesn't compare to the Flip and while I enjoy the voice recognition features when purchasing speakers sound quality is the most important.Sound on the Echo is good and works well in small rooms but it just doesn't compare.,0
5,"I love Alexa!!
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,I play all my music. Whatever my mood is.,0
5,"The Echo
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,"I really enjoy the Echo. At first, I was a little confused about how to set it up on my phone, but was quickly able to figure it out. I was able to set up my Spotify (must be a Premium member), Amazon music, and I Heart Radio pretty easily. Echo recognizes voice command very well. I rarely have to repeat myself. Also, the sound is pretty nice. I have it set up in my kitchen and I can hear it all throughout my apartment. I would recommend this product.",0
5,"Upgraded from Echo-Dot to this.
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,I stream music from Amazon Music and listen to Sirius-XM and love it.,0

4,"Sky high expectations not met but still pleased
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,It's clear that the product has evolved since the original echo I purchased way way way way back when. However I I do feel like the speakers are not quite the same quality individually that they used to be. I have seen stereo pairs with the subwoofers sound amazing at what really is a good price for a 2.1 home audio system but I had higher expectations of the individual unit.,0
4,"Good to use
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,It's easy to use and good information.,0
5,"Great product
  
",2.Jan.20,Yes,"Just love Alexa products.  This is the THIRD Alexa in this home and one Echo Dot too.  The Dot is OK, but no match for sound quality from these Echo devices.  Bought two LED bulbs for the front room, they were a pain to install from that company, but they got us through it and Echo turns on/off and dims the lamps on command.  All devices also tell us if someone is @ the front door.",0

Since we already have an Echo, I really thought about saving some money and returning ours. I_ so glad we didn_! We just plugged it in yesterday and wow! The sound is just so much better! It_ beautiful! Also have to say that I love the blue color as well. For some reason, we didn_ even have to go into the Alexa app to connect this.

I have 2 one upstairs in my bedroom and one in kitchen.  I ask to listen to my audio book while getting ready for work and then when I go downstairs to make coffee, I can continue there.  I also used it for announcements (come to dinner) and to play music during the holiday season.  Definitely recommend!!!",0

Can make some adjustments to sound with equalizer on app.  Cons: 1-volume slider on app disappeared, so I have to either ask Alexa to lower the volume of the echo plus or manually adjust the volume. 2- can't listen to movies with two paired echo plus devices. You can only use one speaker when playing videos or watching movies.",0

She's been using her phone and our TV up to this point for her music needs and the sound quality is just not there. This speaker allows her to be able to use Bluetooth, Aux. port, or Amazon Music. I purchased this speaker instead of a normal Bluetooth speaker for the ""Smart"" features of it. I got the Echo instead of the Dot for the Woofer (bass) for music. Our whole family loves talking to Alexa, and we can also use the smart feature of Alexa for other things than just music. I would say, so far, we are extremely happy with this purchase.",0
2,"No battery = no fun.
  
",3.Jan.20,Yes,"I had an earlier Alexa product that I loved.  Once it was uncharged I could unplug it and carry it around the house with me.  I used it for music and news, mostly, as well as occasional info queries.  I am disappointed with this new Echo.  It has much better sound quality than the old one.  But it is bulky and heavy and does not have a battery.  So I find myself rarely using it.  When I do unplug it and carry it to a new outlet, it takes too long to charge up and become responsive.  I will need to get a battery attachment, but that will only add more bulk &amp; weight -- and cost!",0

If you are up grading, there no need to type in your network info. Because your info is already in your account  The Echo tech that helped me was very patient and worked with me for over 2hrs. He went above and beyond. We tried every situation to hook the 1st Gen to the different groups of speakers. Firgured that there was something wrong with it. Or, it was getting to old.3rd Gen sounds even better than the original ECHO",0

",3.Jan.20,Yes,"I've been a echo owner since the 1st gen... this thing is garbage compared to the 1st gen. Yes, sound quality is way better but it crackles and pops when waking her. It sounds broken, flat out. Tech support says this is normal. Nope, 1st gen did not do this garbage. That's not even the worst part. I use my echos as my preliminary music listening devices. I pay a premium for unlimited and HD music from Amaxon. Both of the latest gen echos I bought randomly disconnect ALL THE TIME and randomly stop playing music for no reason. They're supposed to be new tech, but honestly the 1st gen worked way more flawlessly. Major bugs and kinks that I have zero faith in Amazon addressing before they shove the newest gen dow your throat.",0
5,"Very happy with it. Good sound quality.
  
",3.Jan.20,Yes,"I've had an echo dot (2nd gen) for awhile, so I was already accustom to interfacing with Alexa.  I used the dot primarily as a music player, and had it plugged in to a boombox-type of unit to improve the sound quality.  After reading about the Echo smart speaker's sound quality, I decided to give it a try.  I was immediately very pleased with the sound quality, and after doing a side-by-side comparison with the echo-dot-and-boombox arrangement, the new Echo smart speaker quickly replaced my former setup.  It has surprisingly good bass performance, considering its size, and reminds me of the sound quality of what I would call a ""table radio"" (for those old enough to remember such things).  All in all, I am very happy with this item.",0

Not at all intuitive, user friendly, or fun to operate. I'm considering returning the echo for a google home.

",4.Jan.20,Yes,"Aside from all the things the Echo is able to do, we purchased this device for my daughter who is a high school dance major. She has to practice her choreography a lot and is constantly having to stop and go over to her phone to replay or rewind her music. Being able to speak to Alexa and have her pause or rewind a song however many seconds needed has been really helpful to my daughter. It allows her to focus more on her dance without losing momentum or focus. The sound quality is excellent. We have enjoyed using the Echo, as well, for all the other added conveniences a smart device brings to the home and I can see us purchasing a few more in the future.",0

Has Amazon tech help twice. They did it play continuously .They werepacked with a small amount of  of plastic that was blowed up like small plastic bags. I think they should have used styrofoam to protect the speakers  , they were probably throughed around doing shipping and caused something to come a loose. The only thing I noticed is they would no play continuously. Very disappointed.",0

",4.Jan.20,Yes,"I mostly use this product for listening to music. It's worked for me thus far and adding songs to my playlist is convenient. I'm just a little concerned about the ""always on"" microphone. Seems like it could easily be used as a wiretap, and judging from some articles, that is a major concern for this product. I'm definitely uneasy about it keeping a record of anything I say, and while the policy claims it's not spying on customers, it's difficult to know if that's legitimately true or just a claim to avoid potential lawsuits.",1

It sure is loud though which is great.  You can naturally talk to it using phrases like _k enough when you want to stop an action.  You don_ have to talk to it like it_ a robot and worry about saying the _ight commands.  It understands you and just works.  I_e bought 5 of them in the past week lol, and the studio is on its way tomorrow.  It also works flawlessly with the smart device in my home",0

3,"First generation is definitely more Superior than this 3rd generation
  
",4.Jan.20,Yes,this version is not comfortable to the first generation. First of all the  bass sound is adjusted to take over and often times it causes discomfort to listen to even when the bass is adjusted to the lowest available level . The voice recognition is also less Superior than the first generation. It often has Hang Ups and a red circle indicating its inability to respond to a question or at a speed at which comprable to the first generation Alexa. We had the worst time connecting it to our Wi-Fi this time. Overall we are not pleased with the change in the base which causes literally the floor to vibrate even said at the lowest level. This takes away from the actual music that's being played and we have to adjust the volume down just so we can have less Bass which compromises the listening experience. I find this Alexa to not be an improvement to the first-generation and I wish I could buy another first-generation which broke recently.  I I am very disappointed in this new generation  which I was looking forward to and thought would be even a greater version from the first generation. If it weren't for the fact that Alexa Can Read Wikipedia entries I would have purchased my personal assistant from another company.,0

I complained but the first call said it didn't say it  but then I looked at my history and yes it did say free music for 4 months but I didn't check it so they wouldn't give it to me. I think they should have anyway.,0

That was easy and Amazon gets a 6 star for their help. The unit seems to get lost and forgets what is supposed to be doing. Things like playing more than one song by the artist. We mainly purchased this to play music throughout our home and was unaware there was a limit to _ow many echos connected together. As we purchased a package of 3 echos and a sub. The limit is said to be three, leaving us with a _ouge echo. Still nice and for the money the sound is great for us. All in all it_ a good product we may just need to know better.",0

It_ pretty loud, and Alexa can hear me from distances I thought she wouldn_ be able to. I also really like the mute mic button! I don_ like that you have to pay for music apps if you want to play certain songs, but I knew that before I bought it. Of course that_ not Alexas fault either.",0

",5.Jan.20,Yes,wasted a lot of money buying 2 echos and a subwoofer that don't play on music unlimited plan unless you pay for the multiple device plan even though your only listening to one song in one place . i think it would be nice if amazon told you that before you bought it. i make a lot of purchases from them every year and am a prime member as well i might start to look elsewhere for my shopping needs. very disappointed would really think twice about wasting your money on this set. would not recommend. amazon support was no help either.,0

",5.Jan.20,Yes,"What I dislike like and maybe someone can answer this - I can call out on Alexa to my contacts and talk to them however, I can not answer in coming calls from my contacts on Alexa.  She states ""no incoming call"" even though my phone is ringing.  I do like having the ability to listen to music, weather etc. without pulling out my phone or having the TV on.  I would recommend this product highly.",0
3,"unreliable
  
",5.Jan.20,Yes,"When I first got this item as a gift, I thought it was really cool.  A few days later, Alexa did not respond to my voice at all.  The lights came on but shut off immediately after I asked her to play some music.  Last night, I asked her to play a specific artist.  She stated that she could not unless I pay, but she could play something similar.  The entire hour she played something similar, the music was static, and came in and out.  Have called my son several times since he gave me the item as a gift.  He said he didn't know why the item would be acting up.  No longer amused by this item.",0

4,"First one inexplicably failed
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,"Amazon keeps hassling for a right up, so here's some truth.  The Amazon products seem to be VERY VERY cheaply made and burn themselves out, just after the first year.  If you grow dependent on them, you'll have to continually replace them at your cost.  Solid State electronics should not burn themselves out, they should last years not months!  A decently manufactured product should last for years, but these devises are not that.  If Amazon wants my opinion, I would say they should build better quality products!!!The new replacement seems to wax in it's ears and it frequently takes longer to preform simple tasks like turning on the lights.  Sure it wasn't as expensive as the first one I bought, but I am very unlikely to keep buying units because the burn themselves out.  !@#$% the shareholders!  Amazon seem to make huge amounts of money and I am unhappy they are going down this path where users need to replace their garbage every year or two.Hey all you ""Green"" people out there, certainly lousy corporate strategies that rob from the customer and and are horribly just filling up landfills is a really bad strategy, particularly at the scale Amazon sales are.  If you represent a Green charity or concern, maybe your organization can attack Amazon and have them create a decent product instead of robbing from their customers having to continually buy replacements.  Besides the low down despicable ethics, it seems really bad for our environment.  Cheap lousy products are waste of time, money, and our planet's limited resources, but I'm sure some near looser at Amazon got a raise for developing a product that burns it's self out after a few months.  But the rest of the world should prosecute them for the waste it is.  Anyways, Amazon keeps sending me emails like they think I would like their product.  Quite the contrary, I find their practice of designing these horrible products to burn themselves out is utterly despicable and a huge loss for our fragile environment.",0

If regularly unplugging and restarting your device isn't a problem for you then it's a great product.

The Sub Woofer adds a lot more sound, and makes the system fill the room with music. I put an Echo with the Sub, in our living room area, and I was so impressed with the sound quality, that I'm now going to add an Echo and Sub, to our dining room area, and the master bedroom.",0

2,"Poor WiFi performance compared to Echo dot
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,"I got this Echo to replace an Echo Dot &amp; get the improved sound quality.The sound quality is indeed excellent.  The Alexa integration works just fine, and the voice quality &amp; recognition are excellent.  What's not to love?Well, the problem is poor WiFi performance.  I give it 5 stars for voice, integration and sound.  However, the WiFir performance - an absolutely critical element - is poor at best.  One star for that.I have reset the device several times, moved it around the room, and done everything I can but it just has poor WiFi.  The Echo Dot I replaced could stay connected and stream literally all day long without hitch in exactly the same spot with the same WiFi. This unit, on the same WiFi, the same day, could not stream for 5 minutes before skipping and losing connection on any of several tests.As a final test, I connected it to a WiFi unit in the same room. No problem - it works beautifully if it is literally in the same room as the 802.11 device. That's not practical.I am a huge fan of Alexa &amp; the Echo's (sounds like an 80's band name) but this Echo hits a sour note.  I don't know if it is firmware or the chip set that is poor, but it's just not up to Amazon's previous device standards.",0
5,"This speaker is great!
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,"I have a Dot in nearly every room, many of them grouped for stereo and an Echo Sub. As this new Echo (3rd gen) was released, I got excited by learning the previous version, the Echo Plus, was compatible to group for stereo. So I purchased this and another Echo Sub and set it up in what we call our yoga room. It_ been great and I find myself just sitting in the room to listen to music. All that said, the Alexa service isn_ perfect yet. She has moments of inoperability and it_ super annoying when Alexa doesn_ hear you correctly or just stops playing altogether. But that is a different issue than the hardware. This speaker is great and I recommend it. (Note: This speaker does not have the hub feature, so get the Echo Plus if that_ what you require.)",0
4,"Not as seamless as my echo dot.
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,I have an echo dot in my bedroom. It wakes great. Functions great. I bought this echo and it just seems a bit slower and doesn't wake up when I speak.  I almost sent it back but I'm waiting to see if it gets any better.  Overall does the job.,0

",6.Jan.20,Yes,"I'm an Amazon/Alexa fan boy. I'll admit it and while these devices, I believe, generation after generation keep looking better and better, I don't see the feature set/sound getting significantly better than previous devices. Just my personal opinion, and I still have dots all thru the house, just don't see the need yet to pay the extra money for the full size version",0

",6.Jan.20,Yes,"I'm still learning new things that add positive to my life with the Echo.  I wish it knew more ... ie, I want to ask questions as if I'm asking Google and get answers.  Rarely gets me the correct answers or understands the questions.  That's why it doesn't get 5 stars.  Love it so far!",0
5,"Instant music on a whim
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,"I've actually used my device almost exclusively for music, the feature that attracted me to it.  I really appreciate being able to summon up a group or artist in my mind and almost instantly be listening to his/her/their songs.  Alexa has also answered a few questions about weather, store hours, and such.  She's pretty convenient, I must admit, even though I was reluctant to have her in my home.",0

5,"Amazon 3rd Generation Echo Review
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,Several of my friends have been encouraging me to bring Alexa into my home for a some time now.  With the great prices being offered on Black Friday I decided to purchase an Echo 3rd Generation device.  It was extremely easy to register with the Alexa app and integrate it with my home WiFi.I also bought 2 Amazon Receptacles to control table lamps in rooms of my home.  There_ a lot of things you can do with Alexa and I_ learning a lot of new tricks these days.,0
3,"Over all it_ ok not worth the price though since it doesn_ really do what it_ supposed to
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,She never uses the in app skills that I want her to use it_ like she has no idea what I_ saying when I ask her to play sleep sounds or ask her to choose who_ turn it is. Other than that she_ helpful for setting timers or telling a joke,0

",6.Jan.20,Yes,Sound quality is most excellent.,0
5,"Nice upgrade from original Echo
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,Sound quality is much better. The form factor is more attractive . All the great functionality with more features added daily is great. Pair this device with AnyList for keeping lists for groceries and tasks across all your Apple devices,0

5,"A helping hand when u need it.
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,Still figuring it out loving it so far works great with my smart bulbs ect :),0
5,"Good...Works Well
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,The Echo (3rd gen) has very good sound and good voice recognition.,0
4,"Echo Gen 1 vs Gen 2
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,"The new Echo seems to do everything as well as my Gen 1 unit, but the new speakers provide deeper bass.The one difference I didn_ see as an improvement was that changing the volume manually on the new unit is done by pressing a + or - button instead of turning the rotating ring used on the Gen 1. Using these buttons, especially in the dark, is a hit or miss proposition, especially since there are 4 of them, all the same size, so no way to distinguish by feel. The ring was not only more intuitive, but I always got the desired result. I know that volume can be adjusted by voice, but then you can_ hear the program material as Alexa changes the volume. This is a minor complaint, more of an observation.One thing I really like is being able to synchronize playback on both units. I will probably add a third unit to get music (or whatever) playing throughout the house.",0
4,"I love it and it has great sound
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,The only thing I don't like is it just shuts down or won't start.,0
3,"Echo
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,The sound is Ok but not great,0
5,"Easy set up w/Amazon pre-configured
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,"The sound quality is noticeably better than the Echo Dot. It was very easy to set up as it was shipped pre-configured for my account. Very much a plug and play device. The downloadable app is worth adding to a smartphone as it allows for additional configuration and tools for smart home. Placed the Echo in my bedroom to help with morning and evening routines. It is my first Echo device and have found the convenience of the functions to be both good utility and fun technology to use. Set up a routine to turn out the lights, say the weather forecast for the morning commute, and play music to fall asleep to. Then another routine to wake up to an alarm, turn on the light at 50% brightness, say the current weather and traffic, a daily briefing of selected news, then play motivational music to wake up. Makes it harder surf the snooze buttons on the alarm clocks. The utility is much more than just a speaker. No issues with shipping or the device.",0
4,"Probably not the best but definitely good.
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,"The speaker is amazing, that was the number one reason why I bought it.However the voice recognition is pretty poor, she always mistaken_ my voice with my brothers voice while my brothers google speaker never had that problem.Alexa can also be stupid SOMETIMES, like not putting the right song on when asked.Overall I enjoy it, definitely worth buying.",0
4,"Does not work with sub woofer
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,The speaker works well. What was not clear to me (could very well be my fault!) is that it doesn't work with the subwoofer (echo) that I bought and you can only pair 2. I thought I could have several and music through out my house but that isn't the case. I have 2 of the echo 3rd gens in Master bedroom and then 2 dots working with sub woofer. They all work well but this was a draw back that I feel Amazon does not go out of it's way to make clear.,0
5,"Very good
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,"This Alexa has very good sound quality, and the pairing was very simple. I would recommend buying one or two.",0

",6.Jan.20,Yes,"Voice recognition is a joke!  I thought voice recognition meant it would only respond to my voice.  I_ the only one out of 6 people in my house that did the voice recognition, but Alexa responds to everybody!  Even company coming in off the street!  And my four year old granddaughter, who calls it _oleska!Everything else about this speaker is awesome!",0
3,"Unhappy
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,Volume goes up &amp; down without doing anything to the Echo. One time it is so low you can barely hear Alexa and the next time it is loud.  Trying to decide if we should return it.,0

4,"Fairly Decent Upgrade From Gen 1 - But not quite their.
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,"We originally purchased a first generation Alexa when they came out. It is a great device that we still use in another part of the house now that we have this newer generation version. Aside from it being a little shorter and more stout, it's otherwise no different whatsoever from the first generation. The one exception to that is the sound. The bass is just slightly better on the new device, but not a lot to make an impact. Sound is still dull, with no defining highs or lows, just more a blaring mid range sound. If they can fix this or offer a device with much better audio, we'd get that. Is it with the money to upgrade from a Gen1? I'd say no, not yet.",0
4,"Great product - Great value
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,Well so far so good we really like it -we have another one and we really like the idea that we can play one or the other or both,0
3,"hummm, how to say
  
",6.Jan.20,Yes,"Well, it's just sort of creepy, in a way. I like it because I can ask for weather info, order up music..that IS fun.

",7.Jan.20,Yes,"Absolutely love this when it_ working properly! It has great sound when working but there are sometimes volume issues (Music volume is almost silent when all the way turned up but then Alexa voice is extremely loud) . I_e also had issues with the lights on the Alexa. They consistently stay on even when I_ not talking to her and also when there are no notifications. After leaving unplugged for a few hours it comes back on and works fine, I just wish I didn_ have to keep resetting it. It will sometimes go a day or more without working properly.",0

1,"Complete junk. Unresponsive. Stick with the 2nd generation
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,"Before I write my review let me say that I install over 300 Amazon echos every year for my company in brand new homes. I even own 9 Amazon echos in my own home and vehicle.Prior to using this Amazon Echo 3rd generation I had Amazon Echo 2nd generation speakers in my living room set up as a theater system group. They worked great! Each Echo had a different wake up work so I can speak to that particular Amazon Echo. One Amazon Echo was set up as left speaker and one was set up as right speaker. I decided to upgrade my Amazon echos to the 3rd Generation Amazon Echo. After setting them up the same way I had my 2nd generation setup I can tell you that I am completely dissatisfied. although these speakers works great in a theater group when watching TV, use the wake up word Alexa to call my right Amazon Echo the light ring will respond but the echo with the Wake word Echo response verbally instead. If I remove the Amazon echos from the theater group The correct Echo will respond. I contacted technical support and they are completely clueless. I then decided to test out my whole house group that I use quite often to play my music in every room. Most of the time my speakers don't respond at all and they don't play music. if they do respond , only 1 Amazon Echo plays the music even though these Amazon echos are in the same group that I asked to play. When I tried to tell them to stop , they acknowledge me speaking to them but do not stop playing the music. It became extremely frustrating to the point where I was yelling at my echo With no response. Amazon really needs to go back to the drawing board on this 3rd generation and fix their bugs.",0
5,"Couldn't be happier!
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,Best Christmas gift I've gotten in years!.  Love the convenience of finding information.  Especially like listening to music.  Never expected the great sound quality.  Like the responsiveness to my voice even at a distance.  Will definitely purchase as gift for others.,0

",7.Jan.20,Yes,"I got Alexa for radio, pod casts, and the occasional song. Audio is clear and loud with a smaller foot print than the radio/computer. Simply tell Alexa the station ID, and it will change stations.  Before I bought this device, I verified it would work with Windows 7, since it must be connected to a wireless modem using your home computer. (I do not have an i-phone.) When I tried to download the Alexa application software, the download would not finish due to my inadequate web security software. I had to purchase web security software and the help desk cleaned my disk of files I didn't even know I had. My machine runs much faster and Alexa works great. The help desk was very helpful and answered any question/concern I had.  Maybe if I had Apple based computer at home or an i-phone this wouldn't have been a problem??",0

",7.Jan.20,Yes,"I love the Alexa. We bought it for my 10 year old daughter. We like the sound so much, we are planning on getting a couple more.",0

5,"It_ something everyone should have !!!
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,I love this item it so nice to tell it a song to play and it plays it. Also when you wake up you can say Alexa what_ today_ news and it starts playing the news when you set it up you can tell it which news station you want to here. You can always ask it what the weather is going to be today and for the rest of the week. There are to many things that it does to write about.,0
4,"Awesome
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,I love this product,0
5,"Great purchase for this price! Makes life easy!
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,"I love using Alexa for music and weather. Although there is a lot more I can do, I enjoy verbally requs music/weather/news/etc as oppose to walking over and putting something on the traditional way. Sound quality is awesome and loud enough for a good sized living room and dining room area with only this speaker. A+++",0
4,"Works almost as well as my previous echo
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,"I needed a new echo for another room in my home, I replaced the old one with the new one in my bedroom.  Everything seems to work fine but the bass seems to be more active than in the old one and makes music and voice with P sounds boom too much.",0
4,"Upgrade from the echo dot
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,"I purchased a dot a year ago as a way to enter into the smart speaker venue. I couldn_ believe how much we ended up using it. My family listens to music a lot, and I thought this would be better to have in the kitchen, which is a larger area. The sound is better than the dot (although I was still impressed with the dot), the bass is deeper and I feel like it has a bigger range. I would recommend this for anyone wanting something a little more than a dot for music.",0
1,"Alexia is a scam to purchase music streaming
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,I purchased three of these Alexia units and later found out I had to buy  a Music subscription to play music in all three rooms. I plan to return the other two of this is the case. There should be a clear transparent message on the box,0
5,"A new love!
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,I really love this!  Just think of a favorite song or singer from the past and BOOM~  it's right there!!  I didn't think I wanted one until our daughter (who knew better) sent us one as a gift.,0

",7.Jan.20,Yes,I think alexa is a wonderful benefit for everyone. It is so much fun to use and the information we learn is unbelieveable.,0
5,"Replaced an occuring Sirius XM bill
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,I use my Echo 99% just for music so far...I was able to cancel one of my satellite accounts bc now I can play it thru Alexa. I like that I can set my station and then turn off the microphone for privacy. Overall I'm glad I went for the Echo,0

5,"easy to set up and start using right away
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,"I'm not a techy person, so I appreciated the step-by-step app instructions and further online instructions &amp; FAQ to learn more ""skills"". Easy to do! The speaker is excellent, better than I expected.",0
5,"Xmas present
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,"Instant variety of music at my command via voice requests across the room. No turning on stereo equipment, browsing through tapes, records and CD's. Also, requests for information instantly. Although not all my questions have been answered. That is disappointing and going to the library or my computer still does the job. Maybe the Echo data base will eventually expand and those questions will be answered? Otherwise, I'm content for now.",0
5,"Best assistant out there.
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,"It does pretty good recognizing what we say. We were able to put both of our Amazon accounts in it. For the size of the speaker, it actually sounds great. I was able to set up a voice command that controls all of the Christmas decorations in the house, which are spread out over 8 different Outlets. Turning them on and off became a house tour everyday. The adapter plugs were 4 for $20, relatively inexpensive. Next I'm going to replace one or two light switches, not all of them. Definitely the main one in the living room with the dimmer, so I can just dim the lights with a voice command. You don't have to buy expensive WiFi bulbs, you can actually replace the outlets and light switches if you want, or buy Outlet adapters if you only want one of the two outlets to be controllable. My only word of caution would be there that recordes everything you say after the Wake word, so you may want to go in now and then and delete your recordings. They say this will affect how well it recognizes your voice, but so far I don't see that happening. I have friends who use the Google and Siri products. They don't seem to work nearly as well as this does.",0
5,"Excellent.
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,It is nice to have Alexa i the house. She is always available to answer any questions I have. And also she plays music.,0

5,"still need more work on the alexa app to improve integration of multiple echos and dots
  
",7.Jan.20,Yes,"While I absolutely love the echo, the app is cumbersome to use and figure out how to enable things on alexa. Why cant I just tell alexa to do something instead of going to the app to do it? biggest issue for me is seamless integration of multiple echos and dots. I never really know what i am doing or if i have been successful.",0

",8.Jan.20,Yes,"Seems I got a lazy one. Sometimes it will give me a very detailed answer from Wiki or Google or some newspaper, but most of the time, it is too lazy to really look into what I'm asking about. I get a lot of ""Sorry. I don't know that."", or ""I'm not sure"". Occasionally, it will say, ""I'm working on refining my knowledge base"", but I think that's a cop out. I do like the music. Of course, that costs extra, as do most of the really cool things I would want to do. Also, it seems easily confused. I don't know: Maybe this one has baggage from not getting along with the other Alexa's in the warehouse.",0

3,"Great quality in 3rd generation -- but NOT a TRUE red!
  
",8.Jan.20,Yes,"This is an excellent product---3rd generation has even better sound quality than 2nd Gen. BUT, I was expecting RED, and the color is more an orange/coral, and NOT a true (fire engine) red; it has much more an dark orange appearance, with a white top (dirty fingerprints magnet) and a white plug and cord. I think this should be a true red if it's being sold as such, and should be also offered with a black top/cord/plug as an option. I gave mine to a friend, and he bought me a 3rd Gen in Charcoal, which is my preferred color. Had this been a TRUE RED, I would have hung onto it. If you like an orangey/coral color---go for it; just know that a ""conceptual"" design of red, and what actually ships are two different things. Also, I wish Amazon would add a speaker mute button; you can mute the microphone, but if your phone rings or something else requires you to want Alexa to stop making noise, you have to tell her to be quiet or pause; a speaker mute button would be nice. I suppose you could use the (-) volume control to turn her all the way down, but a quick and easy mute button would be faster and easier! Love this unit -- just not what they call ""red.""",0

1,"What a POS!
  
",8.Jan.20,Yes,"This is the future? Then I want NONE OF IT. I am a self proclaimed computer/gadget nerd and was waiting for the 3rd generation.  Call this one the POS Generation. This unit continues to ignore my commands. It hears me, blue, yellow then dark. If I wanted to be ignored, I would have stayed married. I have reset reset reset, deleted app, downloaded app, reset reset reset. This thing is about as stupid as my ex. Nice job Amazon.

",9.Jan.20,Yes,"I just upgraded from an Echo Dot to the latest Echo device, and overall I am quite pleased.  The sound quality is amazingly better for playing music from multiple sources, and interaction with Alexa is also very good.  The only quibble I have is that the new Echo does not seem to recognize my voice commands as easily as the Echo Dot when I am farther away from it; and there are a few commands that, somehow, the Echo does not understand (although the Echo Dot certainly did, and does).  Nonetheless, I am still very pleased I made the upgrade.",0

",9.Jan.20,Yes,"I love my Alexa! It's not perfect by any means. The sync system is off no matter how many times I mess with it. For example, Alexa can turn on the TV no problem. However, it won't actually control the television (like changing channels or turning the TV back off). At the same time, it's AWESOME for listening to music. The sound is incredible! The music selection is vast, too. So, I give it a solid four.",0

5,"The best sounding Alexa enabled device.
  
",9.Jan.20,Yes,I've used Alexa for several years now.. This is my 7th device. The sound quality is amazing with the 3rd gen. The only negative about this device is.. Twice now within a month (while playing music) I have said alexa.. Then the sound faded.. A few shots of static and she becomes unresponsive. Had to unplug and plug back in. This has be here happened with any other Alexa enabled device.,0

5,"I recommend the Alexa 3rd Generation
  
",9.Jan.20,Yes,The Alexa does more than I expected.  It is very convenient and blazing fast with responses,0
5,"Very nice speaker
  
",9.Jan.20,Yes,"The Echo is small but it has a powerful sound. The ease of use is not there at this time. I have to ask Alexa to do things several times before she gets it correct, especially when it comes to the firestick, and it should not be that hard because they are both created in Amazon labs. I will give them a pass because this is a new technology. I love the fact that I have a GROUP called Everywhere and I can stream music on this Echo and all three dots at the same time and it is clean and consistent through the entire house. This is very nice on days when I am cleaning the house and go from room to room, and during the holidays when I had everyone over. Overall I am satisfied, and I look for even more things from Amazon. I also have a Ring doorbell, I am on my way!",0

",9.Jan.20,Yes,The sound,0
4,"Alexa can be frustrating
  
",9.Jan.20,Yes,"The sound is good, I sometimes wonder if I should have gotten the speaker with the sub, but good sound for what I did order. I spent three days trying to get Alexa to play ""Deadmen"" By Saint PHNX, a song I purchased. Even if I had not bought it she would not have played it. Kept wanting to play ""Deadman Walking"" by IDK and IDC. So if I had prime she would have queued that up every time. Finally, while almost placing my mouth on her, Alexa figured it out on the third day. But also it is in my only playlist, that I play, then it stops after like 10 songs. I do think Amazon is trying to gaslight me into buying prime for better use of my Echo.She does do well answering questions, turning on devices, playing what music I can get out of her though.",0
5,"Big step forward in sound
  
",9.Jan.20,Yes,The sound on this one is a LOT better than the old one.  Traded a first gen in for this one and am glad I did!!,0

5,"Great device!
  
",9.Jan.20,Yes,This new version has SO much improved voice recognition in noisy environments.  Truly amazing how it can pick up the wake word no matter what is going on.,0
5,"Scary but so neat
  
",9.Jan.20,Yes,"This was a Christmas gift.  I did not want it, left it boxed for a few days, and generally wondered about sending it back without offending the gifter.  Then I un-boxed it.  30 minutes later I ordered another Echo for upstairs, and since then purchased a Sonos Beam with Alexa soundbar for our TV.  It's like an entire new world to us.As perspective, we use Siri for dictation and questions, but had a scary incident when the ""Hey Siri"" feature was first activated by Apple.  We discovered she was listening to us when Siri started replying to what she heard on TV.  So that feature got turned off  fast on our iPhones and iPads.  The fact that we can switch off Alexa's microphone is of great comfort to us.  But more importantly, the many things Alexa can do that greatly expands our electronic footprint and comfort zone was worth the effort.  We are happy campers.  I just wish Alexa would stop asking if we want to order more pet treats...we're afraid our pup will bark while we're out and who knows what we'll end up with.",0

5,"Amazing Sound
  
",9.Jan.20,Yes,What a change from my Echo (1st Gen). The sound is amazing out of this small form factor device. I actually enjoy listening to music on it. I especially love that you can change the 3.5mm jack to either Input or Output. That is a very useful feature. I connected an old streaming device to the new echo and I can listen to my music library through the new Echo speaker. This is a definite upgrade from my original 1st Gen echo.I may start upgrading all my original Echos.,0
5,"Please help

1,"Won_ connect with Spotify. Customer support won_ call back.
  
",9.Jan.20,Yes,"When it works the sound is great. However, it doesn_ work very often. Sometimes it_l play when I want to play and then it_l just stop. Or sometimes the subwoofer will play but then the echo won_. We have no clue why it does this because customer support won_ call us back. Even though they said they would.

",10.Jan.20,Yes,"First of all how about the names. You know I mean Amazon Echo and computer couldn't you be a little bit more inventive than that. This one was a gift. I have a total of 3 now. All in all they are all very good. My original Echo and this latest one have a very good sound to them. I believe the concept behind them is good, but they need refinement as sometimes I ask a question to which I receive a sensible answer another time I'll ask the same question and I'll get something like I don't know",0

4,"The best time to upgrade old hardware. Now!
  
",10.Jan.20,Yes,"I love this version of Alexa. I have the original echo as well. The biggest difference between this echo and the 1st gen is probably voice recognition, its can really pick up voices even while music and or audiobooks are playing. The next best improvement is probably sound quality, the bass of this echo is impressive. I haven't needed to push the volume past 6 for music and 4 for audiobooks. This is a very good gift for the right person. Or even yourself. Highly recommended.",0
5,"Fun, entertaining, and informative.
  
",10.Jan.20,Yes,"I purchased it mainly for music since I don't have a stereo in my home other than a small boombox, which I don't use because it doesn't sound all that great. But I have to say that Echo sounds better audio quality than the portable radio. I have hearing loss due to an accident years ago, so I really shouldn't be rating sound quality, it is difficult for me to hear some tones. The Alexa app on my Android phone has a simple EQ. While it does help, it's not sensitive enough to compensate for my poor hearing.Even so, I can hear good enough to enjoy music on my Echo, which is linked in a special group with two Echo Dot devices in separate rooms. I can walk around the house and have music wherever I go. This is an awesome feature.I've learned to use it for weather and news reports as well as set reminders, timers, and lists. Plus I have some fun askingng Alexa to play Star Trek sounds and other cool stuff.I also set Alexa to ""away"" mode when I leave the house and she listens for common noises like glass breaking and will alert me if she hears anything suspicious. She's definitely not a security device. But it's nice to know she's got an ear for possible intruders and will let me know.A great feature is the relaxing music or pleasing sounds that I play when going to sleep. I especially like the ocean waves for sleeping.One issue I've experienced, Echo and Echo Dot become unresponsive once in a while. I have to unplug and reconnect power to reinitialize functionality. I'm not sure what's causing this problem? It could be my network/WiFi signal or some other problem technical problem so I can't ding Echo for the issue just yet. Luckily the issue is random and infrequent.I'm still discovering new features. I never thought I'd say this, but Alexa with Echo has enhanced the enjoyment of my home. In all, I love my Echo.",0

5,"Good sound, good looks.
  
",10.Jan.20,Yes,"We bought this to replace a 3rd Feb. Echo Dot. The Dot has good sound for its size, but we wanted better. This one is a real improvement for listening to music and podcasts. The Echo Studio would have better sound, but at twice the price of the Echo. We like the looks; much more attractive than the 1st gen. Voice recognition is better than the Dot also; maybe because there are more microphones. The fact that we got a Black Friday discount is icing on the cake. Very satisfied with this purchase.",0
5,"Extra location is most helpful.
  
",10.Jan.20,Yes,"We were given an Alexa with a subsidiary Echo Dot for Christmas,  which we placed in the living room and kitchen. We like it so much that we purchased an additonal Echo Dot for the library upstairs. We haven't explored all the functions, but so far we've found it very helpful for music in different locations, as well as being able to add to the shopping list whenever an item occurs, rather than wait til we are able to write it down on a shopping list. An additional feature is that when someone is out grocery shopping, and the one at home suddenly remembers something which they'd forgotten was needed, they can add it to the list, and it appears on the shopper's phone. Very helpful!",0

5,"Nice!
  
",10.Jan.20,Yes,"Works fine.  Sounds good.  The improvements that need to be made all lie within the Alexa app. The faults that I found,so far, are the  inability to loop a song (and especially a playlist) indefinitely. My sleep list, or even a looped song play out before I'm ready to get up.  Also, no battery compatibility- at least not in the USA.I'm not sure yet about his one, but I'm wondering if can I use the speaker AND broadcast it to a Bluetooth receiver/device at the same time?  I mean hear both the Echo and the other device(s) at the same time.",0
