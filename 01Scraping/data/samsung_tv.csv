5.0,"Good quality in a smaller TV
  
","July 7, 2018",Yes,"I wanted a TV to wall-mount in my bedroom where I have limited space. I was a little surprised to learn that it's actually getting difficult to find a top-quality TV in a smaller size these days - this Samsung was about the best we could find in a 32"" model. Still, despite it's small size, it does have all the essential features, as well as a very good picture quality.The TV itself is very light weight and was easy to wall mount. I used an articulating arm mount that lets me tilt and position the TV any way I want, and the light weight helped make this easy. The TV remote is the same as other recent Samsung TV's use, so if you're used to the layout, it will seem very comfortable to you.This is a ""smart"" TV, meaning that it has apps for things like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and many others available. With a fast internet connection, you should have no trouble watching whatever you like through the TV, even if you're a cord-cutter. It's probably a small thing to most people, but I also appreciate that the power draw - especially when the TV is off - is very low.I'd rate the picture quality as very good overall, with a nice bright picture that's sharp and contrasty with most content. Black levels are good, and about the only thing I notice is a certain ""harshness"" that's common to lots of TV's these days. I admit, I was a plasma holdout, and now my main TV is a 75"" OLED just to avoid this issue, so I may be a little more sensitive than most.Overall, if you need a good quality smaller Smart TV that's still capable of putting a nice quality image in front of you, then this Samsung is definitely worth a try.",264
5.0,"A Wonderful Smaller TV for a Good Price
  
","September 3, 2018",Yes,"If you'd like a not-large TV, this will very well work for you, and I'm glad Samsung decided to make a current (2018) model in this size. The hardest part of the set up for me was attaching the two little stands (at each end of the set, for placing the TV on a table or stand)--you need a screwdriver, and I found it not easy insert the 4 screws. Also, it takes a while to follow the on-screen instructions to connect the TV to WIFI and to register the TV with Samsung. Too bad that the remote does not have a voice-activation feature, as you have to input quit a bit of info, one character at time, but I guess that's what you have to do now with any other ""smart"" TV. Two suggestions: 1. The stands (as well as the TV) are very lightweight and it seems it would be very easy to tip the set over if you're not careful, so I used black duct tape to ""secure"" the stands to my stand, and that works fine; 2. Consumer Reports has a feature wherein if you input the make and model #, it will prescribe settings that you should follow for an optimal TV picture. (Of course you have to subscribe to CR in order to take advantage of this feature, unless you know someone who is a subscriber.) I must say, that worked very well for me. I sit about 5 to 6 feet away from the TV, and, frankly, I wanted a set size that wasn't overwhelming and ""too too,"" if you know what I mean.",115

Luckily, my IT guy at work told me to unplug it (we have one at our Library that is the same model)....it worked.  Then, last week, the screen turned a funky shade of blue.  Turning off then on didn't clear the problem but unplugging it did.  Sometimes the sound doesn't come on with the tv.  I don't know what's up with this model but it definitely isn't my old Samsung.  Not satisfied at all.",88

","January 23, 2019",Yes,"I bought this on sale at Amazon during the Christmas holidays. It came when promised and I set it up with the help of the cable guy. I wanted to make sure I didn't screw it up. The picture, sound, and size were better than what I had expected. For five days I was in bliss. This was going to be a good year. All my favorite show would be a joy to watch. On the sixth day in the morning, I tried to turn the TV on with the cable remote. The cable box came on, but the TV did not. I tried the remote that came with the TV. Nothing. I tried again with the manual button and got nothing. I sent it back for a refund. Then I ordered another one just like the first. What would be the odds of two TV's doing the same thing? ( I really could have used Mr. Spock.) I set it up and it worked great. The next morning the same thing happened. This time I unplugged it, waited 30 seconds and plugged it in again. It worked. I called Sam Sung and spoke to an agent and told him everything. He said that the TV was making an adjustment and to give it a week to see if that would correct it and to call back if it happened again. Well, it happened again. This time he wanted me to unplug it and wait for 60 seconds, replug it and see if it happens again. If it does it again I'll speak to a supervisor. The model number isUN32N5300AF. I try to be patient with people and let them solve problems that come in front of them. I'm retired and I'm getting old. Some people may think me a fool, but I believe in giving people a chance. However, I can only go so long then things must change for the better. I hope this will help people in their choices. I hope you have better luck than me.",59

It has the same exact problems! Sometimes the tv won’t turn on until you pull the plug for a few seconds then plug it back in, sometimes it turns on with distorted sound so pull the plug to fix that and sometimes the sound to picture timing is off. I’m not an expert when it comes to electronics but, I believe most of the issues are caused by the smart  part of the tv. It acts like a computer that is busy doing something or has jammed up due to lack of computing power. I’m hoping that Samsung will come out with a software update that will fix this problem but, if they don’t do something soon I can see this losing lots of customers for them. Every tv in my house is a Samsung and I’ll be looking elsewhere in the future. I will say that when it works, it’s got a great picture but so do other tv out there today.",20

3.0,"Could be better
  
","December 1, 2018",Yes,"Unfortunately, I have received this TV broken - the screen was severely damaged, and I had to return it. Ordered a replacement from Walmart, which arrived in 2 days with free shipping! Overall, its a good TV with a very decent picture and sound quality for a small set. Also, it is one of the better TVs of this size, and it is very easy to mount in a small space. However, there a few things to consider before buying it. First, it appears to be overpriced. For $40 more you can buy a 50-inch Samsung smart TV, 6-series, which is much better then this one in every possible way. Second, the speakers are relatively loud, but the sound is a little distorted - somewhat metallic and unpleasant. Third, the picture is very bright, but the colors and contrast are not quite realistic. Perhaps the greatest disappointment is a not so smart (and somewhat irritating) ""smart"" component. Whereas the TV comes with preloaded applications, the setup is not user friendly, and Samsung does allow for any meaningful customization. Moving from one application to the next, changing channels and viewing guides is much more difficult compared with streaming devices, such as Roku. Also, there are almost no additional applications, which can be downloaded from the Samsung store. I have another (older) Samsung TV, which works much better for streaming Internet content than this one (with a Roku streaming stick, which can be purchased for $30-45). One advantageous feature is an inbuilt browser. However, it's is hardly usable without a keyboard and mouse.",12

5.0,"My Research Bore Out: FANtastic TV
  
","November 19, 2018",No,"32"" is perfect viewing in small room size. Picture quality &amp; sound: outstanding (disagree with reviews that are negative on sound &amp; say you need a separate soundbar). Feet/stand very secure, but note that you'll need a 'skinny'/thin flat screwdriver to attach (single handle where you can change bit sizes will likely be too thick to fit inside). For extra safety I plan to use Gorilla Duck tape to attach to table (but am waiting to first buy/receive a height adjustable up to 9"" swiveling base). Setup/connection very easy (back of tv clearly color coded to wires; on screen setup fast &amp; simple without needing mobile phone app). You will need to know your WIFI password to enter during setup. Best TV I've ever had! Family loves it. Seems silly to me that people buy lesser quality brands for very small $ savings over this TV (especially when a TV is a long term purchase). In my opinion Samsung is best TV (LG used to be a close second, but now a far second; cheaper Insignia TVs are a far third if you're really tight on every dollar). MSRP on this TV increased this year, but sale prices are actually lower than past years!Only small negative is the included remote control. It's not as ergonomic to hold/use as my Comcast remote (plus I'm used to the keys/location on it). Most remotes though (including Comcast) can be universally programmed to any TV, but you need to know your TV's remote code (took many links/time to find it). For this 2018 Samsung model, it's: 10702. Search up the instructions for entering the code on your remote (yours will be different from mine, &amp; please don't ask me to search for you).",3
3.0,"Decent Picture, HORRIBLE Sound
  
","December 29, 2018",No,"Note: Rating of 3/5 includes the built-in speakers, probably 4(maybe 4.5)/5 not accounting the speakers.Haven't had this television for too long, but I have been messing around with it the past few days. Here are my initial impressions(will edit an update if anything changes).Picture -When it comes to the picture, the picture is adequate. It's not so good out of the box(move those backlight/sharpness sliders down friends!). I used ""Movie"" mode. The colors are a bit off out of the box, but can be changed to be somewhat manageable. I saw an online review mentioning that ""warm2"" was the best color temperature for accuracy, however there must be some kind of quality control consistency with these panels, because warm2 looked really bad. Both warm and warm2 produced VERY orange shifted colors, making everything seem coated with carrot color(even black and white). For my television, ""Normal"" color temperature seemed closest to what I'd assume is more closer to accurate(slightly off-white whites). I left it on ""cool"" however, to make white - white, for better general viewing. The colors are a bit hyped out of the box, which you'll need to dial down a bit unless you want everyone to look sunburned.This television sort of struggles with the blacks, as expected for IPS, but it's on the worse end. A lot of things will seem a bit on the gray side instead of black. It's difficult to get good blacks without having to mess up the rest of the picture. Speaking of IPS, due to it having an IPS screen, the viewing angles are not bad. There is a slight shift in color/brightness to the sides, but most of the shift for me seems to be noticeable when viewing it from a higher angle.Sound -This is the real downfall for this TV, the sound. It sounds BAD. When I say bad, I mean just really bad. It's both muddied and shrieking at the same time. With the standard sound, male vocals pretty much always sound distorted/muddied and pushed back, while female vocals sound muddied,thin, and fairly upfront. The sound travels fairly far(which is a disadvantage for us, since it can disturb others in the house). The ""amplify"" sound setting makes it sound a little bit better, but it leaves it sounding very peaky, as when I heard it from another room, all I would hear is the ""ch ch ch"" sound from the treble when people were speaking.It's one of the worst sounding TV speakers we have in our home. Our older extremely thin smaller LG TV with smaller speakers sounds a lot better, and our similarly sized TCL TV from a few years ago also sounds a lot better. I'm pretty sure my extremely small(smaller than a small plastic cup) bluetooth speaker even sounds better than the TV. When I looked underneath, the speaker seemed like it was quite a decent size, so I'm a bit lost on how it can sound so bad. I very highly recommend you budget a soundbar into the price when purchasing this TV. It's just atrocious sounding. Some notes I wanted to mention is that this TV does not have a 3.5mm output, so you're limited to optical/HDMI, and this television has an equalizer for the built-in speaker(only works for the speaker) with 100 Hz, 200 Hz, 500 Hz, 1 KHz, 2 KHz, 5 KHz, and 10 KHz adjustment points. Lastly, it seems like the more ""muddy"" sound comes through the vents at the top of the unit. If you can isolate the sound coming from the vents from the bottom, it can sound slightly better(still horrible though).Features/control -It's not as simple to navigate as the TCL Roku TV we had purchased. The menu layout is a bit clunky. Setting options are also quite limited for the device apart from the settings you don't usually find on others(like the equalizer or the white balance settings). The IR sensor seems to be a bit finicky, as sometimes I press the remote and it doesn't respond, unless I'm holding it perfectly, but it also works at unusual angles as well so it's a bit strange.The TV can be a bit sluggish randomly, but it's generally adequate in terms of speed.When it comes to connectivity, this television has a basic Ethernet jack if needed. Its included wireless seems to be ok as well without any glaring performance issues in terms of the wireless.This television comes with a number of pre-installed apps. You can remove them from your ""Home"" page, however you cannot uninstall these pre-installed apps it appears.Design -No premium design with this set. Its design screams budget, unlike some other sets at this price point that try to add some minor 'premium' design features here and there. Speakers are downward facing on both sides. The TV stand legs does not lift the TV high enough to place other devices(like a DVD player or smaller cable box) underneath.Update Edit:I noticed that there seems to be no way to disable this television's Wi-Fi Direct functionality. There is also no option to automatically deny any Wi-Fi Direct requests. As it stands, Wi-Fi Direct is always on and you will receive a popup on your screen if any nearby device tries to connect. Based on the support articles, older Samsung televisions used to have the option to disable it it seems(or at least enable it if it was disabled).  I don't understand why Samsung feels like this should always be on. My Roku TV allows for both Wi-Fi Direct disabling(assuming you don't use the Wi-Fi Direct remote models) as well as the option to automatically deny any Wi-Fi Direct requests. I had it disabled temporarily by resetting the network settings, but it returned back once the TV was power cycled.Update Edit 2: It seems like HDR content has separate video settings. If you set video settings for SDR content, you're going to have to adjust the settings as well when you end up on HDR content.Update Edit3: We've now had this television for a few months. I have read other reviews concerning this television not turning on. We had not had that happen until today. Tried to turn it on(by remote/button) and the power light would change to indicate the difference, but nothing on the screen/no audio. Had to unplug/replug. Hopefully this does not continue to occur.",1
1.0,"Buyer Beware Samsung HDCP 1080P Major Conflicts!!!
  
","May 20, 2019",No,"Don't make the mistake I did buying a 1080P TV from Samsung that will never display 1080P...  The HDCP copy protection along w/ the firmware from Samsung does not work properly with Blu-Rays or other devices...  I didn't realize I was seeing in 1080i only when I got mine until I tried hooking up a Blu-Ray player... It wont even detect it in 1080P without a disc in it much less play anything legally bought in 1080P... I've seen many who had auto updates turn their TV into useless trash by creating a conflict... I had no idea what HDCP was or anything else, most of the TVs wont even update as they are supposed to... I tried updating my firmware using 3 different USB sticks, deleting every file on them... Doing everything possible... Making the bin file the only thing on the stick... Making its own directory then putting it in there... Putting the file in zipped/unzipped, nothing will even read it, I've been on-line since 300 baud modems... So if are old tech or new, trust me on this, just avoid anything Samsung.  Even the USB port has a copy protection on it forcing to register to supposedly be allowed to use it???  You can't even buy a TV, stick a USB in it to play things without them trying to make it difficult?  I'm basically only given the option to go in pirate sites or use pirated stuff if want to view it... Since the legally bought Blu-Rays or players refuse to allow me to watch what I own/paid for because of bogus HDCP?",0
4.0,"Great picture but problematic sound, would stick with Dumb TV
  
","December 9, 2018",No,"The picture is great, even from the side. The interface is somewhat confusing and a lot to get used to. Based on my experience, I would not buy this more expensive smart TV (or probably any other), but would stick with an Amazon fire or Roku box instead. You are beholden to the TV manufacture's software that has been installed and whether the app you want to run has been written to support the software. As an example,  there is no Acorn app written for Samsung so I have to keep my Amazon fire box connected to this ""smart"" TV just to see the one streaming service. Amazon Fire/Roku has the best selection of apps.I knew audio would be a problem but I didn't think it would be much of a problem. I bought to TV thinking that I can't do anything to fix the picture, but I have options to get the audio working. First the sound is adequate for my small room. But there are times (movie dialog) when I could use a crisper sound for my old ears. I could not hook up my computer speakers because they have a headphone jack and the TV only has an optical digital output connection. I knew that before the purchase. So I bought a digital to analog converter. I got it to work after changing the settings: audio out changed from TV speakers to optical digital; audio type to PCM. It works but I didn't realize that you cannot control the volume of a digital audio device using the Samsung remote. Volume control is disabled. I don't know if this true for all TV companies but it seems like a ridiculous feature. So if I keep this setup, I will have to get up every time that I want to change the volume. I haven't done that for 20 years. My only option now is to get a sound bar or any other audio device that can be controlled with it's own separate remote control ... add another remote to the coffee table.There was an annoyance in trying to register the TV on the Samsung site. This has to be done if you want to connect to Smart Hub where you can download apps. Here again, Amazon/Roku has a simpler design. The serial number was not accepted on the registration page. After a 30 minute online chat with a Samsung tech, I was told it would have to resolve further up the support chain. I am still waiting.I have only had the TV for 4 days so I am sure I will add to my review as I find more things out.",0
5.0,"Fabulous on the second try - odor issue.
  
","December 7, 2018",No,"Most of our flat screen TVs  have been Samsungs - they have a superior picture quality. We needed a new 32""  to replace our aging 32 which is mounted in a custom built cabinet  - and they no longer make 36"" models here so another 32 inch was required. Our eleven year-old unit worked fine but the picture was slowly fading (as was  our aging eyesight). First of all, there are not a lot of choices out there in this size. I went to our local big box discounter and picked up the 32 inch 1080 Samsung smart TV - again, the Samsung  had the best picture on display.It was an easy install, light weight, and had an incredibly clear and bright picture. However, there was an electric smell emanating  from it.  Checking  reviews revealed one reference to this anomaly. We waited three weeks hoping it would dissipate  but it did not.Disappointed, I  returned it to the dealer and immediately bought a recommended Vizio 32 inch 1080. It was an easy  install but we found the picture clearer in some ways but a little muted  - despite all the adjustments you could do - basically it is good  feature filled tv but the picture not to our liking. That unit was returned the same day. Got all the money back.Given the limited market offerings  in 32 inch tvs we  decided to give the Samsung one more try hoping that our previous units was just a lemon. The original dealer had no more Samsungs.Went to another dealer showroom and once again that same 32 inch 1080 Samsung out-shined the competition. The salesmen said that it was their best 32 inch and he had not heard of the odor issue, and knew of no returns  for that model (he looked it up on their in-store system). They had a good return policy (30 days) plus a very affordable 2 year extension, and it had a holiday season mark down of 100$ less (a 33% discount) than I paid for my first one.  Well, again installed it and then waited for the oder, which was barely noticeable compared to the  first unit  and gone after a few days. So...our first unit was really defective.We love the tv.The moral is that anyone buying a tv should see it in person before  buying and make sure that the vendor (online or brick and mortar) has a no fee 100% cash back return policy for  at least one month in case you get a rare defective unit..Good fishing!",0

Since every TV I have purchased in the last 20 years has had a headphone jack (probably adds $1 to cost of production) I have to rate this and all Samsungs unacceptable.",2

","January 24, 2019",No,"I am not sure you can find a better picture in this size, 32 inches. But I don’t understand how the manufacturer could put this product out with the most poorly engineered power connection. The power cord (very short) will barely connect to the tv and falls out if you want to adjust positioning of the tv. Honestly, if the cord is not positioned in the right manner, the power will disconnect. This can’t be good for a tv. I am going to research and contact the company to see if I have a lemon. The picture - superb - powering it a major flaw, I think in this tv.",1
2.0,"Mediocre TV
  
","February 1, 2019",No,"Samsung has been a go-to for years. These TV's are mediocre unfortunately.1)First one had a pink screen (hardware malfunction).2)Noticeable VOC smell out of box, hoping it dissipates.3)Viewing angles are terrible compared to my 2015 model. Viewing from the side is not too bad, but up or down even a little and the picture goes dark.4)The bezel is clearly separated for the screen on the bottom and sides like they didn't install it correctly or use any adhesive. Even a light touch to the screen in the bottom corners and it pops farther off the bezel.I use this as a computer monitor and a TV and while the picture is good from straight on, all of these issues have me thinking of paying the double cost for a quality monitor. If there are this many visible issues I hate to think of what else is wrong here that I can't see from the outside.I don't use any of the smart features or let them have internet access because that would be stupid. What you really want is a media computer connected to a TV. And I think what I really want, is a computer monitor. Worked great with the TV's from 3 years ago. Not anymore.",0

It has a button you press in and slide, what could be sticking??? I will say all the reviews say that the tv has a bad tiney sound, my husband and I thought the tv had a very nice sound to it, glad we didn’t invest in a sound bar. Picture quality is excellent!

A call to Samsung and got the same instructions as described here,  only to have that “fix” last for a few weeks instead of a few days but then goes back to the old every-other-day failure.

The sound goes out randomly and the TV will not respond to the power button at times (sometimes it will not turn on/other times it will not turn off).  As stated in an earlier post, Samsung’s answer to all of the issues is to reset the TV by unplugging and waiting a few minutes before turning back on.  This works temporarily however the TV needs to be reset several times a week.  We have now moved it to the guest room to collect dust.  One positive- it does collect dust really well!",2

","October 9, 2019",No,"I was excited to buy this TV, as I have two other Samsung HDTV's that have been great.  I purchased this for our bedroom and was impressed with the picture quality.  However, the sound quality was weak and had to be optimized to listen at a reasonable volume.  Bigger problem was that the TV started cycling and shutting off and on.  The next morning it wouldn't turn on until I unplugged the set from the surge protector and plugged it back in.  I initially thought it was the cable service and had Comcast come out and check everything inside and out.  The tech said the problem was with the TV.  I returned it to the store and got another one as I figured it was just an anomaly and I really liked the picture quality.  The replacement said had the exact same problems.  It took it back and bought another brand.  Do not buy this set!",0

I was playing PS4 and the colors went dark and starting to fade, few seconds later, it goes black screen. I turned the TV on/off and still black screen, I could hear the game through my headset so I know its a problem with the TV. I unplugged my HDMI from the TV that is connected to the PS4 to test the TV independently without it being plugged to anything. So I turn the TV on/off few times and still no picture. I could hear the sound in the TV too but no picture. So I went to sleep to see if it over heated or something, woke up the next day and still getting this issue, just black screen. I have like only 10 hours on this TV and already ran through this problem which pisses me off because I have to wait another 5 days since it seems like no body carries this TV in store. I will go return it and order new one from Best Buy (Where I purchased it).Once I get the new one and use it for few weeks, I will update this review but for now, very disappointed that I only got like 10 hours on the TV and already black screen. Don't recommend it to be honest because I seen bad reviews on best buy and here as well",0
