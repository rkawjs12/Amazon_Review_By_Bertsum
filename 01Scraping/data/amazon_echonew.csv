5.0,"The Pros, Cons and Oks for the Echo 3rd Gen (HR).
  
","October 18, 2019",No,"Pros:• This is a solid built machine. Very sturdy and no dust cracks, while retaining its simple form. One of the few times I can say you’re getting exactly what every picture on the web is showing.• I had the basic black design, but I do appreciate that Amazon is offering more colors rather than there basic set (even if it’s only a few generic colors).• The mute option is the most appreciative tool. When you activate it the classic blue glow will fall into the red, giving you the visual display that your privacy is being protected.• The sound performs exactly what it’s built for. I found no issue in testing in an open living room. The volume goes to great levels as once again, for a 360-degree smart speaker, Amazon reigns supreme.• Testing all ranges of music, I found that that bass to be rich and powerful. My colleague has the previous Echo Plus and she states that there is an improvement in the bass with this Echo. An overall rich sound when a piano came in and a warmer outcome when acoustics came into play (You’ll get the bass experience when you hit those hard beats).• Like any other model, the Bluetooth connectivity between a third party stereo works flawlessly. I tested this out with some Bose surround sound, and nothing but clear music. You can also pair the Echo if you have smaller / weaker speakers. Both together will pump up the experience.• The connectivity is so flawless that buying two of these devices (or use Echo’s previous versions, if you have one) and put them in separate locations doesn’t make this a bad idea. You’re going to get great quality in music without paying an am or a leg for it.• I have to appreciate Amazon for not pushing their music platform. They offer the usual Spotify (which I used) but also Apple Music, Deezer, TuneIn, even BBC sounds. You’re getting a lot more features than just a basic smart speaker.• Using Google Home for over a year I can say that just saying “Alexa” felt more natural than saying “Ok Google.” Not to mention having Alexa listen to me every time I said: “Alexa” (Google Home users will understand this).• Like before, smart applications fit like a glove in this system. I only used it for lights and the Echo was spot on. This feature is more common than ever on any smart speaker, and the Echo does what it’s supposed to do.• I admire the organization of the app because it’s your remote control on anything you want the Echo to do. Turn off lights, switch music, mute volume, install new features, and so forth. We all carry our phones like carrying our driver licenses when going outside. This day in age I’ll always prefer an app than a physical remote.• I did some Alexa calls on this and found only clear responses and answers (this will depend on your Wi-Fi).• I would give 70% of Alexa sounding more human.• Everything is in the cloud so, you don’t need to worry about manual updates. All taken care of.• As I mentioned before, everything else is the same in a smart speaker. Ask for the weather, traffic, upcoming appointments, and all other general questions. I didn’t test all of them because…well is the same technology as last year.• The biggest difference in my book is the price. Newer and cheaper.Cons and Oks:• No Zigbee controller. This isn’t much of an issue, but if you already have a smart house layout than you’ll need to spend some extra time configuring with the Echo. The issue for this is that it puts more work on the Echo than you need. Also, there may be some smart devices that won’t work on the Echo because of this. I know last year's models had some connectivity issues with Philips Hue bulbs. Keep an eye out for which smart devices are compatible with the Echo.• I did notice that the app slows down when you put a lot of apps and smart applications in the Echos. I tested a lot of features out that require a decent amount of downloads, but the results did create a delay in the app. I have to assume without Zigbee’s software, if you have a lot of smart applications connected to the Echo, and with the general apps you use, there will be a delay in the long run.• The Echo gets loud. Loud enough that you’ll get some distortion when you’re around 95% in volume. The effect is shown when a lot of bass is begin made. Please note that 90% and up is booming your entire house.• Compare to Google Home, Alexa still isn’t the brightest smart speak in the family. For the basic day to day task it works fine, but those random questions that we tend to have throughout the day Alexa doesn’t deliver. Alexa will usually provide you with a quick one-sentence summary (Unlike Google, it would provide you a short paragraph.). This issue doesn’t happen all the time, but you’ll notice it when it does.• I’m trying to learn Spanish, so asking smile Spanish questions with Alexa is not reliable. Example I will say “Alexa, what does “Qué estás haciendo” in Spanish mean (What are you doing?)? Alexa will say “What are you happy.” I’ve been studying for 6 moths so my speech on that sentence was spot on, but Alexa. Not a reliable study buddy.• I had the first version of the Echo and all I can say is I miss the rotation ring. Bring it back Amazon.• The design is nothing new. It’s built very solid, but it’s identical to Echo Plus 2. My colleague had the Echo Plus and putting them aside there was no way you can tell the difference (a nice note if you want to steal your friends and replace it with the last version).• Even the sound is almost similar to the previous Echo. Both are fantastic, but almost the same.Bottom Line:It’s a great smart speaker system, but almost identical in every way as its previous model. There is nothing wrong with that because Amazon does put in a lot of features into this Echo that makes this right in the top three (Google Home, HomePods, and the Echo Family). It’s accurate, excellent sound, and lower in price than its previous model.Some concerns are the effects in the long run with those who have a decent amount of smart applications, and making sure the compatibility can be performed accurately. Also knowing the limits of what Alexa can and can’t do as the hardware is identical to its previous version. I wouldn’t be surprised if you want to just read Echo’s previous model amazon reviews. Trust me when I say that they’re almost identical in sight and performance.In the end, the reason it doesn’t matter about the flaws is because the price is well worth what you’re getting. It’s a machine that I can see using it every day for the simplest things such as setting up an alarm to enjoying it in small parties. I will say that if you’re planning to use your surround sound stereo connected to this, then this is a must buy. You pay a heavy price for a HomePod, enjoy a generic performance for a Google Home, and are presented with an overall user-friendly experience with the Echo 3. Cheaper than its predecessor and the worth every penny.Overall: A tiny upgrade from its previous model, but still an excellent experience in sound for all.Hope I was a help to you.Love,Honest Reviewer","1,270"
5.0,"Bittersweet Upgrade
  
","October 21, 2019",Yes,"I purchased my first Alexa Echo 1st Gen two years ago and I fell in love right away! It was bittersweet for me to replace it with the newer 3rd Gen but they had an amazing trade-in offer so I had to take advantage of it. First thing to note this Echo is much shorter than Gen 1 but a little wider which I prefer because it looks and fits better on my kitchen island. The new blue color is amazing if you’re considering getting it! Setting up the new Echo was the easiest most seamless process! I literally took it out of the box, plugged it in and in under a minute it set itself up and was ready to use! I didn’t have to do anything, it was already programmed with my smart lights and my WiFi, couldn’t ask for an easier setup. I love my Echo and use it every day and if you’re considering getting one, I say go for it! If I had to critique or complain about anything the only thing I could say is the wall adapter is really large since it’s still a square block like Gen 1.  This is more of a personal opinion but Gen 1 had a rotating top to turn the volume up and down (which I loved) where as Gen 3 has volume up and down buttons. Functionally they both work I just though the rotating volume top was more fun and unique, but I’ll live on just fine with the buttons.",243

","October 25, 2019",Yes,"I bought an Echo and an Echo Dot. What a waste of money. They're basic; real basic. My fault for not truly understanding what I was buying. It can answer some simple questions with simple answers and do a few smart home things and has ""skills"" but that's about it. Isn't that enough? No, it isn't. I guess I thought I was getting something smart, something I could engage with, seek intelligent replies from, something connected to the world wide web of knowledge. Guess I was wrong. I got a stupid little automated squawk box; a borderline parrot. Guess I got bought. For all our great advances in technology, we're clearly still in our technological infancy. Get back to me when I can say ""Computer, describe to me quantum physics in layman's terms. Explain to me the theory of relativity. What exactly is gravity; are there gravity particles? What is the meaning of life?"" The answer to the latter better be: 42. Another big gripe is that it's constantly trying to sell me something -running through a whole dales pitch -instead of just doing or playing what I asked, or it tells me what it's about to do even though I just asked it exactly that. Now I know why it's called, Echo. I'll be getting rid of it soon. Anybody wanna buy a stupid, smart device?",163

","November 11, 2019",Yes,"This is my first time purchasing an Echo Alexa of my own. I’ve used an Alexa 2nd Gen at my job and it’s pretty nice. I noticed the difference between the 2nd and 3rd Gen is that the 3rd Gen speaker is way louder and clear and I like that. I’m still playing with it and getting used to it but I do LOVE the Twilight Blue. That’s a sexy color to be honest lol. So far, I’m impressed with it.",155
5.0,"Well worth the investment
  
","October 26, 2019",Yes,"This is by far, the best Echo / system we have owned from Amazon.We purchased 2 of the generation 3 Echos and an Amazon sub as a package (saved $80 + an additional $60 for taking the Amazon store card) to replace the Bose speaker / Echo Dot we had.We now have room filling sound as good as the Bose combo without having to physically turn on the speaker every time we wanted music.Even without the sub, the sound is robust and rich from each of the linked speakers.  The addition of the powered Echo sub fills in the lows to make it an immersive experience.Setup was fairly easy.  My only complaint was that I had trouble renaming the 2nd Echo itself.  Amazon keeps calling it another wacky name.  Overall, it took less than 5 minutes to link all 3 speakers together and be listening.Would I purchase again?  You can count on it.",123

Not only the sound quality which is as good or better than anything out there for twice the price, but for the convenience of being able to call up any song by speaking your request.How does this compare to Bose or Sonos?  Who cares, both of those are more expensive, can't be easier to setup (especially Sonos - which started out with great app function but went completely off the rails) and can't be easier to use.  You can't regret buying these things, and couples with the subwoofer, you'll be in da club...",23

4.0,"Better Sound
  
","November 14, 2019",Yes,"This is a big upgrade in sound over the Echo dot.  While we use it often in our kitchen, know that it is not high end quality sound - what do you expect from one small speaker.  It is plenty good enough for an enjoyable listening experience, especially for background music while working/cooking.  In comparison, the Echo dot sound was just too poor quality to enjoy without hooking up an auxiliary speaker and so we only used it occasionally.  I was surprised that this new unit defaults to Amazon Music rather than Prime music and so we started getting commercials mixed in to our music stream.  It takes time to get the commands right to connect to Prime music without commercials - not an issue we had with the Echo dot that this unit replaced.",12

","December 4, 2019",Yes,"We got this and was very excited to use it.  However it would not connect.  We tried every way possible.  We tried it thru the app on the phone, thru an amazon tablet, thru a Microsoft surface.  Nothing would work.  We called support.  They needed access to our computer, so I allowed it.  They did all kinds of stuff but not once did they try to connect the device.  I could see everything they were doing.  They had us putting in passwords to the connection etc.. They said our network was at risk etc.  then they tried to sell us stuff. This is the number that was given when it said to call support immediately by the way.  So after we got off the phone with support, we run a scan and all of the sudden our network is not safe....go figure.  My husband is very tech savy and he was quite sure they did something especially since they tried us to buy software to ""fix our network"" and never once tried to connect to the device.  So we had to fix that and then do a factory reset on all of our devices.  I even looked online and tried other option such as rebooting the modem, the router, the echo.  ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WORKED.  The phone we tried to use is a Samsung S10 PLus.I DO NOT RECOMMED THIS PRODUCT!",10

You can control the Echo via voice, Alexa app, or through the Amazon Music app. All of these are leaps better than the buggy Sonos app. The sound quality is fantastic and the value for your money is higher than any competitor. I do believe I will be purchasing Amazon Echos from here on out.",10

Because it was over 7 days I could not get a price adjustment. Should have had our anniversary a couple weeks sooner!People at work are waiting for my feedback to see if they should go with one of these and I can say with full confidence they need to pass on this one.Update:20 minutes after I posted this review my phone rang and it was a wonderful person from Amazon by the name of Kristina. She apologized for my experience and showed me how to adjust the bass, treble and midrange to give me the sound the device was meant to put out. She also arranged for me to return the Echo and buy another one to get the sale price. This is the gold standard of customer service that other businesses should strive for.

I often change the location of my Alexa as well because as I said I mainly use it as a speaker.  It does really well if you need to unplug it and and plug it in in another location (as in it'll connect to the wifi on it's own and you can use it as you normally would without any hassle). I got the charcoal color and it's very nice visually. The Alexa app is also very convenient to use with it. You can personalize the sound of the bass and other mixes too.

We went to upgrade our final Echo Dot to a full-fledged Echo. This was our first 3rd Gen (our 2nd Gen Echos are wonderful, so we figured, the 3rd Gen must be even better). The sound quality and ease of setup was second-to-none (comparable to 2nd Gen - no marked improvement - probably given that the 2nd Gen is about perfect). HOWEVER, we stream a lot of music in our home. And Echo usually does a flawless job at it, even syncing across devices. However, one small (arguably nitpicky) problem with this 3rd Gen unit. When you wake this unit while music is playing, it pauses the music as expected to listen to your command; however, after pausing it also sounds a momentary crackle/pop (and by momentary, a teeny-tiny fraction of a second). You start talking to it and it pops. Just enough, however, to drive you mad. And frankly, it's just not acceptable. Not when our other units work perfectly.I contact tech support, and they said that they were able to replicate it, and that it was ""completely normal."" Well, I'm a reasonable person, but this just kind of cheapens the experience, and frankly I'm not convinced it is normal behavior (by the way, we restarted it/reset it/upgraded it/basically everything to try and rectify). And maybe this wouldn't be an issue for most (the speaker is wonderful otherwise), but we use our Echos heavily, often interrupting the music to turn on lights, for example, and I just don't want to hear it pop and crackle when I'm talking to it.",5

I specifically wanted to buy another Echo product to pair for stereo and have some bass. Originally, I was going to get another dot and the sub. However I grabbed this Echo when it was on sale $60! The sub seems overpriced so I had hoped this would pair with the dot and give me the low end that I needed. I searched everywhere to see if an Echo and a dot would pair and could not find an answer! I had hoped that since both were the newest generation they would pair. NOPE! One workaround, you can play both simultaneously in the same room if you setup multiroom sound. However, the two will still not be stereo which pisses me off. AMAZON please fix this glitch. Why on earth can you not pair ANY two Echo products? Especially the same generation models?

","December 6, 2019",Yes,"We only owned a single 2nd gen dot and 2 3rd gen dots. I saw the echo 3rd gen was new and on sale during Black Friday weekend for $60, so I grabbed one. We wanted another echo dot but after reading and watching reviews I decided to spend a bit more and go with a full blown echo.The echo dot 3rd gens are amazing. They really are. For $22 on sale they are especially a no brainer. The sound quality is night and day compared to the 1st and 2nd gen dot. Like twice as good regarding sound quality and fullness and how loud it can get. Alarms will actually wake you.After watching some reviews of the new big echo here, I was sold. Now and then we use the living room echo for some music while we clean or to just goof off and dance like idiots lol. While the dot did good, why not go fuller and louder with the big echo?Well, it’s still an amazing unit. Does all the dot does, of course. However, while the sound is fuller and louder, it’s not going to blow you away. I guess maybe I overhyped it based on the reviews I saw and their reactions, but I was a bit bummed.Yes, absolutely it’s louder...my totally unscientific measurement would be it’s like....15-20% louder and fuller sounding (deep, more bass, higher highs etc). I’m not sure what I was expecting. Maybe I’d be happier regarding sound with the “studio” version? I don’t know. I don’t regret the purchase, though. The extra volume is welcome and it definitely does sound better with music. Happy but I believe I overhyped. If I had the money, I’d def replace the dots with the full echos. Only pluses and no negatives other than being less amazing as I had made it in my own head.",2
5.0,"Fantastic!
  
","December 3, 2019",Yes,"This is my first Alexa speaker, but i've been streaming music for years though various moderately high-end computer speakers and a large selection of bluetooth speakers - everything from cheapies to a 50 watt guitar amp with bluetooth.I'm not an audiophile, but I do like my music to sound good - which, to me, means balanced, not bass-heavy, with good clarity and a high end that doesn't become strident at higher volumes.I bought three of these to have at different locations around the house.  Setup was super simple, d/l the app and sign in to your Amazon account and you're up and running.  No issues at all.Here's what I love so far:  Alexa is super easy to get along with...Alexa, with whom I get along easily...?...has been a treat.  I've been an Amazon music user for a few years now.  I like the selection but using the app on a phone or tablet is a frustrating experience, and it can also be super clunky and slow on a PC, as well.With this speaker I can ask Alexa to play a song, album or playlist and it's playing within moments.  Awesome!  Also, Alexa gave me a detailed, accurate weather forecast this morning.  Nice!  I haven't explored all the features, but I primarily want these for music.And as far as that goes, the sound quality is better than I expected, and I've got no complaints.  I have one speaker on top of my fridge in the kitchen and the sound is just amazing.  Balanced and clear with more than enough bass.

We liked the different colors and twilight blue didn't disappoint.  The speaker is shorter and wider than the 1st Gen but that is a welcome change.  From a functionality standpoint, I don't see any difference from earlier gen echo devices as they can all answer questions, set timers, update lists, play music or trivia and turn on and off smart devices if you already had a hub such as Philips or Smart Things.  The 3rd Gen does not have its own hub but that was fine for us.

","December 6, 2019",Yes,"Incredibly disappointed. This was one of EIGHT Fire TV and/or Echo devices that I purchased on Black Friday, hoping to switch from Roku TV and have a seamless smarthome experience. Oh boy, was I wrong.Whether I rename the the Fire TV devices or use their original names, the echo devices CANNOT control or recognize the tv devices, even after properly pairing them under the TV &amp; Video setting in the Alexa app. I've tried to unpair, repair, restart, unregister, reregister, you name it. I've wasted days.  Generally, Alexa responds with 'I cannot find a device named ...' I consider myself very technically savy and I'm positive this is not something that I'm doing wrong. I should've read more into this before buying. TONS of people all over the internet are having this problem. It's infuriating. Plain and simple, until problems like this are fixed, Amazon is blaintantly false advertising the way that their devices work.Other cons to note:-Multiple video apps stutter and sometimes even randomly pause without ever resuming unless you physically resume them.-Alexa drastically lowers the volume of the TV when you are voicing a command. This in-and-of-itself is not a huge problem. However, it becomes a problem often when after the command is complete, Alexa does not resume the original volume of the content. When this has happened, I've had to ask Alexa to turn the volume back up to the specific number it was at.-I have two third generation echos paired as a stereo system for the TV. Often, even though I have my fire TV set as the preferred device, only the echos hear my voice, and once again, because they cannot control the TV, they say that they cannot recognize the device and then I just have to pick up the controller anyway.-The Fire TV will often think that it hears an 'Alexa' when absolutely no where near that word has been stated. Because the volume lowers drastically when Alexa is listening, it creates an obnoxious volume dip in content to listen for nothing when this happens.-You cannot set a sleep timerHonestly I could go on and on about the cons and about just how unhappy I am about these products. There are even more problems than what I listed here, but I'm not wasting too much breath, as after doing days and days of research on these topics, I've seen that Amazon has absolutely no answers to these problems, even after thousands of people have reported the same problems over and over.

I tore the ring doorbell out with my bare hands I was so pissed. By the time you open the app everything that was going to happen has already happened whoever was at the door is already gone. By the time the app opens, everything that was going to happen has already happened. So the show me feature has got to be quicker than the ring app and would be a nice addition to alexa. Then I’ve connected “the dots”.. I wondered why they call them dots, now it all makes sense. I use the dots for stereo sound in my home. They all work the same as Echo. You don’t need Echo to have the dots either. Dots are smaller so the speaker is smaller, that’s all. Great for smaller rooms and still have a good quality speaker. Better privacy controls on these.

","December 31, 2019",Yes,"Received my echo 3rd Gen unit over the holidays due to an ongoing promotion. It has great sound over the Dot version hands down - good base and highs. It takes a bit of investment of your time to learn all the nuances of what Alexa can do for you. With the app, you can set up your Echo to be an alarm clock, timer, grocery list, teach it a routine for each day (like giving the weather forecast, the latest news from a specific news source, turn on/turn off lights, thermostat control, play specific music (classical, rock, pop) etc.). But beware, the instructions for all this are not included with your Echo. You have to dig around (through e-books, YouTube, etc.) to become familiar with the commands and required outcomes. For example, my unit began to display a pulsating yellow light that became annoying at night in my bedroom. I couldn’t turn it off except by disconnecting the power. Of course, this could’ve become a deal breaker if I had to disconnect every nite (I kept all the shipping package just in case I needed to return it). Well, it turned out that this was one way the Echo communicates with you. It was trying to tell me It had a notification for me to listen to. Until I asked, “Alexa, do I have any notification?” the yellow pulsating light would’ve continued. Immediately after delivering all notifications, the yellow pulsating light stopped. By the way, the notifications were about shipping/delivery of packages coming from, wait for it...Amazon. Of course, other types of notifications are possible pending how you program your Echo. Like I said, this simple issue would’ve been a deal breaker for me if I hadn’t decided to invest some of my time in trying to resolve this simple problem. It wasn’t until I learned how to communicate with my Echo that the problem wouldn’t go away. But again, the answer was not included with this product. My feedback to Amazon would be to include a list of commands and a trouble shooting section for the buyer. By employing this one simple act, I’m sure these products would be in far more demand by their customers once they learn the how to’s of communicating with these aliens.

If you grow dependent on them, you'll have to continually replace them at your cost.  Solid State electronics should not burn themselves out, they should last years not months!  A decently manufactured product should last for years, but these devises are not that.  If Amazon wants my opinion, I would say they should build better quality products!!!The new replacement seems to wax in it's ears and it frequently takes longer to preform simple tasks like turning on the lights.  Sure it wasn't as expensive as the first one I bought, but I am very unlikely to keep buying units because the burn themselves out.  !@#$% the shareholders!  Amazon seem to make huge amounts of money and I am unhappy they are going down this path where users need to replace their garbage every year or two.Hey all you ""Green"" people out there, certainly lousy corporate strategies that rob from the customer and and are horribly just filling up landfills is a really bad strategy, particularly at the scale Amazon sales are.  If you represent a Green charity or concern, maybe your organization can attack Amazon and have them create a decent product instead of robbing from their customers having to continually buy replacements.  Besides the low down despicable ethics, it seems really bad for our environment.  Cheap lousy products are waste of time, money, and our planet's limited resources, but I'm sure some near looser at Amazon got a raise for developing a product that burns it's self out after a few months.

I would love for them to ad a feature that allowed several echo's to monitor these sounds while home. With one in the basement, kitchen, living room, and upstairs bedroom, It would be amazing if Alexa could hear a smoke detector from the basement or kitchen and then alert my bedroom echo with a very loud alarm.

","December 26, 2019",Yes,"So, after buying and trying a couple of echo dots, I bought 2 of these 3rd gen echo’s. I must say I was quite impressed with the sound after the dots. I also paired with an echo sub and a 4K Firetv Stick. With the Alexa app, the capability is there to set up a “theater” system. Actually it works pretty well. Setup took about 15 minutes including the speaker software/firmware updates.Sound.....So I’ve had for the last 20 years a 5.1 system with different high end receivers and Paradigm speakers. Now, I was NOT looking to duplicate the sound that system produced but, I was looking for something decent. Actually these 3rd gen’s paired with the little echo sub do pretty well. I’ve actually had quite a few people over that had in the past enjoyed my other system for “movie nights” or just sitting around playing cards listening to music, and they’ve all been impressed. Enough so that most are looking at setting up the same system at home.I’m not going down the road of specs and stats. I’m just going to say I’m impressed and would purchase all again.I’m hoping in the future there will be a firmware/software update that will integrate these speakers into a full surround. A 5.1 or even a 5.2 would be super.For now I’m extremely happy with them. For the price they’re great.If you’re an idiot looking for super audio file sound or Einstein knowledge for speakers then keep looking.

The Alexa integration works just fine, and the voice quality &amp; recognition are excellent.  What's not to love?Well, the problem is poor WiFi performance.  I give it 5 stars for voice, integration and sound.  However, the WiFir performance - an absolutely critical element - is poor at best.  One star for that.I have reset the device several times, moved it around the room, and done everything I can but it just has poor WiFi.  The Echo Dot I replaced could stay connected and stream literally all day long without hitch in exactly the same spot with the same WiFi. This unit, on the same WiFi, the same day, could not stream for 5 minutes before skipping and losing connection on any of several tests.As a final test, I connected it to a WiFi unit in the same room. No problem - it works beautifully if it is literally in the same room as the 802.11 device. That's not practical.I am a huge fan of Alexa &amp; the Echo's (sounds like an 80's band name) but this Echo hits a sour note.  I don't know if it is firmware or the chip set that is poor, but it's just not up to Amazon's previous device standards.",0

","December 25, 2019",Yes,i had the 1st generation Echo that I bought from a friend in 2016. I loved it. The sound quality was amazing. It did amazing things. I played fun games on it. I got the weather. I set timers. I made shopping lists. I shopped on Amazon with it. Alexa woke me up. Alexa said good night. She turned on my lights and even set light timers for me. In time there won't be anything that we can't do with Alexa. She just keeps getting better and better and I have seen that progress since I first plugged her in back in 2016. I traded in my 1st gen Echo though Amazon. I told them the condition and right on the spot I had my trade in money to use towards the new 3rd gen Echo. They even gave me a shipping label to send it back to them and when they got it there was no issue with the trade in value I received.This new 3rd gen echo is great. The sound quality is far better than the 1st gen and that one sounded great regardless of how loud I played music. Alexa keeps getting better and am happy to have one.. well many now as I have one in each room. Highly recommended. It is life changing and the price is incredible for what you are getting and all the different ways you can use Alexa. I can't wait to see what happens next.,0

","January 7, 2020",Yes,"It does pretty good recognizing what we say. We were able to put both of our Amazon accounts in it. For the size of the speaker, it actually sounds great. I was able to set up a voice command that controls all of the Christmas decorations in the house, which are spread out over 8 different Outlets. Turning them on and off became a house tour everyday. The adapter plugs were 4 for $20, relatively inexpensive. Next I'm going to replace one or two light switches, not all of them. Definitely the main one in the living room with the dimmer, so I can just dim the lights with a voice command. You don't have to buy expensive WiFi bulbs, you can actually replace the outlets and light switches if you want, or buy Outlet adapters if you only want one of the two outlets to be controllable. My only word of caution would be there that recordes everything you say after the Wake word, so you may want to go in now and then and delete your recordings. They say this will affect how well it recognizes your voice, but so far I don't see that happening. I have friends who use the Google and Siri products.

We discovered she was listening to us when Siri started replying to what she heard on TV.  So that feature got turned off  fast on our iPhones and iPads.  The fact that we can switch off Alexa's microphone is of great comfort to us.  But more importantly, the many things Alexa can do that greatly expands our electronic footprint and comfort zone was worth the effort.  We are happy campers.

5.0,"Comparing to 2nd Gen Echo
  
","December 7, 2019",Yes,"Sound Quality is an improvement to the 2nd gen echo. After about 2 weeks of moderate usage at 60-70% volume the speaker has sounded better than it did day one, as most speakers need time to break-in.Comparing it to the 2nd gen echo you can definitely hear a difference. There is a bit more low end compared to the 2nd however, I find the mid range to be more refined on the 2nd gen as the 3rd gen has more low end and high end sound.To get this straight. This speaker isn’t meant to provide room filling rich sound as it is only a single firing 3 inch woofer and a tweeter enclosed in a compact plastic housing. If your looking at rich sounding sound docks, bose soundtouch 20 or 30 would fulfill that much better and even though those are more room filling as well, audiophiles will still find it much suited to having an actual speaker and amp setup. I myself am considered an audio snob and I love playing around with audio equipment.I’m not going to compare the echo to a proper 7.2.2 channel setup but compare it to speakers in its class. Being that this is an Amazon Alexa Device it is a very useful tool in addition to your smartphone. I currently have 6 echos throughout the house and they do what they are supposed to do and that is having voice commands for lights and even notifications for your ring system as well as other smart devices you link to your Alexa account. Having the ability to connect Bluetooth to your phone is great as well if your not looking for a portable battery powered Bluetooth speaker.My main reason for purchasing this echo is the new speaker which attracted me to purchasing this and I mainly use it only in the kitchen as having background music and being able to control lights and sound while working on other things. Sound is great for the kitchen and it is plenty loud enough with very balanced sound and I find the bass to be good for it’s size. I would like to put my bose soundtouch in the kitchen but it takes up too much room and I can just place this in a corner and it’s compact enough that you won’t have to worry about knocking it over. However I have setup my echo dot onto a sound dock and linked the multi room audio so I can have music playing through Apple Music in all rooms through the echos which I think is what sets this speaker apart from let’s say the much more expensive Sonos or Bose Soundlinks. Only downside I wish I could do is have Bluetooth work with multi audio instead of having to play playlists or through other streaming services on the echo.",0

It better but not as much as the reviews of videos and online reviews that I have read.  I again maybe set my expectations a little high by the reviews I read.  Many have said the sound quality was much better and the volume was much higher.  That's not the case if you ask me.  It seems if you want a better speaker through Amazon you have to go to the 199.00 Echo Studio and that's out of my price range right now.  I'm sure for 200.00 it's much better but again I'm reviewing the Echo 3rd generation and I know it's 100.00 cheaper but if I didn't get it on sale I would have sent it back.  I know Amazon until I guess the Echo Studio has been known for it's great speakers and it's suppose to be a great smart speaker but I beg to differ on that as Alexa isn't much of an AI though Amazon things she is as she says she's a great AI.

Then another routine to wake up to an alarm, turn on the light at 50% brightness, say the current weather and traffic, a daily briefing of selected news, then play motivational music to wake up.

The fabric that covered the speakers and the shape of the tower itself gave you more opportunity to place it among anything basically. This one is chubbier and a bit duller.

After setting them up the same way I had my 2nd generation setup I can tell you that I am completely dissatisfied. although these speakers works great in a theater group when watching TV, use the wake up word Alexa to call my right Amazon Echo the light ring will respond but the echo with the Wake word Echo response verbally instead. If I remove the Amazon echos from the theater group The correct Echo will respond. I contacted technical support and they are completely clueless. I then decided to test out my whole house group that I use quite often to play my music in every room. Most of the time my speakers don't respond at all and they don't play music. if they do respond , only 1 Amazon Echo plays the music even though these Amazon echos are in the same group that I asked to play.

The first gen unit had slowed down a bit, and was beginning to struggle with running our smart home components, missing light bulbs and other things in the Hue network.This thing is FAST compared to earlier models. What would take 5-10 seconds of processing for the gen-1 takes only a second or two for this model. The sound quality remains excellent for music playback, and while the model is ""fatter"" it is noticeably shorter, making it slightly more subtle for where I have mine (on a table next to a wall).If you're looking to get your first Echo or upgrade from an older model I definitely recommend making the change.",0

It is a great device that we still use in another part of the house now that we have this newer generation version. Aside from it being a little shorter and more stout, it's otherwise no different whatsoever from the first generation. The one exception to that is the sound. The bass is just slightly better on the new device, but not a lot to make an impact. Sound is still dull, with no defining highs or lows, just more a blaring mid range sound. If they can fix this or offer a device with much better audio, we'd get that. Is it with the money to upgrade from a Gen1? I'd say no, not yet.",0

","December 10, 2019",Yes,"Bought one of these for the kitchen. It replaces a Memorex Party Cube which had thoroughly degraded over a decade.The functionality of Alexa is discussed at length everywhere and is amazing. My only issue with this device is the sound quality. I think it's inherent to the design and I did anticipate this. First of all, the bass is astounding. I didn't know something this size could create that kind of bass. I'm afraid treble is another story. In order to create the 360 degree sound, the tweeter (as you can see in the product description) is pointed upward inside the device. It fires internally. The midrange radiates quite well out of the unit as reflected sound. However, the high frequencies (say, above 14khz) do not fare so well. So overall the treble slopes off quite a bit. The old Party Cube, like the Sonos One, has outward firing tweeters, so you are not relying on sound reflection for what you hear - you get the whole spectrum straight from the source, like conventional speakers. So you miss a bit of the magic of vocals, or drum high hats, atmospheric sounds and the like. Out of the box the overall tone is weighed quite a bit to mid bass. Alexa has some basic tone control (Bass, Midrange, Treble) which can help just a bit.Overall though, the Pros outweigh the cons on this device and I'm happy to have it!",0

They wanted me to change the name and password of my WIFI network.  I explained that my WIFI stays connected without interruption to a TV, printer, 2 iPhones and 2 computers.  There is no chance that I will make changes to a properly functioning WIFI network, requiring me to update the network name and password on all my devices.

Then it swaps, then they both work but the sub is not working. If you watch tv in the early mornings like 5-6am, forget about it. No sound because the devices are unreachable for some reason. Then you have to unpair and pair them again(some devices would still show unreachable. Then you gotta unplug device and plug again). There are set up in my living room where my WiFi is.

Gotten to the point where I disconnected it and just hearing sound through my TV. Thinking about returning an echo and sub as I don’t need two echos and I’m not going to have a sub laying around for no reason. Oh and to connect musics, forget about it.

My neighbor next door had the same problem but he broke down and bought a hub so the worked thru that not the alexa itself.  I had no trouble with the outlets.

It often has Hang Ups and a red circle indicating its inability to respond to a question or at a speed at which comprable to the first generation Alexa. We had the worst time connecting it to our Wi-Fi this time. Overall we are not pleased with the change in the base which causes literally the floor to vibrate even said at the lowest level. This takes away from the actual music that's being played and we have to adjust the volume down just so we can have less Bass which compromises the listening experience.

I had bought a sound bar but wasn’t impressed with the sound when I played my music and watching tv/movies. So I bought 2 of these and paired them as “front speakers” with the new update (I have the Fire Tv Cube). My only gripe is that the volume only goes to 10 which is fine for Amazon Music but when certainty shows or movies with action scenes come into play, it doesn’t sound as loud as I would like it. I plan on purchasing the Echo sub soon and maybe the 2 new Echo Studios when the funds are available. A little pricey at $199 each which output Dolby Atmos. Maybe by then more movies and tv shows will output in that format.",0

As in any electronics or computer device they have a few bugs that get worked out, the sound quality is great to me, and gets better every time they upgrade, I'm definitely not disappointed.

Using these buttons, especially in the dark, is a hit or miss proposition, especially since there are 4 of them, all the same size, so no way to distinguish by feel. The ring was not only more intuitive, but I always got the desired result. I know that volume can be adjusted by voice, but then you can’t hear the program material as Alexa changes the volume.

The sound is very good. The bass is surprisingly good and the mids and highs are excellent. I can't imagine getting better sound for the money ($59.99 on sale). The voice recognition works well in English. I haven't tried it in Spanish yet.,0

I have recently had to put my wife in a memory care facility, because she has dementia. I had hoped she could use the device, but it’s too complicated for her in her condition. She has no short-term memory at this time, and still can’t remember how to operate the device. Also, the change in volume level as music is played, frustrates her. At one moment it is too soft, at the next it is too loud. Too bad it doesn’t have AVC, Automatic volume control such as we have on radios.",0

What a major sound quality difference! This has become my go-to for music when I'm cooking, cleaning and in general doing anything that needs some motivation around the house. The bass is impressive for such a small thing - nice deep, non-fuzzing lows with some serious thump I actually felt on the floor. (The Echo is placed on my kitchen table) I ran through quite a gamut of music from Home Free, Post Malone, Star Wars instrumental, a little In This Moment and I was pleased with the quality of them all.If you see this lil puppy on sale - snap it right up!I can't wait to host a party and get this Echo bumpin'!",0

We mainly purchased this to play music throughout our home and was unaware there was a limit to “how many” echos connected together. As we purchased a package of 3 echos and a sub. The limit is said to be three, leaving us with a “rouge” echo. Still nice and for the money the sound is great for us. All in all it’s a good product we may just need to know better.",0

I called and after a bit they refunded my 30$ but did not and would not cover the overdrawn fee of 25$ the support person said she escalated my issue up a level and I have yet to hear back.

","December 3, 2019",Yes,I decided to upgrade to a newer version. I had two gen 1 echos which were still working well. I thought I would trade them in since these were on sale.

One thing I love is how she can add things to my shopping or to-do lists so easily and it goes right into the app. This helps when I lay awake at night unable to sleep because I know I need to make a list of things to do the next day... so I can get it quickly off my mind and go to bed.Well, I loved it so much I bought 2 echo dots.

It sounds broken, flat out. Tech support says this is normal. Nope, 1st gen did not do this garbage. That's not even the worst part. I use my echos as my preliminary music listening devices. I pay a premium for unlimited and HD music from Amaxon. Both of the latest gen echos I bought randomly disconnect ALL THE TIME and randomly stop playing music for no reason. They're supposed to be new tech, but honestly the 1st gen worked way more flawlessly. Major bugs and kinks that I have zero faith in Amazon addressing before they shove the newest gen dow your throat.",0

","December 29, 2019",Yes,I must say this is an excellent product. The sound and quality are superb! I would definitely buy more if I had a larger place. You can sync up anything on Amazon/Alexa/even bluetooth! The ability also to see what it would look like in your place was very very helpful!,0
5.0,"Couldn't be happier!
  
","January 7, 2020",Yes,Best Christmas gift I've gotten in years!.  Love the convenience of finding information.  Especially like listening to music.  Never expected the great sound quality.  Like the responsiveness to my voice even at a distance.  Will definitely purchase as gift for others.,0
5.0,"Quality Smart Speakers
  
","December 3, 2019",Yes,"The sound on this thing surprised me for its size. I keep the volume between 5-7 out of 10 max, and that's loud and clear enough to fill my medium-sized living roon. Alexa works great, and no complaints there. It would've been nice if it had an internal rechargeable battery, but also makes sense to keep it in your house plugged in the whole time.",0
2.0,"Can’t truly play in stereo with Bluetooth
  
","December 24, 2019",Yes,"Sounds quality is good. But I purchased so I can link them as is self described for the Echo. Stereo sounds basically. Well that worked, but if you are using Bluetooth to listen to music from your phone, it does not play on both Echo’s in stereo. It only plays on one. That needs to be redesigned.",0
5.0,"Pretty cool
  
","December 29, 2019",Yes,"Nothing is perfect really, but this is a pretty cool device. It actually does a lot more than I really thought. I got it as a gift for my husband who is super techie. It has a lot of cool features that we plan to take advantage of. I suggest putting it on its own network just so that it's more secure.",0
5.0,"Love it. Great sound.
  
","December 30, 2019",Yes,"Alexa is new to us. We couldn’t believe what great sound it gives us and how easy it is to use. Very impressed. So much so - that we got a second echo dot for our kitchen, a larger echo for the living room, an echo show 5” for our bedroom and an echo auto.",0
1.0,"Not Portable!
  
","December 11, 2019",Yes,Super disappointed! We upgraded our original Amazon Tap for the Echo. I was after a few of the features like drop-in and better sound BUT then I went to go grab Echo and bring her outside as I often do with my Tap and it DOESN'T WORK!!! I guess it has to be plugged in?!? I am SO SO disappointed.,0

5.0,"Easy to Use Easy to Install Broad Versatility
  
","January 10, 2020",Yes,This is my first Echo / Alexa unit. I found it easy to use and easy to install. The unit has broad capability and it seems that virtually all of the Smart Technology are scrambling  to get on the “Alexa Band Wagon” causing wider versatility in its ability.,0
5.0,"You need this
  
","January 4, 2020",Yes,There is absolutely NOTHING not to love about this echo. We use it allllll the time. For reminders. Lists. Music. Questions. Even calling my contacts in my phone. There's so much. Alexa has definitely made things easier for us. I recommend it to everyone.,0
5.0,"ALMOST on par with SONOS !
  
","December 4, 2019",Yes,"I have been a prime member for a good 3-4 years now and i’m just now starting to get into the Echo ecosystem. I recently visited a friends house with a SONOS system and was very impressed with the quality/immersion and how you can play music throughout the entire house. However, I did NOT want to spend upwards of a GRAND on a couple speakers. The Echo speakers are not only a fraction of what a SONOS system would cost, but they provide MORE features than the SONOS.Thanks Amazon you’ve done it again. Very happy with these smart speakers. It’s even better with the Echo Sub! ;)",0
5.0,"Great Sound
  
","January 12, 2020",Yes,"Using it mainly as a music system even though I know it can do much more. My favorite thing about it is if I have a song in my mnd, I can ask Alexa and hear the song immediately,  in most cases. Sometimes you have to be subscribed to their premium music service to hear a certain song.",0
3.0,"Disappointed
  
","December 20, 2019",Yes,"It doesn’t work as well as the one that I got previously, the sounds is not as good, I have to make more then one request of the same command. I’m not as happy with it as the one I got years ago.",1
4.0,"Nice Update; I miss twisting the volume ring.
  
","December 20, 2019",Yes,"Sounds pretty good.  I am looking forward to getting a Studio some time.  There was a bit of base rumble, but I put a few felt pads on the bottom and all is well.  I still prefer the volume ring, but I guess that I will get over it sometime.  I do like the size better than version 1.",0
5.0,"Echo in the house
  
","December 10, 2019",Yes,"The Echo is easy to set up and use. I started using it with Amazon Music, which comes with Amazon Prime, that I have not had the chance to use until now. Now I don't know how I could have lived without Echo for so long. Perfect Christmas gift for myself. Love it.",0
5.0,"A few quirks, but fine overall
  
","January 7, 2020",Yes,"This technology will continue to evolve and become easier to customize.  I use it mostly to play SiriusXM in the house without the need for a second subscription or equipment.  Every now and then Alexa doesn't quite understand some request, but nothing major.  You can't expect it to know much past its programming.",0
2.0,"No battery = no fun.
  
","January 3, 2020",Yes,"I had an earlier Alexa product that I loved.  Once it was uncharged I could unplug it and carry it around the house with me.  I used it for music and news, mostly, as well as occasional info queries.  I am disappointed with this new Echo.  It has much better sound quality than the old one.  But it is bulky and heavy and does not have a battery.  So I find myself rarely using it.  When I do unplug it and carry it to a new outlet, it takes too long to charge up and become responsive.  I will need to get a battery attachment, but that will only add more bulk &amp; weight -- and cost!",0
5.0,"Happy with the purchase
  
","December 3, 2019",Yes,Great value and works excellent.  Bought this to replace our echo dot in the living room and we are pleased with the upgrade.  I love that it is still small and compact and can fit on our shelf.  The mic seems to be more responsive than the echo dot also.,0

","January 2, 2020",Yes,"Nice color choices, and I like the new size/form-factor as well. I have one of each gen, including the dots, and this has the best sound in my opinion. It has less fullness than the Sonos One I also have, but still nice in a small-to-mid sized room.",0
5.0,"How did I do without Alexa???
  
","January 12, 2020",Yes,"Alexa was exactly as described.  The sound quality is outstanding.  I've already created Playlists, Reminders and directions, i.e., ""Alexa, turn off the Living Room Lights"".  Alexa is fabulous.  I don't know how I did without her for so long.  I'm still expanding her capabilities.",0
4.0,"Big improvement over the Echo Dot.
  
","December 11, 2019",Yes,Music sounds much better than the echo dot.  You can actually hear the base notes and the sound doesn't break up much at all.  I do hear more distortion on the echo dot.  We have this in the kitchen and the carries very well throughout the first floor.  I gave it 4 stars since I am looking for even better sound.  Would need a bigger system for that.,1
1.0,"Cant connect any devices
  
","December 3, 2019",Yes,"I cant get it to connect. I also have google home and it took 60 seconds to download the app, connect to bluetooth, and use. I've been trying with thisnalwxa for 30 minutes and all it does is load.",1
5.0,"Love the color!
  
","January 6, 2020",Yes,"This is our 5th Alexa product.  We are hooked!  I've also gifted Alexa devices to 5 different people.  Once you have it, you'll never know how you did without.  If you are concerned with security, turn off the microphone when you're not using it.",0
3.0,"Great speaker with a serious flaw.
  
","December 24, 2019",Yes,"The sound quality is excellent and the Alexa function is great. However, there is one serious flaw of the echo. When playing music over Bluetooth, the volume is extremely low. It needs to turn all the way up to have a reasonable volume for music. But by then, the Alexa volume is way too loud. Sadly, there is no way to sync the volume level of the music and Alexa. Another minor glitch is when playing amazon music to stereo pair of echo, there is always a few seconds of noise before the music starts. It would be to mute them before the music starts.",0
4.0,"Good speaker
  
","December 30, 2019",Yes,"Definitely an upgrade in sound quality from my Echo first generation. I was expecting a little more low end from the speaker, but it's not bad. Also does not respond as easily as Gen one, so I have to speak louder, but not bad at all. I love the look and ease to set up. Currently considering the Echo Studio.",0
5.0,"Nice improvement over the Echo 1.  The sound has more depth and richness.
  
","October 22, 2019",Yes,The new Echo has a much deeper and richer sound than the original Echo.  It was very easy to connect with my WiFi  We switched from black to twilight Blue and prefer the new look.  Very happy.  What I would like to see is for the App to be more user friendly and intuitive.,0

5.0,"It records us.
  
","December 23, 2019",Yes,"The speaker works as described.  But, I unplug it when not in use.  I understand that it records your conversations.  And, you have no way to delete or access what it records.  Can we believe that little red button keeps it from recording us?",0

3.0,"unreliable
  
","January 5, 2020",Yes,"When I first got this item as a gift, I thought it was really cool.  A few days later, Alexa did not respond to my voice at all.  The lights came on but shut off immediately after I asked her to play some music.  Last night, I asked her to play a specific artist.  She stated that she could not unless I pay, but she could play something similar.  The entire hour she played something similar, the music was static, and came in and out.  Have called my son several times since he gave me the item as a gift.  He said he didn't know why the item would be acting up.  No longer amused by this item.",0
5.0,"Works great
  
","January 7, 2020",Yes,We got this for my mom for Christmas because she has vision problems and it was hard for her to see the time and with this she can ask her what time it is and any other information that she needs that she can’t really see to find out. She loves it she’s always asking it questions and playing music on it.,0

","October 19, 2019",Yes,This sound quality is solid and is exactly the improvements that were needed from previous generations.,2
5.0,"Good, but the Amazon streaming still has issues.
  
","December 6, 2019",Yes,"Impressive sound. Bought as Echo Dot replacements in 2 rooms. The old tinning and low volume of those Dots were killing me. These give much better bass and treble, seemingly better than my 2nd Gen Echos.However, if Amazon can't keep these things from randomly stopping my music streaming for no reason, I will be replacing all 7 with Google's home!!!! devices.",0
5.0,"AMAZING!!! Love Alexa!
  
","January 8, 2020",Yes,"If you don't have an Alexa you're missing out. Shes super handy and great at reminding me about everything! She's also super helpful in the kitchen. She helps you with timers, conversions, recipe place holders, etc. She also plays great music anytime you ask her! I would say my most favorite feature is the Good Morning Alexa command that I set up. She turns on the lights and goes through a set of tasks that I made her do.",0
5.0,"The best yet!
  
","December 12, 2019",Yes,The sound quality when combined with Amazon music is absolutely top shelf. I usually purchase bose speakers but I must say this is same as or greater than in quality! My advice is that after you buy it you go into the settings and tweet the bass up just a bit.,0
5.0,"Nice upgrade from original Echo
  
","January 6, 2020",Yes,Sound quality is much better. The form factor is more attractive . All the great functionality with more features added daily is great. Pair this device with AnyList for keeping lists for groceries and tasks across all your Apple devices,0

","December 23, 2019",Yes,"Looks cool in blue with white controls.  Overall very good sound, Base is good, you can ""feel"" as well as hear the power.  The voice command feature doesn't seem to pick up my voice as effectively as 2nd generation Echo does.  Doesn't seem to get my requests as accurately either.  Overall fun device though, with good sound.  It's been cool to ""pair"" the 2nd and 3rd gen Echo in different rooms in an ""everything"" group for sound that fills the house with great sounding background music.  Not to mention the endless other features and skills these devices have.",0

","January 7, 2020",Yes,"Absolutely love this when it’s working properly! It has great sound when working but there are sometimes volume issues (Music volume is almost silent when all the way turned up but then Alexa voice is extremely loud) . I’ve also had issues with the lights on the Alexa. They consistently stay on even when I’m not talking to her and also when there are no notifications. After leaving unplugged for a few hours it comes back on and works fine, I just wish I didn’t have to keep resetting it. It will sometimes go a day or more without working properly.",0
5.0,"Echo Set Up
  
","December 18, 2019",Yes,"The echo will do alot of things.  The most important things has to be programmed into it.  Programming it isn't the easiest thing to do.

","January 2, 2020",Yes,"Sound is very good for size of the device. Can make some adjustments to sound with equalizer on app.  Cons: 1-volume slider on app disappeared, so I have to either ask Alexa to lower the volume of the echo plus or manually adjust the volume. 2- can't listen to movies with two paired echo plus devices. You can only use one speaker when playing videos or watching movies.",0

","December 8, 2019",Yes,"Love the blue color but I wish Alexa had MORE options in sound volume. If Alexa is too loud and I say ""Alexz lower volume slightly"" or by only one decimal then Alexa volume drops way too low. This is VERY disappointing.",0

","December 26, 2019",Yes,"I purchased this echo to add another in my living room.  I have three speakers that are linked in the house, now.  The sound is good and I like the ability to play music On the main floor of the house with my voice.",0

","January 2, 2020",Yes,I ordered 2 Echo's to use as wireless speakers in my retail showroom and ended up switching to JBL Flip instead.

","December 8, 2019",Yes,The sound coming from the speaker most of the time is exceptional.  However the base in some jazz music is a loud buzz.  Sounds like a wire is loose from the speaker face.  I know that is not possible because this is an electronic speaker.,0

It’s pretty loud, and Alexa can hear me from distances I thought she wouldn’t be able to. I also really like the mute mic button! I don’t like that you have to pay for music apps if you want to play certain songs, but I knew that before I bought it. Of course that’s not Alexas fault either.",0

1.0,"Worst alexa device I have bought
  
","November 25, 2019",No,"I already have four Alexas; one previous generation and three dots scattered all over my house. The 2nd generation dots are really nice, and so I thought I'd go with the better sound and latest upgrade for Alexa. The setup was absolutely a dream, and she was up and running in no time. Really liked the better sound, too. But then all of a sudden we began to notice she was just getting too chatty, always asking us if we wanted to do this thing or that thing and THEN...she began asking us if we wanted to be referred to other things to buy! REALLY? I finally found a place in the Alexa app to make her less chatty, but then we noticed that there was a random ""Bloop"", or ""Bloop-bloop."" sound just out of the blue until it was driving us nuts. Not all that often, but way more often than we could stand. Then, the final straw. I have my four alexa devices scattered throughout my house and in a group, so I can just tell Alexa to play some music on all the devices and I'll have music throughout the house. Well, she suddenly just took it upon herself to drop right out of the group! Suddenly, when I told her to play music throughout the house, she would do so, but only on the Alexas that weren't in the main room. THAT'S IT!  I packaged her up and sent her back and wrote this review. I really only want her to answer the questions I ask and not embellish and give me a life history or ask me if I want to go other places. I'm glad I still have my old Alexa. I hooked her back up again and while she may not sound quite as good, she's a lot easier to live with, AND she works, too.",4

","November 24, 2019",No,"As Amazon added new features, they gradually got to the point where they decided to make the Echo You're folksy companion rather than a machine for automation and hands-free work. I turned on brief mode because I don't want a 5-minute conversation when I'm just trying to check the weather or turn on the lights. It didn't work. I still get it to tell me to have a nice day instead of the basic tone it's supposed to play, and sometimes it tries to tell me about new features I don't need when I just want it to read the weather.Sometimes I find it listening after picking up on a word like Election.  This is especially annoying when I'm having a conversation and it chimes in about how it came help me with that.I have both Google and Amazon devices, but I'll be replacing the Amazon ones this year because of the broken features.Update: An Amazon representative contacted me and we spoke about the issues I've experienced. He mentioned that one of them could be resolved by a setting in the app, so it should no longer try to tell me about new features.  I'm actually only updating my review to say that a TV show said ""sure,"" and the Echo just responded to the TV to tell it about Sure brand deodorant. I've unplugged the Echo for now.  We call this a ""time out.""",3

The price is lower (Black Friday had a nice discount) and the unit is a bit smaller than the first-generation. I've come to rely on her for timers while cooking, reminders for every day stuff, alarms for those times I need to set a non-standard alarm (catch a plane for example), etc.  I love the lists  I have one for Walmart, groceries, Costco, Sams Club. It makes shopping so much easier to just be able to add X to the grocery list right when you run out.  A must-have to turn on lights in the house. Great to ask ""How old is Actor X"" when you see them in a movie.  The A-Lady has become an important part of the family - glad to be sharing the experience with my daughters.",1

","December 27, 2019",No,"I purchased this Gen 3 speaker yeaterday. I have two others, the Tap and the Original Echo that I am generally pleased with. The Gen 3 was for a special purpose, I needed to connect a wired Audio source to it. After checking the specifications, I see it has a Line-In. Actually, its a Line-In / Line-Out connection configurable in software or supposed to be.After setting up, I proceeded to connect the Line-In (Aux) and opened the Alexa app on my iPhone. I found the Line-In/Line-Out switch and changed it to Line-In. At this point, the app crashed and said something went wrong. It would just refresh the screen not allowing you to toggle the Aux to Line-In. After reading some old reviews, I learned about a problem with the iOS app. So, I had an Android tablet around, I opened the Alexa app on it and found the Line-In switch. Again, I activate it. The app did not crash this time but no audio came out.I contacted Amazon device support who franly did not know what Line-In or Aux was. After 10 minutes of wasted time on chat, the CS person came back with ""That device does not support Line-IN"". I refered him to the current listing which lists Line-In as a feature.The device was returned to the store as Faulty. Today, I purchased an Awsome Ears Boom 2LE from a local brick and mortar store and WOW, what a device. A smart app that works, Line-In that works, sound that is far better than the current echo's, and a useful equalizer to customize the speakers tonal quality. $60.",0

And in that respect, it sucks. I've had more arguments with Alexa about what music it is I'm trying to listen to than I ever imagined possible. And then when it finally (if ever) gets to the type of playlist I'm looking for, the playlist gets so repetitive after a few listens I can predict the songs coming up. It honestly got so bad I pulled out my old 3-CD changer stereo and hooked that up for listening to music while I get ready for work in the morning. You can't tell Alexa to not play certain songs or bands, nor can you go into your Amazon account to request the same (a feature that seems easy to implement, but Amazon certainly hasn't since I mentioned it to them over a year ago). The only credit I can give the echo is it has decent sound, but considering it's lack of functionality and poor AI, I'll stick with an old school home stereo and a music service through my phone.",0

The sound quality was good whenever I play music, but I just think it is 100% important for people to have this device to realize that nothing should be said that you would not say in front of the world. If you don’t have a problem with that then I suggest you get this product. I have to say that it is really cool to be able to turn on and off your lights and other appliances with this device.

I would give 6 stars for that.However there are so many things making the Alexa echo annoying, that should be fixed:- the voice recognition is awful when you are used to Google- Most of the time say something, Alexa will answer ""I don't know"". It is faster to use the thermostat app to set the AC than to talk to Alexa- Playing music from the app is a nightmare (it only works through the desktop alexa website) and you need a paid service to play the music you want- The stereo sound does not work in bluetooth- There should be more Alexa integration in IFTT You cannot control Alexa as a Then clause",1

Sometimes I hear it making that same announcement from the other room when I'm not even using it.  It would be great if they could create a setting that replaces this and all vocal response with a simple series of light flashes.  Ultimately I like this little speaker but this random yelling out issue has got me close to unplugging it.  I just turned on Brief Mode under vocal responses to see if that helps.

Not so much the device but the amazon music service really sucks imo for a big reason. Now originally I just had this echo and signed up for amazon music unlimited, and for a while it was fantastic ! A few months later I got my hands on a new amazon tap speaker thinking it would be really great to have a speaker play at each side of my room for a more stereo sound. I synced up my new tap to my account , made a speaker group for both devices , requested a song to play and was greeted with “sorry to play this song on this group of speakers you need to upgrade your music plan” Wait what?! In order for me to use more than one speaker in my one room I need to pay more money? I looked up more info and sure enough yah , you need to pay more money to have the SAME song play one MORE THAN ONE device. Kinda bull shyt  if you ask me. Well just keep that in mind if you plan on buying more than one for expanded sound. That said , some songs play on both with no problem and other times it says I need to pay for an up grade.

Even trying to play music over Amazon Music can be painful thanks to the problematic speech recognition - it's pretty good for basic use, but for album and song titles it's extremely flaky.

","January 8, 2020",Yes,"This is an excellent product---3rd generation has even better sound quality than 2nd Gen. BUT, I was expecting RED, and the color is more an orange/coral, and NOT a true (fire engine) red; it has much more an dark orange appearance, with a white top (dirty fingerprints magnet) and a white plug and cord. I think this should be a true red if it's being sold as such, and should be also offered with a black top/cord/plug as an option. I gave mine to a friend, and he bought me a 3rd Gen in Charcoal, which is my preferred color. Had this been a TRUE RED, I would have hung onto it. If you like an orangey/coral color---go for it; just know that a ""conceptual"" design of red, and what actually ships are two different things. Also, I wish Amazon would add a speaker mute button; you can mute the microphone, but if your phone rings or something else requires you to want Alexa to stop making noise, you have to tell her to be quiet or pause; a speaker mute button would be nice. I suppose you could use the (-) volume control to turn her all the way down, but a quick and easy mute button would be faster and easier! Love this unit -- just not what they call ""red.""",0

I have a total of 3 now. All in all they are all very good. My original Echo and this latest one have a very good sound to them. I believe the concept behind them is good, but they need refinement as sometimes I ask a question to which I receive a sensible answer another time I'll ask the same question and I'll get something like I don't know",0

","January 4, 2020",Yes,"Really brings you into the modern world and blows your mind away.  This is the first device I’ve ever known that actually feels like another person is in the room.  The ai is amazing and the voice response sounds so human and not robotic.  While the sound quality is much better than your typical speaker, it’s not studio quality.  It sure is loud though which is great.  You can naturally talk to it using phrases like “ok enough” when you want to stop an action.  You don’t have to talk to it like it’s a robot and worry about saying the “right commands”.  It understands you and just works.  I’ve bought 5 of them in the past week lol, and the studio is on its way tomorrow.  It also works flawlessly with the smart device in my home",0

","January 6, 2020",Yes,"I bought the Echo and Sub combination, and we really like the sound quality of this system. We're still training Alexa, but so far, she appears to be behaving well.
