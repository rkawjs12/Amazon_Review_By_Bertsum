1.0,"Disappointing
  
","April 7, 2019",Yes,So I get this phone. and I'm very disappointed. not with the phone. the phone is amazing and does everything I like plus more. but I never got the wireless earbuds that everyone else gets with theres. and then the charger port I cant use because it's for a different country. so now I cant enjoy fast charge and it sucks. do not buy this phone online. go to a store,69
3.0,"Here is the deal..
  
","June 17, 2019",Yes,"So this phone is not fake as some are claiming in these reviews. But also the phone DOES NOT have official Samsung warranty IN THE USA as the seller misled me to think in his answer to this question. Mine comes from Singapore, if I need to fix it, it is fixable only in that country as Samsung rep explained. This is a real Samsung Galaxy S10+, brand new, working perfectly fine. However, this is the international model. it is not under warranty in the US and it is not even fixable in the US because the parts are different. It does not have The American Qualcomm Snapdragon Octa-core processor, it has an equivalent Samsung processor Exynos 9820 (8 nm).  Don't know the difference in performance but the rear camera quality is really disappointing. Could be because the CPU processes pictures differently as I have seen amazing S10+ pictures unlike the ones this phone takes. All five cameras are working fine (tested)The 3 stars are for the misleading product description.",45
5.0,"Real device, really great product upgrade
  
","April 20, 2019",Yes,"Upgraded from the Note8 to this phone, the S10+, and I really enjoy using it. Transition was seamless, and the experience of usage is great and what you would expect of a flagship. The camera quality, and capabilities, are great. I actually enjoy using this phone more than my usage of my Note8. Definitely recommend the upgrade if you are on an 8th generation or earlier.Box came with serial number stickers, charging block (European connection), USB-C cable, USB-C to USB-A adapter, AKG headphones, a clear case, and paperwork. I did not put on the case on or use it at all, but I would say that it would only be good for small bumps and scratches, definitely not drops.I have purchased two cases, the Spigen Rugged Armor (thin protective case) and an Encased belt clip designed for that case (which is a nice combination). The second case I purchased is the Otterbox Defender, which I haven't received or used yet, but I'm looking forward to using it based on the reviews of others on YouTube.Incase you are wondering, it is the real thing, came to me brand new in the plastic wrap, with the Samsung manufacturer's seal unbroken.",40

5.0,"Amazing phone!
  
","May 11, 2019",Yes,"I can not stress to someone who is thinking about purchasing this phone, how much I absolutely love mine! This is hands down, the best phone I've ever had. This is a little strange of Samsung because they are dabbling with technology in this phone that really hasn't been used ever so there are some kinks. For instance, the fingerprint reader is not the best in the world, they honestly would have been better off with an optical in-screen scanner like the ones on the oneplus 6T in my opinion. The facial recognition isnt the greatest but it's very decent. I understand they had to sacrifice hefty more accurate components for more screen real estate and that is honestly a sacrifice I'm willing to make. This phone is the fastest peace of technology I've ever seen, its ridiculous. Snap 855 and 8gb of ram, you cant beat it! I enjoy the attempts at pursuing new tech and this phone to me, is an embodiment of that. I hope the tech gets better, but I won't see it for another 5 years at this price!",21

","November 8, 2019",Yes,"I upgraded from a S7 Activate, I was researching the iphonex,  Huawei m30 pro and this Samsung s10+. My no.1 reason for choosing a phone would be the camera. I chose this S10+ cause I thought it had it all, better applications compared to iPhone which are very limited, I know for a fact iphone cameras are good also the p30 pro but I saw others say that this camera was also a good one.I received the phone well packaged, brand new etcHowever the camera is a little overrateded. My s7 took almost the same pics and maybe even better.My advise you'll be disappointed to invest in this phone thinking it's as good as the other 2.I'm disappointed I live in the Caribbean so to return this will be difficult.The camera isn't that good.

I know from the beginning what I was buying and what to expect and I'm not dissapointed. I'm happy with my new phone.

It is frustrating.For phone cleaning feature, you got to download certain app to clean it. It seems not a user friendly phone.

1.0,"Fingerprint scanner DOES NOT WORK
  
","March 18, 2019",No,"I bought this phone with very high hopes. Unfortunately, the fingerprint scanner absolutely, positively DOES NOT WORK. At all. Samsung rolled out a software update to correct this issue. It didn't work. Then they recommended you input the same fingerprint twice to increase the chances of success. That didn't work either. Then they said the fingerprint scanner will not work with a screen protector? Ummm... what? The phone comes with a screen protector on it. Anybody that uses their phone knows the importance of a screen protector to protect against scratches. Most people's phones will be all scratched up within a month if they don't use a screen protector. Also, removing the screen protector didn't help anyway. Then, Samsung said the fingerprint scanner ""will improve in time."" What does that even mean?This phone also comes equipped with facial recognition technology. The problem is, any photo of yourself whether on paper or another device will fool this phone. Even somebody that looks like you can fool the phone. There are videos all over YouTube of people doing this. Check them out.That leaves punching in a PIN number every time you want to check your phone. This isn't 2012. Nobody wants to do that anymore. It's a hassle.I returned this phone and got the Apple XS Max and it is sooo much better than this. Do yourself a favor and skip this phone.",15

","June 1, 2019",No,This phone was a gift for me to replace my Samsung Note 4 which worked very satisfactorily for 4+ years.  I hope that my new S10+ will give me equal or better service.  I was really amazed to see the features of this phone.  Very impressive.  All worked well except fingerprint reader!  I bought and installed a hard glass screen protector.  That may have contributed to the problem with the fingerprint reader.  I just turned it off and I am losing its functionality.  My service provider said that there will be a software update soon and it will fix it.  Overall the phone is very good!,0

5.0,"Apple defector and not looking back!
  
","March 8, 2019",No,"I’m a decade-plus iPhone user who finally got tired of the ridiculous pricing scheme with those phones.  I was on the fence about the S10+ but a few things won me over.  First, the price was roughly 40% less than the equivalent Xs Max (taking into account all discounts and specials for both phones).  The design is outstanding.  This is a very attractive phone. I have the prism black.  I initially pondered the prism white but the color shift when illuminated by bright light is a little too pink and purplish for my tastes.  Although I’m not a huge fan of the dual pinhole front cameras, they don’t bother me either.  The dual front cameras and rear cameras were a major part of the reason I went with the S10+ instead of the S10.  The rear cameras are what really sold me on the phone, particularly the wide-angle.  Speed of the Android OS and UI on the Galaxy is not only up to par with iOS but in many cases, seems snappier, especially web browsing.  Honestly, about the only things I think iOS does decidedly better are Animoji and facial recognition.  I stopped using animojis almost immediately after the initial wow factor wore off.  That took less than a day.  I also prefer fingerprint unlocking over facial anyhow.  I never warmed up to facial recognition.  It’s fine for singles and people who don’t share their phone.  But for married users like me who frequently accesses a spouse’s device, it’s much more inconvenient than fingerprint registration.  Samsung has both, along with a PIN option like iOS.  However, Samsung also has other options as well, like drawing a pattern.The last time I attempted to leave the Apple ecosystem, I purchased a Note 8.  It didn’t work because  believe both the timing and phone were wrong.  The Note was overkill coming from iOS and iOS still had a slight UI advantage over Android.  The S10+ feels much more intuitive and easier to use than the Note.  There’s no S pen but I never used it beyond the first day.  The gorgeous screen, snappy OS, insanely nice cameras, enhanced security, pocket-friendly price and numerous other nice features of the S10 made this a super easy decision for me.  Sure, I’ll miss a few things about iOS… very few. But I’m LOVING this S10 right now!",69
1.0,"this is not a United States product ONLY RATED ONE STAR SINCE NO STARS WAS NOT AN OPTION
  
","June 19, 2019",Yes,"This phone is made for use by United Arab Emirates and does not have all the current Samsung USA selections like wi-fi calling.  It is actually sold thru a 3rd party Seller, Technomaster which provides no stateside contact number, but rather only an e-mail  for any assistance.  Samsung USA indicated they would not support this product if there were any issues, nor would it be covered by the FCC. It says international, but no further info is provided.Penalties for not returning the phone within 15 days  and the restock fee are steep, especially when you are working with Amazon Customer Service, my AT&amp;T service provider, and Samsung Customer Service.I returned the phone to Technomaster in MA, but was charged a 20% of cost restocking fee.DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE.  THE COST IS APPEALING, BUT YOU WILL LOSE MONEY IN THE END, AND IT WILL NOT BE SUPPORTED BY SAMSUNG USA.",8
3.0,"My favourite phone to date! But the camera..
  
","March 29, 2019",Yes,"First and foremost I love the screen, big beautiful and crisp. It makes consuming media such a pleasurable experience! The size of the phone is a bit big otherwise lol, but you can make it work using the one handed operations quite easily..Battery life is definitely another win, I get through a full day consistently with 50-40 percent left before I go to bed around 11,with moderate usage (YouTube and Netflix watching, social media etc.)So of course the camera. Toting 5 lenses you'd think it would be amazing, but it's a big let down, at least to me. The options are many but the image quality is subpar; don't know what's going on with the image processing, but my nexus 6p of 3 + years ago still takes much better pictures. They may seem good on the surface but as soon as u zoom in, even a little bit, on a picture you took, it looks bad.It mars an otherwise perfect phone.",6

","July 31, 2019",No,"I had high hopes for the phone given all the high end specs, so I will not revise its strong sides and will mention flaws instead. The finger print sensor is a very bad, bad design. The mere fact that there are dedicated videos on YouTube teaching people how to improve its functionality speaks for itself. My 2.5 yr old LG V20 works with 99.99% precision with its sensor in the back. I was thinking to switch for a better camera and faster processor but alas, I'm keeping my old proven workhorse instead. Another flaw I noticed was that the sound on the other line during a conversation was not as good as one of LG, it was more tinny and muddy. Needless to say greatly disappointed I sent it back and plan to buy no more Samsung product ever again.",1
