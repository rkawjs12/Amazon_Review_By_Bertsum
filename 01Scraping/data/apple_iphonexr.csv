","August 13, 2019",Yes,"My phone is amazing! Obviously I’d show it if I wasn’t on it right now. I waited a few days before making this review so I could make sure no quirks popped up.First of all this is the best battery life I’ve ever had on a phone EVER. I went out for 8 hours and came home and my phone was on 74% at the end of the day. Same thing with school. My phone was at about 50% at the end of the school day. Now it charges pretty slowly in my opinion but the slow charging is definitely worth the battery.Size wise the phone is pretty big. It is a handful to hold and hard to throw in my pocket. The screen size is beautiful for watching videos and doing digital stuff but the phone is just a little big.The software works perfectly. The touch is fine, Face ID is incredibly fast and accurate, and it opens apps very fast. It also responds really well to my touch. My last phone did not.The speaker is amazing. It’s so loud that I didn’t even need my speaker in the shower. The phone was loud enough by itself. I took a call in a room full of noisy kids and my dad said he couldn’t even really hear them. So they cancel noise. Microphone is good. I can say “hey Siri” quietly and it’ll activate.Overall I’m really impressed. I was very nervous looking at other reviews but my phone is working so perfectly right now. I am definitely satisfied especially with paying $200 less than apple was charging.Then again I upgraded from a cracked 6s so that could be the reason I’m so over the moon haha",18

","September 6, 2019",Yes,"So my wife was in the market for a new iPhone, upgrading from her iPhone 6, which was now obsolete according to several required apps she uses for work. I couldn't bring myself to pay Apple 800 dollars or more for a new basic phone. I tried to get my wife to agree to an Android and that wasn't going to happen. Then I found these Amazon Renewed phones. I wound up saving about 175 dollars on an almost new iPhone Xr.The phone was delivered when it said it would be delivered and does appear as new as possible, less the original packaging and equipment. The box was a repackage box, the power adapter was an unknown USB wall charger and the cable was a lightning cable although it had a crack in the lightning plug housing so it will last about a week.The migration from old phone to new phone took about an hour, with an iOS upgrade in for good measure (this phone came with 12.2 and 12.4 has been out for only a few weeks so it is close to current).Overall, happy about the phone.

","July 25, 2019",Yes,"Boo yah! My phone came in mint condition with an Apple charger.Something people need to know about newer iPhones is the materials have changed. Opposed to older models that were more scratch resistant but more prone to shattering when dropped, the newer models traded in the scratch resistance factor for higher durability and less likelihood of shattering occurring. There’s a coating on it and yes, you will ABSOLUTELY need not only a proper case for this phone, but also a screen protector. I did not know this until after purchasing this phone and noticed some minor cosmetic scratches from my light usage.My unsolicited advice if buying is to also purchase a case and screen protector simultaneously so you don’t have to deal with scratching. Both can be found on Amazon together for under $20 total.Unless you’re totally rich and don’t care. Then do whatever you want because this is probably your back up back up iPhone.",3

Because of my issues is the only reason I give this review a 4 stars. I would recommend that if you purchase this phone make sure that you purchase a case and a screen protector because you don’t want to lose your investment it’s just that beautiful.

I go all day with using various apps and phone calls and even use it with the controller while flying my drone. At bedtime, around 1:00am, I still have about 50% battery left from the charge the night before. The only thing weird is the iPhone podcast app does not work. It says ""There is a problem and the Podcast Library needs to be rebuilt before continuing."" When I click Rebuild Library, it never finishes doing anything. I have even kept touching the screen to keep the phone from going to sleep in hopes that the rebuild would be successful. I eventually deleted the app and re-downloaded it from the App Store.

","December 5, 2019",Yes,"I know the idea of a ""renewed"" or ""refurbished"" phone may seem scary to some people. I was really worried before I bought this.  I couldn't believe the deal I got getting this phone and thought it was too good to be true and I'd have to deal with a faulty device. Well, boy was I proven wrong! My phone came fully unlocked as it stated and all I had to do was pop my Sim Card from my iPhone 6 into this iPhone XR and it worked! It started the setup process immediately. All apps work, calling, texting, settings, are working. I am really glad I took a chance on getting this phone to save a couple hundred dollars on a newer model. If you're considering getting this phone, GET IT. You won't be disappointed.",2

3.0,"Speaker Issue
  
","December 9, 2019",Yes,"The phone looked great!  A couple of surface scratches on the top right of the screen, but that's to be expected I guess with a used phone.  I wasn't really concerned with those small issues. I transferred everything from my old phone and completely set up the new phone and everything was great!  I was soooo excited and felt really great about my purchase,.....until I made a call.  It wasn't until I had invested several hours into the new phone that I realized the ear speaker has a shattery sound and makes it difficult to hear the other person on the call.  The speaker does technically work, but the voice sounds muffled and shattered, like an old busted car speaker.  I really hate it because I like the phone and spent so much time setting everything up to be personalized to me.  If I new the quality of the speaker before hand, I would have returned it immediately, but at this point I think I will just deal with it.  I don't like change and it took me forever to upgrade from an Iphone 5S (crystal clear speaker btw) to the XR, and unfortunately it was just a bad experience because of the speaker issue.  The phone is excellent other than this one issue, but a key feature of the a phone is to have conversations with others right?  I needed this phone for my personal and business use, so I hope the speaker doesn't continue to degrade.I'm not sure how the company tests for sound quality and clarity, but I would encourage everyone if you decide to purchase a used phone, call someone on the phone first before personalizing it to you.",1

It is fully unlocked, I just had to go to Metro for a new SIM (could have used my current SIM but it would have cost $17.99 to change devices so I got a new one).

So to get a good grip to switch the display on/off you can also press the volume down button then that takes a screen shot.

It does indeed have a 1080p resolution screen. After getting to level 19 in hole.io the amount of objects loading and your hole’s size started were what I believe started the temperature of the phone to raise. Battery life is very useful, it can last the whole time your awake (7-14hours) on 50% brightness. In fact, i’m using it right now to write this review. My only real complaint is the price, most iPhones are very expensive, but for the newest model iPhone this is pretty cheap.",1

","December 15, 2019",Yes,"I figured with the description of such slight defects that may be acceptable by Amazon for a refurbished iPhone XR it would be worth it to save $99 by ordering a refurbished for $500 rather than order a brand new one from Apple for $599.When I first opened the box, updated the phone and got it set up with my apps, everything was great. Then I went to the Apple store to buy a screen protector and some other accessories. When I was putting on the screen protector I noticed a crack which runs almost the entire length of the screen. It appears the seller buffed this and possibly used a glass filler to hide the cracked screen. I’ve taken photos to share.I ordered this phone as I’m traveling and needed a new phone. Well I have no choice but to eat this scam by Amazon and the seller because I’m traveling and don’t have an option to not use this phone.Amazon should require high quality photos of actual products on sale.

5.0,"Great Phone
  
","September 27, 2019",No,"Being a teenager and being very involved in my phone having a good phone is very important. Having the iPhone XR fulfills all those teenage needs. It does this by having outstanding battery life, it is inexpensive, and it has an amazing display. All these reasons support why I think it's the best phone on the market right now. My first reason to why this is such a good phone is that the XR has amazing battery life. Being a teenager I am on my phone a lot maybe sometimes a little too much but my major use of my cellphone is no match for the battery life of the XR. As long as I have my phone at 100 percent in the morning when I wake up you can be sure that it will last me the entire day. And even on the days that I forget to charge it during the night that's perfectly fine because it only takes 30 minutes for the phone to get 50 percent back. This is so important for many people not just teenagers but for people like business owners or other working adults because you don't always have to worry about charging your phone because you know that you have plenty of battery left. My next reason is that it is inexpensive. For a good cell phone prices can go from $600up to prices of $1000. For many 800, 900, and even 1000 dollars is a little too much to spend and the XR is a great compromise between those at its affordable price of $750. This is great for people who want an iPhone but don't want to pay the huge price tags that come with some of these phones. Lastly the XR has an amazing display. The screen like the X and the iPhone 11 has no home button and it extends up past the selfie camera. This is great because it utilizes the entire phone for the screen. I use this all the time for things like watching Netflix and YouTube, and playing games. Also, the screen is super clear and has a great resolution. For 3 years I had the iPhone 6 and last year my family got a new plan, so we all got new phones. So when I got my XR I could notice right away the amazing quality of the screen and how much of a difference it is from the earlier generations. To conclude, I believe that the XR is the best phone on the market because of the 3 main reasons. 1 its long-lasting and fast charging battery, 2 it's very affordable price that is great compared to other generations of the iPhone and 3 its outstanding display. I hope by reading this review you will know how great this phone is.",1

If you’re using a metro pcs phone then you’ll have to contact metro pcs so they can switch your service from your old phone to your new phone. It’ll be a $15 fee but should work within minutes,6

","September 3, 2019",Yes,"Edit: unfortunately I've had to send the phone back as it seems to be having battery issues. The battery indicator would sometimes not update when charging and sometimes seem stuck until I restarted the phone. Sigh, oh well.I was a bit skeptical about buying a refurbished phone but I decided to give it a try. My phone came from the seller Chubbiestech.The box contained the phone, a lightning cable, a charger and a sim eject tool. The phone also came with a glass screen protector already installed.Pulling the phone out of the little clear plastic bag and looking over it carefully, it was flawless, no scratches, scuffs or anything it looked very much new.After I set the phone up I decided to check the battery health and capacity as in the description for the amazon refurbished phones ,it says the battery health may be around 80%. Well to my surprise this one showed the battery at 100% capacity so yeah this phone is practically new.So if you’re thinking of buying one give it a shot.",1

","July 16, 2019",Yes,I dont like iphones. Having to pay for common apps makes know sense to me. Having to put your password in for everything makes know sense to me. I think this phone is to time consuming. Im about to send it back. I brought a sim card from Sprint and its taking me almost a week to get the right sim from Sprint. I have not even had the chance to use the phone. Still not activated.,2

There is also a “void” sticker next to the charging port. Not sure if the phone was meant to be tossed or not. For the $500+ spent on this phone and additional money that will come out of my pocket to fix the speaker, it’s best to buy new!

1.0,"APPLE CONTROLS what you can do with YOUR OWN phone, pictures, music, media, etc.
  
","November 25, 2019",No,"In Mother Russia, you don't control your phone, your PHONE controls YOU!  Oh wait it's your Iphone / Apple.  Yes, you purchased it but you don't really own it, Apple does!Thinking of ""upgrading"" from and Android to the fancy Iphone label &amp; joining the hype?  I suggest you carefully reconsider.  The OS locks down your phone and what you are able to do with it is EXTREMELY LIMITED.  Where you used to have freedom and multiple options with how you stored, transferred, managed, and enjoyed your own music, picture, videos, media, etc., Apple locks that all down and takes the control away from you.  You only get 1 or 2 options which are all extremely limited in function, and Apple and users call that ""Streamlined"".Some examples:-Want to add music to your Iphone by simply dragging &amp; dropping your files?Can't do that!  You have to download the clunky Itunes program on your computer to transfer songs.-Want to download the photos and videos you took with your Iphone?  It doesn't always work! You might have to go through Icloud, IF it lets you!  If Icloud is full and you try to download through USB using Apple's recommended method it might not read the device (it didn't for me).  And if you open your Iphone's internal storage on the computer and download the files manually, it will continually try to cut you off in the middle of downloading!-Have a favorite pair of headphones that you want to use?Too bad!  You have to buy one with Apple's Lightning connector, or buy an extra adapter that you now have to carry around.-Can't transfer certain songs?  Apple says it's for user protection and copyrights, even if you own the music CD.  What they really mean is you need to buy the songs AGAIN from Apple/Itunes.-Want to download YOUR OWN PICTURES with a quick drag and drop?NOPE, can't let you do that!  I was instructed to go through Itunes to do it but it wouldn't recognize ANY of my standard Jpegs.  So I was given a 2nd option of going through Icloud, where you can only upload a measly, pathetic 5gb of pics and videos-Have more than 5gb of pics and videos (like everyone else does)?No problem.  You just have to PAY a monthly subscription for more storage!-Want to set your songs to shuffle while connected to bluetooth?Too bad! No shuffle option unless your speakers/car gives you the option!  What the hell is this?!-Want play your songs with a better music app like you could easily do for free with Android!Nope, not happening!  When you were forced to sync your songs through Itunes it linked them only to the default Apple music app and the third party music player won't be able to find any of your music.-Want to quickly and easily organize your files into folder and subfolders like you could on your computer and Android?Can't let you do that for free!  Owners of Apple computers which cost 2x the price of similarly spec'd computer can, otherwise you can only have limited options through Apple's apps.-Want better sound quality in your car than Bluetooth?Apple can't let you have that!  I was able to connect any Android phone via USB to my fairly new 2yr old car for better sound quality and a full song menu but with the Iphone it's ""invalid"".Basically, all of the limitations that I've run into are PURPOSELY programmed by Apple.  These issues don't exist on Android! You paid for the phone but they control not only what you can do, and how you can use your Iphone, but they also control your pictures, music, media, etc. in relation to their devices.",3
5.0,"Really enjoying the battery life!
  
","October 21, 2019",No,"So far I have the opportunity of enjoying my iPhone XR for five months and come change now and want to give my experience so far compared to my iPhone 8 Plus. Firstly if you are looking to upgrade off camera along this upgrade is worth it alone, other than that I could not tell any real major changes of the devices! iPhone XR does feel lighter to me, normal applications like YouTube, safari and Facebook opened up a tad be faster then the XR. Heavy day of usage would leave my phone around 10% around 5pm, normal day of usage of my phone would leave me around 30% easily and that’s just usage web browsers and applications no gaming or youtube.Screen- Was a smidge brighter then previous phones I have used. Also very responsive to touch did not witness any delays or lagging so far.Battery- It’s  the way better then my iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone XR battery life is stellar.Speaker- Comparing  to my iPhone 8 Plus I do not see much of a difference but the sound is clearer and has a more bass to me.- [x] Bottom line- It’s cheaper then the last year variant the iPhone 8 Plus which is great for me, equipped with amazing camera that’s a huge upgrade you ask me, battery life is still great too! I would recommend this to anyone anyone who is on a iPhone 8 or below honestly because the battery last way longer and the cameras are strong upgrade seriously.",1
1.0,"Horrid reception compared to phones 1/2 the price
  
","June 6, 2019",No,"The cell phone reception for IPhone Xr is far inferior to any other brand phone we have on the same cellular network. Phone does not drop the call, but you and your other party will have trouble holding a conversation due to voice drop outs.For a product to not be able to perform its primary function is inexcusable. Are you listening Apple?",4
4.0,"Seems to be the best choice of the three
  
","July 5, 2019",No,"Upgraded from a 5C as more memory and a larger screen were desired.  I also have a similarly sized S6 and the Apple screen is much easier to read.In the store, the other 2 models felt better in the hand, including balance. But the price.I purchased the 128GB model in blue and snapped on the clear case with no screen protector. It is a good combination and the screen still looks great after getting dropped and banged around for a month.  My cellular reception is better, can use the phone in places where the 5C had no signal. The battery life is awesome but I get nothing like 11 hours.  The 2 speakers are welcomed but it doesn't really sound like stereo, more like 2 mono sources.  Thru the included wired ear buds, it sounds tinny, honestly, the 5C thru a traditional headphone jack sounds better to me.  I like the GPS feature, saves some cellular minutes.  Screen capture doesn't always work, maybe they will fix that.I'm not ready for inductive charging, a battery case, nor wireless ear buds so won't speak to those features. Also not using Apple Pay but the face recognition is awesome, Awesome I say!With the sunroof open, it goes to sleep due to the heat, a minor annoyance. There is no edge-to-edge display on any Apple phone; if they claim so, they're lying. They do, and they are.",0
2.0,"Okay phone, poor value.
  
","August 16, 2019",No,"So I had purchased the iPhone XR Yellow; XR for hearing aid compatibility and yellow because because it was the lowest price of all the colors. Go figure!  The TLDR:  Ok phone that is not worth a $750 price tag.First, cosmetically, the phone is nice to look at. The build feels premium. Though, that is where the beauty stops. With such an ugly notch, thick housing and large bezels, the XR is aging prematurely when compared to other phones in the same price point. The LCD screen, though grand for an LCD, feels dated. Even the shear weight of this phone will feel much heavier than other phones with a similar screen size.The only major advantage of this phone is the battery life. I was able to get days of battery life after just a single charge. Unfortunately, the long battery life is somewhat trumped by the rediculously slow charge speed. If your XR has a low battery, be ready to plug it in overnight, because it will need a solid 8 hours to get back to a full charge. This felt like stepping back into the year 2013. This may be a good time to note that the charge cable and USB wall outlet adapter both feel cheap as though they were purchased from the dollar store.Video streaming lagged consistently when I tried to play YouTube or NetFlix. I'm not sure why, but I would commonly see a spinning circle on screen instead of the video I was trying to watch. This was quite annoying. The XR has the fastest chip set on the planet, yet it didn't perform as such.Apple still doesn't have Type-C on their 2018 models. This also makes the phone feel dated when so many other products have moved on to Type-C.",0
1.0,"Hate It Compared to the i8...
  
","December 18, 2019",No,"As a Company we have used the i6 and i8, and really benefited.  They were easy to use and served every need.We got the XR thinking we needed updated capability.  We HATE it.It forces you to divulge private information, demands a Credit Card for the App Store feature and many other invasive issues.It has gotten rid of the Home Button that was so easy to use.  Overall we really regret getting this phone.",0

","November 23, 2019",No,"I have the 11 pro now because what I didn’t find appealing about the XR is that it didn’t quite feel like Apple’s flagship phone. It’s not supposed to be. It’s supposed to be an affordable phone with Apple features and it is just that. But, I am happier with the 11 pro now.",1
