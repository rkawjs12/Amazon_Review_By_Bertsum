","December 13, 2019",No,"I just bought a nest thermostat and this came with it. I already have an alexa so I was curious to compare the two. First things first, I dont pay for the subscription stuff, and that does affect the use. My suggestion is spend a little more and buy alexa. The base use for Google appears to be solely for smart home immigration. If you want to be able to pick a specific song,artist, or genra google expects you to pay for it while the free catalog for Amazon is significantly more. Google has a more business like approach to the answers it gives while alexa is more in depth, and at times funny. I do like how google can cast the video from my security cameras to a Chromecast, something that Amazon doesn't, but that isnt as important to me.",15

","December 29, 2019",No,"After hours, upon hours, upon days of Amazon trying to get my Alexa to work with Harmony Hub, including updating to Gen 3 and still failing, and after Amazon blaming Harmony,  I purchased the Google Mini Home. Wala, my Harmony works fine with a single command to Google. Not the, hey Alexa, ask Harmony to turn on........  Just turn on...... and it works with Google Mini. Can’t say the same for Alexa.",1
5.0,"Pretty cool device that was a unexpected gift. Two thumbs up.
  
","December 25, 2019",No,I didn’t buy this from Amazon it came from Google directly but I can assure you this is a pretty cool device. It was a free gift from project/Google fi cell phone service. I didn’t exactly know what one was until I got it. it works for Spotify and Pandora and plays my music and sounds really good and is all a Google assistant that listens to my room. It works on both my iPhone 11 and my pixel 3A when I asked the assistant something it pops up on my iPhone screen and allows me to open the Web portion of anything I asked. Cool google assisting with the killer speaker for music.I’m happy enough that I’m going to buy a second one so they can have stereo sound in the room.,1

1.0,"DO NOT BUY - BLUETOOTH TERRIBLE
  
","January 10, 2020",No,I CANNOT RECOMMEND AVOIDING THIS PRODUCT AT ALL - The Bluetooth cuts out every 2-5 minutes requiring a reconnect every time. It’s the worst thing I’ve purchased in a very long time.,0
