5.0,"It's a winner!
  
","November 25, 2019",Yes,"Over and over, in the ""most helpful"" reviews, I read about ""ads"" displaying. This does NOT ever display ads, it displays Alexa skills and things to try with your device. I read that people cannot get that to stop happening. It's right in the settings: go to: ---Home &amp; Clock--- then: ---Home Content--- then, turn off ---Discovery---, that will end the Alexa skills displaying (may cycle once after setting but then they're gone for good). I kept reading that people who want to use it as a clock were upset that the clock kept getting minimized (to left corner) to show other things. That's because, yet again, they aren't setting it up correctly. So, in the settings: go to: ---Home &amp; Clock--- then: ---Home Content--- then, turn off ---Rotate Continuously---, that will make the Home screen always display a full screen clock. You can also just turn off any content in that list. Note that each time you go into the settings, immediately after, it WILL show you a single skill or any content you left on. But that's it. It will just be a clock from then on, until you interact with it again and then it may display a single skill or that content. Once. Then back to being a full time clock.Full disclosure: I got this to use as an alarm clock and not as a primary viewing assistant. For that, I recommend the larger echo devices. I also got this on Prime Day for $50 (rather than $90). That's a screaming good deal for what is basically a voice activated, smart alarm clock with a lot of different options.Decent Alarm clocks run $30-50 anyways so I thought I'd give this device a try for $50. I should have bought 2. Even for $90, I feel like this is a great device but if you wait, it will eventually go on sale again. I don't intend to use it to watch TV shows or movies, I have TVs, tablets and PCs for that. I saw people mentioning being disappointed in the resolution or screen quality. I don't see the problem. This certainly isn't going to compare to your $300-800 smart phone screen but it's not bad looking when playing videos or displaying the clock. It's similar to say, an iPhone 3 or Galaxy S2. I feel like the people complaining are expecting ""the moon"" for the money this costs. It's $90. Not $150 or $200.There was alot of fairly bad reviews on the echo 5, but I wanted something bigger that I could use to see my ring doorbell video.  Setup was easy and got it running no problem.  Tried ""alexa show me the front door""... and nothing worked!!  No panic, went and pushed the ring doorbell and checked my phone, live video seen no problem.  OK, try Echo again ""alexa show my the front door""  Bingo!!  video displayed in about 3 sec's (i'd seen comments it was taking over 11 seconds) but that's not what I experienced.Next sound quality, tried a few songs... Wow I was not expecting much in the audio quality, but it was actually really good and as a side benefit, it displays the words of the song as it's sang, pretty cool.  Basically all the other alexa functions work as with any device, but now you also get video feedback. Ask about the weather,  get your info, plus it displays the  temp, clouds, sun, whatever...  Very happy with purchase and highly recommended!!","1,556"

","November 26, 2019",Yes,"I really do enjoy this device and am impressed at the abilities of Alexa.

The screen is much better quality (and larger) than the Echo Show 5 and larger screen than the first generation Echo Show.  The design takes up less room than the earlier Echo Show models and looks better too.  If you buy a stand for it, get the one from EchoGear (shown in my photos).

I have 3 Ring cameras, front door bell, a front &amp; back yard motion light cameras. Once I followed the steps to add Ring in the Alexa app, like 2 minutes, It was so intuitive I don't know what I did right but another 5 minutes I said Alexa show front door and she said okay and there was my front door camera on the screen. Then I said Alexa, show back which is what I named the devise ""back"" and she said okay and showed the back yard camera, same with the front successfully. I have many more smart devices the Alexa app found on my wi-fi so I'm excited to figure out how to add them.Also, now I understand the importance of naming the devices. Alexa only understands exactly what you name them in the devise list for voice commands.",368

","November 26, 2019",Yes,"I have a bunch of Echo devices in my home. Including the Echo show  2 10 inch.I feel like this is the best bargain at current prices.Sure you are getting 20 percent smaller in terms of screen size. But the difference is not too crazy.The screen resolution is almost the same. It looks very good.The sound is very solid in the echo show 8.I think the 8 is a compressed version on the 10 inch version. But that doesn't mean it's not good.Overall, I would definitely consider getting this over the 10 inch model. The price difference justifies it.",287
5.0,"A Great Addition to Your Home Tech
  
","November 27, 2019",Yes,"This is my first Echo device.  Had already set up several skills on the Alexa app before the Echo Show 8 arrived, so I was ready for it; and had my expectations already set as to the quality of the response to the voice commands.  If you are considering entering the Echo 'echo-system' and are on the fence about getting one of these, try downloading the Alexa app to your phone or tablet and try it out.  On the phone app (iPhone and iPad in my case), a button push activates Alexa; with the Show 8, just say her name and she starts listening.Some of the Alexa skills still need some work, and your satisfaction with them may vary.  But for the Show 8, it's great!  The speakers sound better than  I expected (actually are pretty awesome compared to the Show's size) and will fill the room with sound.  The Show 8 has an external speaker jack on the back, but I don't see ever using it - the internal speakers are THAT good - can feel the bass from the speakers vibrating the kitchen countertop.  With the speakers in the rear, having it backed up close to a wall provides the best sound projection and quality.  A similar concept to some higher end Bose speakers, which have rear-firing elements that are designed to reflect the sound off of a wall and provide more ambience.When music is played, the lyrics scroll on the screen, so you can sing along (if your housemates and dog can stand it).  Even when playing at a higher volume level, I can still get Alexa's attention but it may take more than one attempt.  The microphones are quite sensitive and will pick me up from another room as long as there is not much background noise.  The Show 8 also has Bluetooth, so you can pair it with a phone, laptop or other device and play music through the Show 8's speakers.  I do this frequently since the Show 8's speakers sound much better than the internal phone or laptop speakers.  I did notice a bit of a delay in watching a video on the laptop, and then the audio coming out of the Show 8.  It just may be an artifact of using Bluetooth to send the audio.Rather than the recommended stand (or no stand), I purchased the ""Echo Show 8 Adjustable Aluminum Swivel Stand"" also sold on Amazon (you can see my review of the stand on that page).  A stand is recommended to allow you to position the Show 8 at an optimum viewing angle.I also purchased several of the Meross Wifi smart plugs (also sold on Amazon).  Have them programmed to link with Alexa so I can give one command (such as ""Alexa, turn on Christmas Lights"") and ALL the plugs in the Christmas group turn on at the same time.  Pretty cool!  Once Christmas is over, the plugs will be assigned other duties.The Show 8 can browse the web.  There is a Firefox skill that will allow you to open a web browser.  And if you don't like tapping letters on the screen, you can pair a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse (see photo).  If you have an HP printer, it can be linked to the Show 8 to print grocery lists or stuff you find on the internet.Not a deal-killer for me, but can't seem to be able to disable the ""Try Alexa &lt;blah blah blah&gt;"" on the bottom of the home screen.  You CAN disable the skills cycling with other topics in the center of the screen as another reviewer noted.  I have the Show 8 in my kitchen; so the display is not ""in my face"" and I am not looking at it all the time, so it is not THAT big of a deal.Have to admit I was skeptical and wasn't sure if I would find it useful....but I'm liking this device more every day.  Now an Echo Dot has found its place in our household as well.  Along with some Echo Buttons....Like the Echo Show 8 so much that I ordered another one to give to my daughter and son-in-law!",161

Anyway I thought it would be ok as you can see much when there is a brighter picture in it. But when it got inactive, I’ll have only a clock and a black screen full with backlight bleed. Will contact Amazon and see if it’s normal or if I can get a replacement.——Edit: Amazon it’s awesome, and it’s sending me a replacement.

","November 26, 2019",Yes,"Although I get frustrated with Alexa (a lot), this Echo Show 8 has been a treat so far compared to the Echo and the Echo Dot. And I haven’t even used it for cooking yet, which is why I got it.

Much better!Edited to add: if I interact with Alexa (i.e., ask for weather) afterwards I am getting a “Try Alexa” suggestion, so I can understand where if you’re doing a lot with the device, that could become an annoyance.The sound quality impressed both my husband and me for the most part. (Maybe we’re just not very discerning in that regard.)Anyway, I like it a lot. Oh, I almost forgot to mention that I really appreciate being able to turn off the camera, too.P.S.

4.0,"The Pros, Cons and Oks for the Echo Show 8 (HR).
  
","November 25, 2019",No,"Pros:__________• Very compact and simple design.  I like these designs because they can fit in all rooms. Bedroom, Kitchen, and the living room this echo can fit in any location.• It has a large rubber foot that keeps it from shaking around.• Big fan of the black mesh fabric that covers the back of the device. It doesn’t become a finger/dust print magnet.• Extremely simple setup as you do the setup right on the screen (you don’t need to download any app). All you need is Wi-Fi and you’re basically done.• You can set multiple alarms and have them repeat on various days of the week. Change the alarm tone, have the sound gradually increase to get you out of your sleep, and be able to play the music that you want. This a customized alarm system that fits anyone’s needs.• To add more customization, you can make this device a picture frame. You can set a single pic or a slideshow of pics as your background.• I love the privacy. To have a “physical” shutter, to block the camera, is an excellent choice. If I didn’t have this, I would, like every laptop, place some tape in order to block the viewing. It’s very quick to just slide on the shutter. In this day in age, you never know whose watching. It’s the little things, like these, that shows that Amazon knows what we want (sometimes).• There is a button (next to the volume controls) on the device that will allow you to mute the mic.• You can say to Alexa ""delete everything I said today"" to erase your recorded search history (The little things go a long way).• Even when I block the camera shutter, I can still take calls or talk to Alexa.• The light sensor goes into a nighttime display when the lights are off. Waking up at 3 to check the time was quick and painless to my eyes. The sensor is able to add the appropriate amount of light, depending on how much light is in the room. It’s similar to the auto-brightness we have on our smartphones.• Has a built-in 3.5 mm audio cable which means you can plug this in your home speaker system. I didn’t find the need to test this out because it’s just plugging into another speaker.• Two web browsing options, Firefox and Amazon Silk, but I recommend you stick with Firefox (Found it better in the use with this device).• Like all voice commands, asking Alexa for the weather, make a call, play music, turn on a light (a smart light), and so forth does its job, most of the time (will go into details in the Con section).• Software-wise, I do appreciate that on the screen, if you hit the smart home button, organizes what devices you use frequently. I found this very useful to see what smart devices I use the most (what a shocker that it was the smart lights in my house.) It is useful if you need to quickly turn a specific smart device off.• If you have a thermostat smart device, one cool feature is changing the temperature with the Show 8. I ask Alexa to change the temperature of my thermostat and a slider pops up on the screen, allowing me too automatically to tweak the temperature further.• There is also a button, on the device menu, to turn off everything connected to the Show.• The voice calls come through the Alexa app or through Skype.• Does have Bluetooth. As Sheldon Cooper wisely once said, “Everything is better with Bluetooth.”• The microphone picks up my voice very quickly. This is having the TV on average person volume level and, probably, 20 feet away.• The screen is actually viewable. Having seen the Echo 5 in the past, The Show 8 screen is a huge improvement in viewing videos or getting a glance for quick info (weather, news highlights, time, etc.).• With smart screen layout, I can see this fit for security cams and baby monitors. I have a Ring camera on my door, and this works like a charm if I need to see who at the door.• Saying “Alexa, start my day.” Is a pretty cool experience if you spend the time customizing what you want to see and hear, from Alexa, when getting out of bed, You can have a very modern morning cycle.• Taking and receiving phone calls is a real breeze. I here no static or break in communication when talking to my colleague. Note that I didn’t try WIFI calling international.• To summarize, you have 4 ways of communication: Message, Call, Drop-In, and Announce.• When playing Foo Fighters, the Show 8 does display the lyric alongside the song it’s playing, “The Pretenders.” One word for this, Karaoke!• Good speakers for music coming in the Show 5. It’s loud, which was a little surprising, given the size. Not enough for a house party, but enough for study or cooking time.Cons and Oks:__________• You can’t watch YouTube videos by using Alexa’s voice command. You have to physically go and type it in the web browser. Google owns YouTube and as of 2019, Amazon and Google are not the best in merging software. A major buzzkill because learning how to do something is what YouTube is made for.• Instead of YouTube, Alexa will bring you to Wiki videos. They’re very basic, not a significant amount in video inventory, and I was only able to access the intro videos. I wanted to know how to bake cookies and I needed to go to the screen and touch the next video for it to play. Wiki videos don’t give you the opportunity to cook “Binging with Babish” videos.• Beware of the advertisement for watching movies and shows. Amazon loves cutting 30% of the screen with advertisements. You need to be prepared for this experience because this is not going away.• Unlike Google’s Nest Hub, when you speak to Alexa, the device will not show you what you said. Alexa has messed up in what I said, yet I don’t know which word that caused the miscommunication.• I want to mention this again, NO SUPPORT FOR ANY GOOGLE SERVICES. To be honest, Google owns the internet (Photos, Drives, Nest Cameras, YouTube, etc.) and with this device, all the basic searches/videos you want require additional steps.• Want mapping directions to go to a place around your city? Stick to google maps on your smartphone because Alexa doesn’t do this.• The camera isn’t anything to brag about. It doesn’t have any advance HDR features, but then again it’s only for video calls.• Web typing on this is miserable. I just stick to my phone if I need to search for something really quick.• The bezel around the screen makes everything look smaller than it is. Its screen size does help reduce the feeling.• No real apps are useful, given the size.• Alexa is no Google Assistant. You have to speak in a specific syntax in order for Alexa to do what you want it to do. With simple demands, Alexa works like a charm. It’s when you start asking random questions that Alexa will say “Sorry, I’m not sure about that,” or something similar. Example: I said ""Alexa, show me dog videos"" and nothing happens but saying “Alexa, open Prime Video,” it opens right away. Very specific on what you need to say.• No USB port to charge your phone. This Show, to me, is more for public viewing, the center of attention. A USB port would’ve been great not only to charge your phone, but to input pictures, videos, and even recipes into the Show.• When you start getting used to the Show 8, turn off Alexa tips. Having that feature on will clutter the screen by default. You have a small screen and yet the Show 8 wants to put as much as it can on it.• When streaming music from my iPhone to the Show 8 (using Bluetooth) the music isn’t clear as it’s plagued with Bluetooth artifacts. I have to assume this is a software issue, so it may be resolved in the near future updates. Still, I think you should know.• There is some lag on the touch screen. Tapping on a back button I have to wait 2-3 seconds before it follows with my request.• Want to move it around, you need to pay for the viewing angle attachment because you can’t adjust viewing angles without it.• The screen maybe a little too bright when it’s dark in the room.• The Show 8 doesn’t have any Dolby features, which makes the volume for music loud, but not clear. Playing acoustic songs are fine but playing anything other complex songs (Foo Fighters, Lady Gaga) distorts the quality of the song.• There are a lot of steps to just do a simple task. I wanted to pick my preferred source images and had to go through Settings, Home &amp; Clock, Clock, and finally to Personal Photos. A lot of steps for such a simple task.Bottom Line:__________Of the Echo Show and Echo Show 5, this is the best one out on the market. The two things that make this the best between the three is the screen and the privacy layout. The screen is large enough that watching videos wasn’t a hazel, and the manual buttons for privacy are a must in this day in age. It’s a very nice design and I see this as something you will have in the kitchen of all places.The Show 8 does a lot of decent work, but it also has numerous other features that it isn’t the best at due to software issues. The resolution isn’t mind-blowing, as it’s something to either play music, or even a movie, in the background while you work. This is no replacement for a screen to watch for 2 hours as it’s more for a quick 5 minutes here and there. This is why I see this for the kitchen as it’s a great place to follow cooking videos. Anywhere else I feel it would not be put into use enough to be worth the cost.Also, I advise everyone to take a look at the Google Nest Hub, Lenovo and the rest of the Echo Show smart system. The truth is, for a universal home smart system, this isn’t it. The Google Nest’s software is top of the line in communication and user interface. The Show 8’s main highlights are privacy, video calls, smart house function, and the price. With the price you’re getting it’s a nice system to screen ratio, but if you’re not fully on board in the Amazon world you’ll be restricted in so many ways that sometimes it’ll be quicker to just take out your smartphone.Overall: The best of the three Echo’s, but most useful in the kitchen or at your desk.",86

I’m unable to select most of my Facebook albums, and the weather forecast does not stay - rather it rotates on and off.Overall this device accomplished nothing notable, I would not recommendEdit: an amazon employee named Kristina reached out about some of my concerns which I do appreciate and took some of my feedback. She confirmed that there is no way to turn off the things to try prompt but told me that it was a common feedback. While there is no published limit in the number of Facebook albums that it supports I found that after about 50 it stops looking which meant I had a lot of old albums to select from but nothing recent. The weather app can be selected as the only card but it doesn’t stay up, it appears for 30 seconds or so then Disappears for 30s and the cycle continues. Overall the physical quality of this device is quite good but the software lacks any sort of customization to the point that you pretty much get a stock experience out of the box.

1.0,"Great device except for one fatal flaw
  
","December 2, 2019",Yes,"This is a terrific device except for one flaw that ruins it:  A message displays at the bottom of the screen ""Try Alexa ....."" giving instructions on different ways to use the device.  For example, this message is displaying on my Show right this moment:  ""Try Alexa, show movies with Emma Watson"".There is NO WAY to turn off the constant display of these messages.  When Googling about this, I see hundreds of customers have already complained to Amazon about this problem. But Amazon refuses to give customers a way to remove this instrusive screen display.  Apparently Amazon thinks its customers are all 10-years old and need a constant on-screen display of instructions.This ""Try Alex ...."" is also a form of advertising, albeit advertising of Amazon's products.Until Amazon removes this display (or gives customers the choice of removing it), I strongly suggest buying a different company's product.  Google sells similar products.  So does Apple.  Neither company treats its customers with such contempt.UPDATE:  After submitting this review, I found a solution.  I wrapped a piece of black electrical tape around the bottom of the screen, positioned to hide the ""Alexa try ..."" messages, but not hide anything else.  The result looks great.  Those annoying messages no longer ruin the photos (or anything else) on my screen.  The only downside to this solution is it makes the screen slightly smaller.  But it's better to have a smaller screen that looks decent than to have a larger screen completely ruined by those messages.  I still recommend buying a different company's product.  It is ridiculous that the only way to block those messages is to cover the screen with electrical tape.",54

1.0,"Echo Show is barely usable today, but does have potential.  Software not ready for ""Prime Time"" yet.
  
","November 30, 2019",Yes,"The Echo Show is barely usable, yet has great potential.I say this because I wanted a nice Clock/iHeartRadio/Calendar/Weather Forecast/Voice Control for home automation device for my desk.  The Echo Show fails to provide these services...seamlessly.  Each of my requirements can be individually met, but not together.  Let me explain: If you are listening to iHeartRadio, then you cannot see the clock/weather/etc...  The BASIC function of what time it is does not work if you are listening to a radio stream.  The iHeartRadio app takes total control of your display, NO ROTATION of other apps.  There goes the clock.  Further, the font for the clock is not configurable.  Epic Fail for those with less than perfect vision.  The ability to customize this product to my desires/needs is why I rate this product as being barely able to be sold as an automation product.  To add insult, Amazon runs hints across the bottom of the screen: Try ""Alexa, open ....""  This is nothing but annoying SPAM!  You cannot disable this ""feature"".  I own most of the Echo product line and threw out the Google products because even with all of Echo's short comings it's still better than Google.  If you think that the Harmony product line integration with Echo is good, you are wrong.  Again, barely crosses the line of usability.  Example, you cannot set up a voice command to execute a single IR button (ie. arrow up, arrow down, etc..).  I have installed high end automation equipment in my house (Crestron) and compare this product with decent home automation.

The speed at which the pictures rotate is much to fast, at least for me, maybe more options would be nice like an hour or 2-3-4 or even as long as a day, have a different picture every morning.  The size is nice but without being able to enlarge the fonts .. well .. would be nice for people that can't see real well. Overall I like it but needs some fine tuning as far as options especially for the price.  Another thing is I really don't need Alexa telling me to try and do things all day long I mean come on, how about an opt out button.Update;  12/12/2019I had two brand new Echo Show 5's that got sent back for fixing after dealing/chatting with Amazon customer service several times over a two week period because picture rotation would freeze along with a couple other glitches that occurred now and then and got sent back two refurbished/renewed Show 5's, my point here is that my brand new Echo Show 8 is doing the exact same thing, so instead of going through the whole customer service fiasco again I'm just returning it while I still can and not getting another one.  Another thing I noticed that I disliked after using it for a few days was when you set a timer the numbers are nice and big with a count down, but after just a couple seconds the timer shrinks down to where you'd have to be inches away to read it.Maybe, just maybe when gen-2 Echo 8 comes out I may revisit it, but they need to make some major changes.",44

3.0,"Video functionality doesn't measure up
  
","November 30, 2019",Yes,"Context: I'm very ""Alexified."" Two full-size Echos, a Dot, a 4K Firestick, and now a Show 8. Various household smart devices including lighting, smart plugs, and a thermostat. So, I'm technically knowledgeable and happy in the Alexa/Amazon universe. A friend has a Show 5, and I wanted a new device in my kitchen, to replace the Dot, which was connected to (i.e., plugged into) a better speaker. Along came the Show 8 (the friend told me he was going to replace his 5 with the 8). Reviews indicated that the sound was good (it is; at least as good as my previous wired speaker). I was concerned about the negative reviews about the clock and the ""Try . . "" notifications, but some reviews said you could change the options in Settings (and in case you want to know up front, those reviews are incorrect; you can't). So here goes with the rest of my review:Pro's:--Easy to set up, especially if you already have other Alexa devices.--Good sound for such a small device.--Functions just as well as my other Echo devices. Except -- this is a *video* device, and that's where it falls short.--Price and Delivery: I got this on the Black Friday sale (actually on Thanksgiving Day itself) for $50 off. Delivery was projected for Monday, but it was delivered in two days. Can't complain about any of that -- but, given the Con's I'm about to list, I wouldn't pay full price for it.Con's:--The clock. You can't alter the font or format. You can't opt for a full-screen clock. I realize for some people this is not an issue, but I'm nearsighted and wear glasses with progressive lenses. At the bottom and middle of my lenses (reading- and mid-distance) the clock numerals are out-of-focus from across the room. I wish you could set up a home screen with a large-numeral clock, but you can't.--Kitchen use, i.e., for me, mainly the timer. The countdown numerals appear when you start the timer, but then disappear as the screen rotates through its content. It would be nice to just look at the screen and see how much time is left, but you have to ask Alexa the question (just as I had to do with my Dot).--The ""Try this and that ..."" text across the bottom of the screen. You can't get rid of it. Yes, I read one review (which, at the moment Amazon is featuring as its ""Most Helpful""). This review says you can go into various sub-menus of Settings, and make it go away. I tried those suggestions. They don't work.So, I'd say, be warned, especially when the Show 8 goes back to full price. The Show 8 needs a software update that allows changes to the clock, the ""Try this..."" messages, and other functions.  It saves space on my kitchen counter, compared to my former Dot-plus-external speaker, but its potential advantages as a video device are either not realized or else compromised.",20

","December 7, 2019",Yes,"So I got the Echo Show 5 early Nov 2019 as the Echo Show 8 wasn't going to be released until the end of the month and I needed a new Bedside alarm clock.  While I did like it, I felt it was too small for my needs.  The Echo 8 finally got released and so I sent this one back and ordered the Echo 8.  It was easy enough to do a Return and order this in its place.  So Amazon is great there.So I've included some pictures while I had both the 5 and 8 at the same time.  You can see the 8 on the left and the 5 on the right.  Front view and side view along with it in the dark.  I also included a short Video where you can see them side by side with the light on in the room and then what happens when I turn the light off.I do like the 8"" Echo Show better.  The biggest issue I have is the size of the TIME.  Look at this side by side.  They are the SAME SIZE!!!  Look at all that wasted screen space.  I got the 8 so I'd have a larger clock.  But in a bright room, look at the SMALL time in the top left corner.  Look at the picture in the dark. The clocks are the same size, but the 5"" one is in the middle of the screen, and the 8"" once is up on the top left.  Looks at that black screen and a huge amount of wasted space!!!!  Why is this?  It's almost made getting the 8"" screen pointless.The other thing is the line on the bottom where it shows you things you can ask Alexa.  There seems to be no way to turn it off.  I've turned pretty much everything OFF and yet it's still there.  If you were using this 8"" as a picture frame, which you can do and have it cycle through pictures, great, then maybe a small clock on the screen is a good thing?  But with an all-black screen, what is the point then?I like that you can easily block the camera on both the 5 and 8 as you can see in the picture the camera is blocked and I have ZERo plans to ever use those.  Both can hear me just fine.  I can tell it when to set an alarm and it does it easy enough.  In the morning I can just say ""Alexa Snooze"" and it'll snooze for 10 minutes.  It hears me just fine.  It can play my Apple Music.  I do have a couple of Apple Homepods that sound better.  I could use them as an alarm, etc.  But I wanted a screen I could just peek at.  Apple has no other options.  I'm not using my iPad as an Alarm clock.Amazon needs to update this 8"" version to better work with this larger screen. Or at least have an option to have a larger clock on the screen.  Also at first when its night mode, the screen had this black background glow I didn't like where the 5"" version didn't.  Luckily I was able to adjust the brightness down just a bit which cured that issue.  Now I have a completely black screen except for the time.  The time is also not very bright.  It's not lighting up my room which is a good thing.",13

2.0,"Not Good, but the ""Suggestions "" Are a Non-issue
  
","November 30, 2019",Yes,"First impression - not impressed. There is much, much room for improvements with this device. I'll say that the ""suggestions"" at the bottom of the screen are a non-issue for us, I can't imagine why this bothers some people as much as it does. Frankly, I never notice them on my Fire TVs or this Echo. Pros are good sound, and everything as far as smart home device control goes. Having had an Echo in the house since the beta edition, we have added many bulbs and a thermostat that the Echo Show works well with. The cons are too many and too important. a) It has Hulu, but no Netflix. It is the only device I know of that can't get Netflix. The only video options it has are NBC (wow), Hulu, Food Channel if you pay for the service, Tubi and Prime video.  One out of 5 is not bad, would love to have more options there. b) The inability to add any apps. If I could put SlingTV on this, I wouldn't care about the Netflix. Adding Plex would give me access to my own server of content. c) YouTube looks awful. You can ask Alexa to do a YouTube search and you get all these tiny thumbnails in one column that runs down the left side while the majority of the screen is left unused, just white wasted space. I've tried both browsers and they both look like this. The YouTube app would help here. d) Fingerprints on the screen are VERY noticeable and take away from the picture quality. I believe that after any initial setting up I won't be touching it too much anyway. e) When I'm using the screen for viewing something and I tell Alexa to turn off a light, it goes to a very useless/annoying screen showing a light bulb with a slider next to it... and it stays there 15 seconds or so. Meanwhile, I'm missing my other thing I was watching. Why would it do this? I've obviously just displayed the fact that I can control the light with my voice, why would I now need a second option for the light adjustments for my finger?? This alone is a deal breaker!! f) So far, I have not been able access all of the content that I get on my Kindle. I push many recipes and other Docs to my Kindle and can see that content on any device that runs the Kindle app....until now. I can see my books, but not my Docs/Collections. Did not see that coming. Now for recipes I'm seeing that I need to sign up with AllRecipes.com and send recipes there to easily access them with the Echo Show.It seems to me, to get the most out of this, I need to conform to Amazon's way and not mine. Get an allrecpies account, sign up with Hulu. Or if I buy a Ring doorbell I can see a camera view. On my FireTV and Kindle tablets I am able to access all of my security cameras with the installation of a single app. I just received the Show yesterday and I will look to see if I can make this thing more useful for my needs, I honestly haven't spent that much time with it. Maybe I can find some answers to my concerns. In the past, while I'm in the kitchen, I have just stood my Kindle Fire 8 tablet on the counter, I'll probably go back to doing that. The tablet has more functionality, all the apps, all my Kindle content and and it's portable. I'm going to update this review in a couple of days. By then, I will have decided if the Show has to go.UPDATE: This thing is going back. I've tried what I would think should be simple tasks, it fails. I tried to setup an album in Prime photos for changing backgrounds. It's been on the same photo for several hours although the album has 209 photos in it. I say Play a Slideshow of that album or any album. It shows 4 or 5 pics and goes back to the home screen. Also, it appears there's no way to shuffle the albums - why not? Fire TVs allow the slideshows to shuffle. I tried to see my security cams using the Monocle skill. I can now call them up with Alexa on my Fire TVs, but not the Show. I looked further into the Allrecipes skill - it's the worst. As someone said it's better to have Alexa find recipes on the web.I have many Alexa enabled devices, but this by the far the most useless. Most of the positive reviews seem to be impressed with the things that need no screen - play music, control devices and lights. The screen has little to no functional use. Perhaps if this had been my first Alexa I would be more impressed. The show will have to go.",8

As it turns out, that was incorrect information as has now been confirmed by Amazon customer support, as well as my own personal experience. I hope Amazon will listen to their customers and offer an option to disable this device behavior. Similar to an unsubscribe or opt-out of email setting, Amazon could offer a frequency option  (turn off, once a month, weekly, daily, hourly, on continuously). This one behavior truly ruins an otherwise good experience. If this is corrected, this device would earn 4-5 stars no question.Pros: Good sound, bright display, nice form factor, looks nice on the kitchen counter where I have it placed. Nice to have lyrics display while music is playing, local content is appreciated, good microphones, and I like the ability to see my cameras in the screen and the ability to view my home automation control (browser), physical camera shutter for privacy.Cons: Inability to turn off ""Things to Try"" is annoying, the optional stand should be less expensive, it could use more user options for what is displayed and how, and with Amazon having their own Silk browser, we should be able to at a minimum use voice to launch the browser with a saved bookmark. (e.g. ""Alexa, open bookmark My Favorite Website in Silk""  or better yet a routine that can open websites, so we could use natural language of our choosing, ""Alexa, show me XYZ."" .  Eventually, it would be nice to have natural language voice and/or gesture controlled browsing. Personal preference, I wish the closed shutter was more subtle (e.g. dark red or gray dot VS white on the black Echo show)",8

","December 3, 2019",Yes,"Amazon had produced some great Echo show devices but they still haven't grasped the idea of how to make this the optimal user experience.My first Echo Show was the original 5"" model introduced in 2017.  I was one of the first to purchase this and three years later, it still performs admirably.Since then, Amazon has introduced a massive 10"" model, a smaller 5"" model and now this 8"" model.I have bought all of them.My absolute favorite is the 10"" model.  If you have RING cameras in your home or you want to use this as a photo frame that will continuously show your photos linked to your Amazon Photo account, this is the only model you should be considering.  Yes, it costs more, but the extra real-estate makes a big difference.I bought the 5"" model to use as a bedside clock.  However, it was too small.  I went with this 8"" model to use as a bedside clock, though despite user recommendations on how to make it work, it doesn't operate as a full-sized clock.  The digits are minimalized to one of the corners of the screen.I am now looking at the Lenovo clock as that 5"" made specifically as a bedside smart clock display.But getting back to the 8"" Echo Show...It's a terrific unit with a beautiful screen and it absolutely is a compromise between the smaller and larger models.The problem is, it still operates the same as it did back in 2017.  There doesn't seem to be any software revisions that make the Echo Show a better user experience.For instance, no matter what you turn off, the display is always showing a rotating list of things to try.  It may be helpful at first, but it's annoying after a while.Want a news feed displayed to your screen?  You really can't personalize the kind of news that you want.  In essence, this is the heart of the problem concerning the Amazon Echo Show experience.  You can't personalize this device to display the kind of content YOU want.  All the content is generalized.  You can't make this device show you any more personalized content than your next-door neighbor can.  It conveys generic news content at its best.You would think that after all these years, Amazon would have learned to make this a device that really works for you.  While you can go into the app and make traffic reports more personalized according to your work address, you really can't do anything more tailored to your needs.  Want specific news feeds or even your personal stock results updated on the screen?  You are completely out of luck.I have the Google Nest hubs as well.  I do like the Amazon ecosystem better, though there are some things that Google does better.  You can carry on a conversation with the Google Hubs.  You can't with Amazon.  You can use the hub with Nest cameras doorbells.  I can't do that with Amazon.  On the other hand, you can't view Ring cameras or doorbells on Google.  This fierce competition only serves to hurt the end-user who is forced to buy into both platforms to use all these devices.Where Amazon Echo and all its related devices clearly win is with the number of plug-ins available for it.  There are many really cool skills that you can add through the app to make Echo even more amazing.I really like the 8"" but overly disappointed that it's not designed as a bedside clock no matter what settings have already been suggested to use.  If I were new to these Echo devices and deciding upon the very first one I would want to purchase, I would go for the 10"" model -- especially if using cameras or showing off photos.",7
3.0,"Software downgrade from Show 5
  
","December 6, 2019",Yes,"We had a Show 5 in the kitchen and purchased the Show 8 primarily for the larger screen. While we are happy with the screen size we are decidedly not happy with the software implementation. It is in some ways a downgrade from the Show 5. Many reviewers have stated the same issues we have. First, unless we are fairly close to the Show 8 we cannot see the clock in the upper left hand corner. Unlike the the Show 5, there are no templates with a simple monochrome background and a large font clock in the center.  Second, there is no displayed date. Third, there is no way to turn off the ""Try Alexa""  displayed  at the bottom of the screen. If these issues were addressed in an update we would raise our review to five stars.",9

We have a fairly comprehensive Alexa network of devices and this is my major pain point.  It’s ridiculous.  I debated rating it higher, but i don’t think amazon will get the message unless customers speak loud enough.",9
1.0,"Yes this is incredibly annoying
  
","December 12, 2019",Yes,"So I read the comments before I purchased it stating that the ""Try, Alexa ...."" messages can't be removed from the screen.  Honestly I thought that was wrong.  But nope you really can't remove these messages.  They are on the bottom of every screen.  It is unbelievably annoying.  You think you should get use to it but you don't.There are complaints all over the web about this yet Amazon has done nothing.  Amazon if you read these messages let me give you a tip.  These messages don't make me more likely to use services they make me less likely.  I don't read the messages, I try to ignore them.Since Amazon is disregarding the input from users, the only option is to not buy the device and return the ones bought for a refund until Amazon adds the ability to turn these messages off.  Nobody buys a screen to be forced to watch ads.  Amazon if these messages truly added value then customers will leave them enabled on their screen.  The fact that you don't provide an option to turn them off indicates you realize they don't add value.I'm returning mine I suggest everyone simply think twice before you purchase one.  It truly is frustrating beyond belief that there is no way to disable these messages from the home screen.",7

","December 9, 2019",Yes,"Show 8 is a downgraded version of show 5 with a bigger screen. The display is not customizable like show 5. Looks like  Amazon product development team was rushed to launch something to beat google hub, but terribly failed.  The fonts are so big and unappealing.

The Show 8 is not like the Show 5. It WILL NOT display a large clock with the date AT ALL. What were you thinking Amazon? It's bad enough you're not responding to user complaints with the try whatever garbage in every screen. Now you took away the clock? EPIC FAIL!! I would NOT recommend the Show 8 to anyone. Time to start looking at what the competition offers. Better get on the software updates quick Amazon or you'll find people will go elsewhere for a more user friendly alternative.",8

","November 27, 2019",Yes,"Great device. I am glad I waited for the 8 inch. Definitely worth it. If you can still get it for under $100, get one before prices go back up.  I like being able to see my Ring cam, listen to radio stations, Alexa even plays games.. so far my favorite is guessing the song..I tried 90s, 2000s, and 2010s. You can play with another so as well.  It’s like having a tablet without running on battery and a great loud speaker already attached. Only thing she can’t do is make me a ham sandwich lol.",7
1.0,"Incredibly disappointed with Alexa and Fire TV integration
  
","December 6, 2019",Yes,"EDIT: Just when you think it can't get worse... It does. I was cooking dinner tonight and had a timer set. Once the timer was up, I said, 'Alexa, stop' and then tried about 15 other different variations of this. Alexa thought I had no timers set on any devices and the timer continued to sound until I had to unplug the device and plug it back in.Also, yesterday while watching TV, I randomly started to experience some incredibly noticeable sound distortion on my Fire TV stick 4k. Once again, after trying every other possible solution, I had to restart the device....ORIGINAL REVIEW:Incredibly disappointed. This was one of EIGHT Fire TV and/or Echo devices that I purchased on Black Friday, hoping to switch from Roku TV and have a seamless smarthome experience. Oh boy, was I wrong.Whether I rename the the Fire TV devices or use their original names, the echo devices CANNOT control or recognize the tv devices, even after properly pairing them under the TV &amp; Video setting in the Alexa app. I've tried to unpair, repair, restart, unregister, reregister, you name it. I've wasted days.  Generally, Alexa responds with 'I cannot find a device named ...' I consider myself very technically savy and I'm positive this is not something that I'm doing wrong. I should've read more into this before buying. TONS of people all over the internet are having this problem. It's infuriating. Plain and simple, until problems like this are fixed, Amazon is blaintantly false advertising the way that their devices work.Other cons to note:-Multiple video apps stutter and sometimes even randomly pause without ever resuming unless you physically resume them.-Alexa drastically lowers the volume of the TV when you are voicing a command. This in-and-of-itself is not a huge problem. However, it becomes a problem often when after the command is complete, Alexa does not resume the original volume of the content. When this has happened, I've had to ask Alexa to turn the volume back up to the specific number it was at.-I have two third generation echos paired as a stereo system for the TV. Often, even though I have my fire TV set as the preferred device, only the echos hear my voice, and once again, because they cannot control the TV, they say that they cannot recognize the device and then I just have to pick up the controller anyway.-The Fire TV will often think that it hears an 'Alexa' when absolutely no where near that word has been stated. Because the volume lowers drastically when Alexa is listening, it creates an obnoxious volume dip in content to listen for nothing when this happens.-You cannot set a sleep timerHonestly I could go on and on about the cons and about just how unhappy I am about these products. There are even more problems than what I listed here, but I'm not wasting too much breath, as after doing days and days of research on these topics, I've seen that Amazon has absolutely no answers to these problems, even after thousands of people have reported the same problems over and over. Unless there is some revalatory software updated coming, I'll be returning hundreds of dollars of equipment.",5

3.0,"Needs improvement
  
","December 2, 2019",Yes,"Having used an echo 5 for about 6 months, I was waiting for Black Friday pricing so I could ""upgrade"" to an echo 8, and replace my clock radio and dot on the night stand with the echo 5, and use the echo 8 in the living room with the larger screen.  Thinking the two devices would share a common software/user interface, I only glanced at a few of the reviews, and mentally wrote the negative ones off as likely operator error.  That proves to be a mistake.On the positive side, the screen is nice, the sound is better than the echo 5, and build quality appears good.On the negative side, the echo 5's interface and feature set is more desirable to me. I dislike that unless I upload a picture, the backgrounds on the echo 8 will rotate through a set of them. I want one background, and for it to stay that way. I also don't like the tiny clock in the upper corner. I was expecting at least an option to have a large clock in the center like the echo 5 has (old eyes). And I agree the rotating 'try this"" on the bottom of the screen is extremely annoying, and should at least be an option to turn off.It does interact with my smart home devices as the echo 5 did, so it will at least function for the primary purpose it serves for me. While I would give the echo 5 a 4 star review, I give the echo 8 a 3 star rating because it's just ""meh"", when I really should be gushing about how it's like the echo 5 on steroids, and not a poorly implemented, sort of, almost, copy of it with a bigger screen.TLDR: the other reviews are real,  it's not just a bigger screened echo 5.",5

I am holding off for now since I do have confidence in Amazon. They can't ignore all of the negative feedback regarding the ""try this"" and clock issues, can they?Come on Amazon!

","November 29, 2019",Yes,"Pros: The sound is great on this device and was easy to set up and sync with my other smart devices.Cons: The main one, and I almost sent it back due to it, is that it is difficult to get your own recipes on this. The main reason I purchased this echo was to have an easy way to pull up my recipes while cooking. The description says you can use the All Recipes skill, however they made it so you can’t sync to your All Recipes account. This makes it a pretty useless skill. I did find that there is a Sous Chef Recipe skill that is fairly basic looking, but easy to use.",6

","December 7, 2019",Yes,"A long awaited flop. I bought this to perform one task, that of ""show and tell"" .  As advertised this unit is supposed to be able to identify pantry items by holding them up and asking Alexa ""what am I holding ?"" Well it doesn't. I spent over 45 minutes talking to India and their techs who were very polite yet could not figure it out. My wife is legally blind and was so looking forward to this, as I had been hyping this feature for weeks. The second tech did however offer me a 15% discount on the Echo Show 10 which he assured me the feature would work. I can't send this back fast enough. Besides the fact that this seems like a tabletop billboard for Amazon with a banner of suggestions non stopping across the bottom of the screen. My worst purchase ever on Amazon, with the Fire tablet 10 that I also bought on Black Friday being a close second. Both items are going back.",5

","December 1, 2019",Yes,"Have to say I had higher expectations.  Will break down my review in a few parts noting that I have technically not received the product yet, however I did see the stand and played around with it at the Amazon store.  Here are a few things that bug me:1) Amazon's website says the item is out of stock and will take 2 weeks to deliver.  That's fine, until I drive 5 minutes to an Amazon store where they have piles of boxes of the Echo show 8 in both colors.  Why would Amazon's online store be out of stock when they have so many in stock so close by??2) The stand is REALLY not worth 20+ dollars.  I purchased as part of the bundle and still feel ripped off.  It doesn't swivel left and right, only goes up and down in a very uncomfortable way.  Honestly, the fact that it's a $20 piece of plastic that you absolutely need for this device to be visible is insane and Amazon is better than this.I will add more notes when I get a chance to review the functionality in more depth, on the surface it seems OK.  Same capabilities as all other Alexa devices + a screen to see stuff on.  Speakers are acceptable, screen quality is also acceptable.",4
2.0,"The screen makes it dumber....
  
","December 1, 2019",Yes,"Constantly hangs on simple tasks. The 25 dollar 2nd gen dot works tons better. Sure, there’s a big screen. The try it stuff on the bottom isn’t that bothersome to me. It’s the fact that I tell it to turn on a light, and the blue band stays across the bottom of the screen like it’s waiting for me to say something else, then the band disappears, I get no response, like “ok”, and I get no lights on.I been using the dots for awhile, everything is set up, and works on the other dots. It’s like this device suffers from a case of the “stupids”. I think the screen is a niche thing that nobody really needs in an age of cell phones, and it makes the device worse by having it. I’m thinking the Show uses different firmware than the dot, and the show firmware is poorly done, which is actually a conservative review.Purchase at your own risk. Odds are you don’t need it if you have a smart phone with the Alexa app on it. If you insist, I’d wait it out a bit til the developers get their crap together on the software side of this. If you just want to control a plug or light, pick up a 2nd gen dot on the cheap.",4
4.0,"Almost perfect, but needs a couple of small tweaks
  
","November 29, 2019",Yes,"I really like this unit, and like one of the previous reviewer‘s has mentioned you can definitely do away with most of the Alexa suggestions by diving into the settings.There is one thing I wish they would do differently. On the echo five, there is a set of very attractive clock faces that can be chosen, but on this unit you can only choose a category such as art, travel etc. The echo will then choose random clock faces from that category to display. I would very much prefer having the ability to choose a clock face and stay on that one as opposed to having the unit choose various faces for me. For example on the echo show five there is an attractive nature scene with a lot of greenery and I would love to be able to put that same picture on the echo eight, but it’s unavailable.Additionally, we need a full screen clock option. Having a huge screen and relegating the clock to a small corner is not going to work for many of us.Other than these missing options it’s a winner, and I hope they will change the software soon to be able to allow for better clock face and display choices",4

","December 20, 2019",Yes,"If, like me, you thought the Echo Show 5 was fine (minus one glaring issue I'll get into later) but simply wanted a larger display to be able to see the time and temp across the room easier and thought that the Echo Show 8 would be exactly that... save your money.For some unknown reason the developers at Amazon decided that the clock &amp; temp display on the Echo Show 8 should only be able to take up a very small portion of the upper left-hand corner of the display.  This means that if you bought the Echo Show 8 to be able to see the clock easier due to it being larger you will actually get a smaller clock display.WuT?!Exactly.  Who at Amazon thought it would be a good idea to add code to limit the max size of the clock and temp on a device that costs more than the smaller version?  My eyes aren't even that bad but I can see how others with worse vision or possibly older people might prefer the larger display to be able to see the clock &amp; temp better.  Bamboozled!In addition, the constant need to ""advertise"" to paying customers that's present on the Echo Show 5 also carries over on the more expensive Echo Show 8, sadly.  No matter what you do you can't fully disable everything that rotates on the home screen.  This means that you can't disable all of that garbage and just have the home screen be a clock and the temperature 24/7/365.  Even if you disable every option as well as the ""Rotate Continuously"" at the bottom you will still have your precious clock &amp; temp minimize on a regular and constant basis while the stupid thing gives you ""pro tips"" of crap you can try saying.Amazon, how 'bout you give the users the option to FULLY and COMPLETELY disable this?!Enough people have complained about this and yet you persist on treating us like children.  Children with money to spend, mind you, but children nonetheless.  I don't need the hand holding that you seem to think we need.  I'm not huddled in a dark corner of my room shaking nervously frightened because I don't know how to ask Alexa to turn on a light.  You want to give new users a tutorial when they first set it up?  Fine.  This constant nagging that can't be disabled though is way, way, WAY too much.Enough people have hammered the reviews over exactly this on both devices and yet the solution has been ""coming soon"" for months.  This isn't a difficult change to implement if you really wanted to.I'm returning this Echo Show 8 due to these two reasons.  Awesome device (probably) if you can look past these issues I'm guessing.  I've already invested too much on three Echo Show 5's that I can't return so I'm not investing even more in an Echo Show 8 since it does the same BS only worse as those.If only Amazon was quicker to move on the simple requests of massive swaths of it's customers for one of their own products.

That might be why it's so expensive. The 1MP camera doesn't bother me as I don't use the video chat feature as I usually just use FaceTime. Sound is a bit better than the 5.UPDATE: I used the Amazon Trade-in Program where they give you X amount of money for an older Alexa device so long as your device isn't cracked. I traded in a Dot. The trade in amount was a mere $5. When they got it, they appraised it at $2 so I only got $2. I wasn't expecting that. My friend traded in his Echo. They told him it'd be $25. They sent it back to him without explanation and they kept his power supply. He spent 40 minutes on the phone being transferred to 3 people to finally get a resolution. Long story short.

You can call different devices by 5 different preselected names (Alexa, Echo, computer, and others).I really enjoy using this device in my bathroom as a tv and or video player.  When you play music from Prime Music the lyrics are displayed on the screen.There are many more skills that I have yet to review...l recommend watching some you tube videos or handbook to be sure you discover more of what the Echo 8 offers.  I know you can set reminders, conduct calls and more!!  I wish it allowed me to view Spectrum TVI can't wait to find more discoveries!Fyi... Download the Alexa app on your mobile phone.  My children can call me from the echo 8 while im at work. Lastly, Ring works well with this device.. You are notified by an alert whule being able to view any visitors at the front door or anywhere else you have a ring camera.",3
1.0,"No Music While Using Web Browser
  
","December 15, 2019",Yes,"I purchased this to use in the kitchen. If that is your intention, you need to know that the All Recipes Skill is utter garbage. There is absolutely no way for you to link your account so you won’t have access to your personal or saved recipes. Instead they will give you a few options to choose from. That’s useless to me. I finally figured out a way to access my personal recipes by using the web browser instead of using a skull. This would have been a minor inconvenience that I could live with except for one major issue. The Echo Show won’t play music and allow you to use the web browser at the same time. I always listen to music while cooking so this is an absolute deal breaker for me. It blows my mind that Amazon would design such a limited device as this when the top use of their devices is streaming music. This device doesn’t meet our needs in the least. I guess I will go back to using a tablet to look at my recipes while streaming music over a Dot. What a shame. I really thought Amazon was better than this. They really dropped the ball on what could have been a great device.",3

I will give it a few weeks to see if the software improves, but so far it takes 2-4x longer for simple commands to register compared to the original model.

3.0,"Show vs Nest - I now have both
  
","December 31, 2019",Yes,"Ok I’m not a highly knowledgeable person when it comes to tech, but I’m not a novice either. I actually bought the Show 8 and the Google Nest Hub at the same time because they were priced the same. I figured I would keep the better of the two. Nest arrived first so I set it up first. Setup was incredibly easy (I already have a nest mini), eventually easier than the Show. I also have a gmail account so that speeds up things on the Nest as well. I wasn’t keeping my photos on Google but it was pretty quick to add favorites in one folder and the Nest is now a digital photo frame. I have it on my nightstand because when you turn out the lights it really does go dark as well with a hint of the time showing - in full screen size. I am VERY sensitive to light at night and this doesn’t bother me at all. I also really like the “good morning” routine that you set up in the Nest better than the Show. It’s simple enough to ask and get info right before walking out the door.Once the Show arrived I did the setup thinking it would be easy as I have 3 dots and an Echo already. So yeah, setup went ok until you explore thinking ALL the reviews are wrong and you CAN turn off the “try this” feature. The answer is NO, you can’t. I have every part that should turn it off switched to off (even on the app). Constant “try this” on the screen. It’s ALWAYS there. And there is a list of what seems like a 100 “cards” so it never runs out. The software must’ve changed because all of the offered suggestions to turn it off aren’t accurate for what is currently possible. If you don’t care about that/wouldn’t bother you, then choose the unit that dominates your home or the website you use the most.So which is better? Meh, they’re about the same IMO. My sons and I usually have them compete with each other to see which one can answer a question accurately or with the best info. Lately there’s no clear winner on that, but Google is usually easier to understand. The Show does NOT go completely dark at night so I could never have it on my nightstand and the clock is never full screen so that’s annoying too. I have added a seasonal photo image on my amazon photo account using a computer so it’s decorative in the living room. I’m going to be installing a video doorbell myself soon and some interior cameras so I’ll update my review when those gadgets are added to compare use. Reviews I’ve read online say both units will work fine on both the doorbell and cameras so I’ll to do the installation to judge it.",2

","December 3, 2019",Yes,"Hands down, this is by far the best item I have ever purchased for myself on Amazon.I was in desperate need of replacing my alarm clock on my nightstand, so I decided to go with the Echo 8 over the Echo 5. I purchased an Echo 5 as well, which will replace my Echo dot in my kitchen where I have less space, but this is about the Echo 8.I am absolutely amazed at the sound quality for starters. This Alexa packs exceptional sound quality into it's small design. I have a subscription to Sirius XM which I have synced to play through Alexa and I am extremely impressed with the balance of the bass and treble.The screen resolution is very nice for the photo displays. You can sync an assortment of photos through the Amazon Photo app or select a category for the Echo 8 to display for you. I have not tried to watch a video yet, but with the 8"" screen it would be very easy to enjoy and much more enjoyable than trying to view on your mobile device.  The Echo 8 is actually small enough to use on a nightstand and it has a night mode which will only show the clock on a dark screen. If you have a large room like I do, I would highly recommend the Echo 8. When I turned the volume up all the way it literally made me jump while I was sitting on my bed. This is one beefy little box, that is quite amazing. It's also very easy to sync all smart plugs, lights and devices to this groovy new Alexa. I cannot recommend this highly enough!",2

The numbers and the fact it is not an AMOLED causes alot of light bleeding. Amazon please provide a AMOLED screen version. This will make a world of a difference.

I like the idea of a video hub offering the option for a backlit photo frame that shuffles photos of my choice, but the never ending dialog at the bottom of the show 8 screen ruins that for me.

2.0,"Buy the Echo Show 5 Instead
  
","December 23, 2019",Yes,"IMHO, the Echo Show 5 (FIVE) is the best all-around Echo device you can buy. It is my bedside alarm clock, and so much more. Amazon hit it out of the park with the FIVE, and I couldn't be happier.But this review isn't about the FIVE. It's about the Echo Show 8 (EIGHT), and in this case, Amazon clearly struck out.The EIGHT should have been a larger version of the FIVE. Doing so would have made up for the one area where the FIVE is somewhat lacking--sound quality. But no, Amazon decided to go off in a different direction with the EIGHT, and in doing so, made a mess of what could have been an amazing device.Is the EIGHT a good clock? No. Most of the time, the clock is shoved into the upper left-hand corner of the screen, using about 10% of the available screen space. You absolutely cannot read the time unless you are less than two feet away from the device. When the device is in night mode, the clock is shoved into the lower left-hand corner of the screen, and is about twice as large, which means you can be about four feet from the device to read the time. As a clock, the EIGHT is a complete failure.Does the EIGHT play videos? Yes; however, I have a TV, a laptop, and an iPad. If I want to watch a video, I'm going to use one of those devices.Does the EIGHT play music? Yes, and the sound is almost as good the original Echo (almost), which I still have and still use. It displays track information while playing. In some cases, it also displays lyrics. If that's important to you, it's a plus. You can also connect this to external speakers through a patch cord or Bluetooth, but if you do that, the value of the EIGHT is diminished.Is the EIGHT a digital frame? Well, it could be. It tries to be. The picture is beautiful, to be sure. It's nice to see rolling images, either stock or your own, in beautiful high-resolution color. Unfortunately, the view is interrupted by the clock in the upper right-hand corner (not a big deal) and the ever-present ""try this"" at the bottom. BTW, are digital frames even a thing anymore?I read the reviews before purchasing this, so I knew what I was getting into. But it was stupid cheap, and I couldn't pass it up at the holiday deal price, so what the heck.All things considered, the EIGHT could be great...it just isn't. Amazon blew it. It is my least favorite device and, quite frankly, not worth the price, even on sale.I'm not going to return it for two reasons. First, I knew what I was getting when I bought it, so I can't say I'm disappointed. My expectations were already low. Second, Amazon has a way if improving their devices, and the EIGHT is still relatively new in the line-up. I have expectations that Amazon will hear consumer feedback and make changes to the EIGHT that make it more like the FIVE, which is what it should have been in the first place.If you haven't purchased an EIGHT yet, don't. Get the FIVE instead. You will be far happier, especially if you want the device as a clock.",1
5.0,"This Simplifies My Life
  
","December 10, 2019",Yes,"I received my Echo Show 8 today and it's already set up and I'm very happy with it. I bought a second one, as well, to give to my mother for Christmas. I intend to buy security cameras very soon to work with Alexa, and I just purchased smart bulbs to use in my home. I also have a 43"" TCL Roku Smart TV, which I can control, to some degree, with Alexa. I'm still figuring it out, but I've been able to switch from antenna TV, and open my Hulu app on the TV through Alexa. I haven't tried asking for a specific show or channel to play, but Alexa should be able to do those commands. The Echo is in my kitchen and the TV is in my bedroom, and they communicate just fine.I was in the cleaning mood tonight, and have been listening to some great Motown through the Echo Show 8 from my Amazon Music account. I'm impressed with the speakers and clarity. They're not top of the line, but they sound great, not at all tinny.I also noticed that when I turned the lights down, the Echo automatically went into a standby mode, blank with just the time showing. The music continued to play, however. When I turned the lights back on, it woke up again, displaying song lyrics, etc. Oh, and even with the music up at its loudest, I am able to give Alexa a command without having to yell, even from across the room.The Echo does continually show suggestions at the bottom of the screen, which some people have complained about. I pretty much ignore it because I'm not usually staring at the screen for it to bother me. While it's just sitting there, it will also go through news headlines. There may be a way to change these features, but I haven't yet explored that possibility.I did, also, ask Alexa to open Hulu and started watching a show directly on the Echo, just to test it out. It worked well, and the picture looked good. I just had to sign into Hulu on the Amazon Alexa app.There's still much to learn, but overall, I can see the Echo Show 8 being a helpful and fun part of my everyday routine. I asked Alexa to set a reminder alarm, which she did, and that's going to be a huge help for me. Once I get security cameras and the lights put up, I'll be set. I resisted getting any kind of ""Smart"" device for a while, but I'm glad I finally got the Echo. I'm always looking things up on my phone, or setting alarms to remind me to do things, so this just makes staying informed and organized so much easier. I will probably get another Echo Show 8 for my room after I get the security cameras so I can check them without having to go into the kitchen.I scooped up my Echo Show 8 and my mother's during the Black Friday sale on Amazon, so I couldn't resist the price. I also got Echo Dots for my four grown daughters, and will see how they like them.UPDATE: I thought this was great. I asked Alexa for the number to Fed Ex, which she found. Then she asked if I'd like her to call them for me. I talked to Fed Ex through Alexa and the call was clear. After the call, I said, ""Alexa, hang up."" And that was it! I didn't have to pick up my phone or search for the number. I love my Echo!",1

THE MAJOR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT I ASSUMED THE LATEST GENERATION OF ECHO SHOW WOULD PROVIDE WAS AT LEAST THE SAME FUNCTIONALITY AS MY MUCH OLDER ECHO  2ND GEN ECHO TOWER.  IT IS TWO YEAR OLD NOW BUT PICKS UP YOUR VOICE TEN TIMES BETTER THAN ANY ECHO SHOW, WHICH EXPLAINS EVEN THEIR PRIMARY ECHO' SHOW'S LOW RATINGS.WHAT IS MOST ANNOYING IS MY COMMANDS TO TURN ON A PARTICULAR DEVICE WILL APPEAR TO BE ACCEPTED AND COMPLETED AS THE ECHO SHOW SHUTS OFF, BUT THE LIGHT I TOLD HER TO TURN ON IS STILL UNLIT.  I HAVE TO AGAIN ASK HER TO DO THE SAME THING AND THEN IT COMES ON.  I HAVE MANY ECHO LIGHTS, PLUGS, AND OTHER DEVICES.  MY ATTEMPTS TO TRIGGER MULTIPLE FUNCTIONS TO OCCUR BY GIVING ALEXA A COMMAND RARELY WORKS.  I HAVE ALSO NOTICES THAT THE DEVICES WITH AMAZON PLUGS THAT WERE TURNED OFF HOURS EARLIER WILL SUDDENLY BE FOUND ON, WITHOUT EXPLANATION.  HAVING TO REPEAT THE SAME COMMAND TWO TIMES BEFORE IT TURNS ON OR OFF IS REALLY ANNOYING!  I WENT INTO THE ALEXA APP AND DELETED ANY PRIOR USE OF SKILLS AND CAN NO LONGER FIND ANY THAT HAVE NOT BEEN DELETED.  YET I STILL WILL COME HOME TO FIND DEVICES (MOSTLY LIGHTS) THAT ARE SUDDENLY ON AS IF SHE IS ACTIVATING THEM AT A PREDETERMINED TIME.  YOU WILL FIND THAT ANY DEVICE THAT IS NOT MADE BY AMAZON, BUT IS COMPATIBLE WITH ALEXA, MUST BE USED TO ACTIVATE THAT PLUG OR LIGHT.  I HAVE SMART-THINGS, KASA, ETC.  THEY MUST BE USED TO CONNECT THEIR DEVICE TO YOUR HOME NETWORK. ONCE THEY ARE WORKING PROPERLY, ALEXA CAN BE USED TO ADD THEM BUT WHAT IS NEEDED IS ONE CENTRAL ICON THAT CONTROLS EVERYTHING.  I'VE HAD SO MANY PROBLEMS TRYING TO USE THE VOICE COMMAND WITH ALEXA WITHOUT HAVING TO REPEAT IT 2-3 TIMES BEFORE A LIGHT GOES OFF THAT I'M READY TO SEND THE THING BACK.  THE LEARNING CURVE FOR ALEXA IS MUCH GREATER THAN IT NEEDS TO BE.  THE TERMS THAT AMAZON USES TO DESCRIVE CERTAIN FUNCTIONS ARE JUST NOT COMMON AND I WOULD NEVER REMEMBER TO SAY THEM IN ORDER FOR ALEXA TO TURN LIGHTS ON AND BEGIN PROVIDING THE DAILY WEATHER, NEWS ETC.  RATHER AN REQUESTING SHE PROVIDE YOUR MORNING NEWS AS SELECTED WHEN IT WAS SET UP, I HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT ITS NOT THE NEWS, ITS MY ""FLASH BRIEFING"".  WHEN I FIRST WAKE UP, I CAN'T REMEMBER TO USE A PHRASE THAT I'VE NEVER USED IN MY LIFE AND JUST ISN'T SOMETHING THAT SEEMS NECESSARY.  IF THEIR AI WAS A ONE FIRMWARE UPGRADE UP, ALEXA SHOULD ALLOW ME TO NAME MY ""SKILL"" WHICH IS ANOTHER WORD THAT JUST DOESN'T FIT THE PROCESS BEING PROGRAMMED.  FINALLY, ALEXA IS FAR FROM BEING READY FOR PRIME TIME BUT SIRI OR HEY GOOGLE ARE NO BETTER.  WHAT BOTHERS ME IS THE ECHO MODEL (SPECIFICALLY THE ECHO SHOW) HAS ITS VISUAL BENEFITS, HOWEVER, TO GAIN THOSE BENEFITS I FEEL I HAVE LOST THE BASIC FUNCTIONALITY OF MY FORMER ECHO TOWER.  WHEREVER THEY PLACED THE MICROPHONE ON THE ECHO SHOW, UNLIKE THE ROUND ECHO TOWER THAT PICKS UP YOUR VOICE FROM ANY DIRECTION, THE ECHO SHOW CAN ONLY HEAR FROM THE FRONT OF THE UNIT.  IF THE TELEVISION IS ON, SHE WILL RARELY GET THAT I SAID CORRECTLY ALTHOUGH I AM SPEAKLING LOUDLY AND CLEARLY.  I CAN'T PROVIDE A REMINDER UNLESS I GO THROUGH FOUR STEPS. FORST TO NOTIFY ALEXA THAT I HAVE A NEW REMINDER, SHE WILL ASK WHAT IT IS BUT I CANNOT PROVIDE HER WHAT THE REMINDER IS  WHILE ALSO TELLING HER THE DATE AND TIME.  SHE WILL IGNORE IT EVERYTHING BUT WHAT THE REMINDER IS AND THEN ASK ME WHEN WHAT DATE AND TIME OF THE REMINDER.  I A POSITIVE I NEVER HAD TO DO THAT IN THE PAST.  SHE responds FROM HER ONLY RECORDING WHATEVER THE REMINDER IS BUT I MUST WAIT FOR HER TO ASK FOR THE DATE AND TIME.  I DON'T REMEMBER HAVING TO DO THAT WITH MY ALEXA ECHO TOWER???  IT TAKES SO MANY STEPS, I STOPPED USING IT.  APPARENTLY THE ALEXA APP ON MY PHONE IS THE PRIMARY BRAINS BUT EVERY ALEXA DEVICE IS NOT CREATED EQUALLY AND THE SOFTWARE THAT DRIVES IT IS UNIQUE TO THE DEVICE.  I HAVE EVEN BEGUN TO USE ANY OF THE FEATURES THE ECHO SHOW IS KNOWN FOR.  I AM CURIOUS AS TO WHY THE ECHO SHOW WANTS TO DEFAULT TO CONNECTING VIA BLUETOOTH WHEN WI-FI HAS SUCH GREATER DISTANCE.  IF I ASK ALEXA A QUESTION SUCH AS, ""DO YOU KNOW WHEN THE HEISMAN TROPHY PRESENTATION WILL BE BROADCAST ON TV""?  THAT REQUEST CAUSES HER TO GO INTO CONVULSIONS.  SHE DOESN'T HAVE A CLUE WHAT THE QUESTION WAS AND BEGINS GIVING ME A HISTORY LESSON OF WHEN THE HEISMAN TROPHY WAS FIRST INTRODUCED.  TRYING TO INTERRUPT HER TO SHUT HER UP IS NEAR IMPOSSIBLE.  SHE IS DEFINITELY FEMALE.

My daughter had briefly moved her dot in her room and we discovered me using the show in the kitchen (near her room) was setting off her dot too, so she moved hers back and away from her door.I've been playing music (spotify) in my office and walked into the kitchen to see if it would play on both devices, or what would happen. It picked up where the office one left off, the office one stopped, but when I went back into the office (much later), what was playing in the kitchen did not start in the office. It's not a big enough deal to me to go see how to fix it, but in case anyone was wanting that functionality, you may want to look that up.I'm pleased with the size, I was hoping I wouldn't regret not getting the larger one, but I don't.

","December 30, 2019",Yes,"If your main reason for buying the Echo 8 is a bigger screen, go for it.  It does that about as well as you would expect.  Everything else, except perhaps sound quality, puts it behind the Echo 5 in terms of quality and extras.The screen, while larger, seems a bit washed out to me, compared to the 5. You have far fewer customization options in terms of clock faces and backgrounds.  You would expect better sound quality given the larger cabinet and (presumably) larger speaker. But it's really not that much better. Marginally perhaps.Also, since it has a bigger screen and the same wedge form factor as the 5, the entire device is much much larger, which might not make it suitable in places where space is at a premiumI wanted it mainly for the kitchen, for calling up recipes, which are easier to see, with less scrolling, than on the smaller Echo 5 screen. Mission accomplished there, although it is so large, it barely fits where I wanted to put. And was a bit disappointed at all the other downgrades.One upside it it seems to handle wakeup better than the 5. Not sure why but the 5 always seemed a bit hard of hearing.  Perhaps because I have so many other Alexa devices scattered about the house and they were all fighting for control. The whole ESP thing that is supposed to make the closest one respond didnt work very well with the 5. This one is very responsive unless there is a lot of ambient noise.",1

","December 6, 2019",Yes,"Ok, so like, a decade ago I was an early adopter of the Sony Dash, it was a small tabletop alarm clock that could show you facebook posts, play music, play Netflix, and a bunch of other stuff. The thing about the Sony Dash was that it completely sucked! The interface was clunky, the home screen was not customizable and the video playback was always choppy. After a few years Sony stopped supporting the device all together and it became a paper weight. This was probably somewhere in 2008-2009. Well, ten years later I just picked up the Amazon Echo 8 and I blown away at how awesome it is! The sound quality is GREAT! The screen is beautiful! The ease of use is amazing. Within minutes I had it connected to Prime Video, XM satellite radio, and all the other stuff. I highly recommend this as an addition to any room. I am blown away!",2

","December 19, 2019",Yes,"The screen quality is excellent, the sound quality is very good, and the features are many.  In fact, that is a problem starting out.  There is no manual and online help is limited.  I suppose I could spring another $10 for a book, but why?  I'm already not happy that there is no pre-booking guarantee.  I pre-ordered for $99, and the day it arrived the price was $79, but I cannot get the lower price.There are many features but getting the most out of them is not always easy.  For example, the alarm has a repeat function for daily, weekly, weekends, or week days.  I work a rotating schedule so the days I need an alarm rotate every two weeks.  After a couple of weeks, I discovered if I touch the date once I set an alarm, I can get a calendar.  This way I can program just the days I want the alarm.  Too bad there isn't a manual to look this up.I'm sure the Echo Show will be more useful once I add more Alexa hardware and apps.  As it is, I'm turning on lights, setting the thermostat, utilizing time, temp, and alarm, listening to music, and watching video.  Other thing is, my wife hates to talk to Alexa.  Not sure what do about adding that app.",1

I made the mistake of setting up initially with my phone and email thinking I could easily edit it later. That was a huge mistake! It required a couple of lengthy phone calls to Amazon to get my cell phone number disassociated and their number associated.Also, on one of those calls, I had the person tell me that my Amazon account and my Alexa account are linked. They are not!If you don’t want to give access to all your phone’s contact, you can set up contacts separately but it’s not at all intuitive. It took me a while to figure it out.

","December 21, 2019",Yes,The Alexa voice activation was inconsistent and required the end user to set up and document what verbal constructs actually work to achieve the goal. The program should act to recognize when the user is trying to  achieve some outcome and when it is finally reached identify the verbal sequence and relate it to the many attempts used before success and recognize these when they occur again. Now  a long process of learning what phrases in what gramatical order and  using which descriptors is required in all but the simplest of requests. Documentation is limited and aside from purchasing books written by authors who have puzzeled out the supposed manual of operation there is sparse and incomplete online content provided.

Like we already drank the Alexa Kool Aid, stop trying to sell us. But anyway besides that it’s great. I’m apple products through and through. Then I got an echo dot with my fire stick purchase and we loved it. I have a ring doorbell, so I wanted it to work with that, and auto show me the doorbell instead of having to look at our phones. And it works great, kind of. You still have to say “Alexa show me the front door”. Kind of frustrating that it’s already communicating with the doorbell. It rings and tells you someone’s at the door. Why can’t it auto show the camera feed when someone rings? Hopefully a future update. But all other aspects of it are great. Screen looks great. It sounds great.

I have not had a chance to try out the camera or video calling as of yet due to not knowing anyone with an echo 8 :-(  make sure you purchase the stand this keeps it from directly sitting flat on surfaces and protects from accidental spills little pricey tho but worth it.

3.0,"Very Good Device, but still has Flaws..
  
","January 10, 2020",Yes,"First off, Kudos to amazon for doing right by me when my discontinued Echo spot started acting up.  They gave me the full purchase price as a credit toward the Show 8.  Ended up only costing me $5 with the $99 sale price.So now to the review.  It should be noted that I have a Show 5 as well, so I will make a couple of references when going over features and function.  To start, as HUGE plus is the ability to physically disable the camera.  This is something that the show 5 had but the Echo Spot didn't.  Its nice having the peace of mind not having to worry about anyone's privacy, no matter what room the device is in.The Screen is HUGE, bright and clear.  Its nice not having to watch distorted videos on a round screen.  Its a great price point between the show 5 and the original Echo Show.  The camera is the same as the Show 5 @ 1mp, more then enough for video chat.  It looks clear, with now distortions. This of course will depend on your internet/WiFi connectivity. The sound quality is very good.  Its not a $2k audio system, but its not a cheep pair of headphones ether...  The sound is rich and full and quite enjoyable.  Functionally its like any other Alexa device.Now for the issues.  The two big ones, and the reason for knocking off the 2 stars, is first, the LIMITED availability of clock face customization.  If you go to settings and select clock &amp; faces, all you can pick is the clock background.  The HUGE face, and the time is limited to being displayed in one corner.  The Show 5 had all kinds of face options, but this one only lets you pick the backgrounds.  Yes you can have a photo or something from Facebook, a couple of ugly pictures and a single semi solid background, but that's it.  You should at the very least be able to have the time take up most of the screen to be able to see it at night or from across the room.  The show 5 has customization, why is it not part of the Show 8 as wellThe other one is an annoyance with every screen based Alexa device I have ever owned.  YOU CAN NOT DISABLE THE ""THINGS TO TRY"" TEXT.  Its in the middle of, or on the bottom of almost EVERY card that the device displays.  You can turn off everything else, but not that....  I want to have it rotate between time &amp; weather...  THAT'S ALL.  If I need to find new things to try I will look it up myself....  This has annoyed me and A LOT of other people for a very long time.  Come on Amazon, lets have a way to turn this off.Overall I am happy, and hopeful that Amazon will listen and get us some updates real soon...  I'll update this if anything else happens.",0
5.0,"Music and Photos With Built in Video - What's Not to Love
  
","December 30, 2019",Yes,"After 16 years of marriage my husband I have arrived at a stage in our life where gift giving is no longer relegated to birthdays and holidays because we have the disposable income of an established couple with no children. In short, if we want something, we buy it. Christmas gift giving was once an ungodly stressful event  until we decided to stop with the gifts. This year however, I saw the Echo Show and decided to take a chance and surprise my favorite spouse with a present for his work office. He loves having family photos on display, but his iPad is old and does not always connect to the very secure office network and he enjoys playing music, but he needs to have his phone available for calls and his work computer is a PC and cannot hold personal files. The Show is really the perfect solution.When he opened the box his first reaction was suspicion because our house is currently overflowing with Alexas. We have so many Alexas in fact that there is an unopened Dot on our dining room table, we sent two brand new Dots to my brother and we have an older Dot that will be needing a new home after its replacement arrives next week. Once I started to explain the features of the Show a bit of excitement started to build. I knew I had him hooked when he plugged it in immediately and asked Alexa to play music and the lyrics popped up on the screen so he could sing along. ""This is pretty cool.""Then he started tweaking the settings and the home screen and added a background photo. It was all very easy. I use Amazon Photo storage as a backup tool for all of my family photographs. There are currently around 20,000 photos that are thankfully loosely organized into albums. I spent a good 4 hours creating a new 250 photo Echo Show album and then because my husband is a family vault member and can see all of my photos he can add photos to the album. The slideshow feature is really his favorite part of the whole Show. He loves the music, he loves Alexa, but he really loves having photos on his desk.The Echo Show's first week in his office was a success and when his boss stopped by his office, she loved the Show so much she ordered her own. My husband is able to listen and sing along to his music and see his family. We ordered a Show for our kitchen and my parents ordered one for their kitchen so we can easily make video calls between all of us during the day. Now if anyone can tell me what to do with all of these Dots, I would really appreciate it.",0

3.0,"Pretty Cool, it's the same old Alexa with a screen.
  
","January 5, 2020",Yes,"I wasn't really expecting to be blown away by this item, and I'm really not. It does give you that futuristic feeling like your in the movie Aliens and Sigourney Weaver is calling you, getting you out of a sound sleep to make sure you're not bringing them back to study!! ha. First thing that came to mind when I used the Camera. Which is a nice feature, though 1MP, that's a little strange. Though it's pretty clear. But a little ""invasive"" with the drop in feature, which can be adjusted. The screen is VERY touch sensitive, which is good if you use it, and that's actually, rarely. Since the voice recognition is excellent.I find myself mostly using my voice most, since that's really what it's designed for. Alexa is integrated MUCH better and she it super responsive, compared to the old models. Almost overly so. The screen isn't really that bright which is good, and it's not a strain on the eyes. However I don't picture myself watching much on Amazon Prime Video on this device. For that it's really for the ""Kitchen"" area for people who spend time in their cooking, eating, or sitting working on something at the table. Then i can picture it being like a small TV in the background like from the 80's, when people use to keep up on their Soap Operas.My biggest disappointment overall it the sound, louder isn't always ""better"". The lack of high end just really doesn't cut it for me when I'm listening to music on it. It seems to have good panning, but the bass (on this model) is just to overwhelming in my opinion. Even when Alexa speaks it's very very low end, even boomy. But for the price, it's a very cool gadget. The wireless works perfect, and the range is incredible. Probably the best I've seen on anything, no interruptions, pausing, stuttering, or anything like that. So if you're in the market for a ""New Alexa"" this one is the right price, and I definitely recommend it over the others. Even next to your bed you may want to watch a short episode of your favorite sitcom or something. But whole movies? Not so much. So I like it, and it's very innovative. I see why they don't stay on the shelves in stores. A solid 3.5......btw AMAZON this is YOUR product, can you let us reviewers have ""half"" a star for pity sake? ha....ENJOY!!!",0

4.0,"Pretty good... but hopefully it will improve with time
  
","December 22, 2019",Yes,"I bought the Echo Show 8 as a Christmas gift for my wife, who wanted to use it in the kitchen. She was a bit heartbroken over the the ""things to try"" scrolling non-stop across the screen, we were going to return the unit. However, Amazon must have gotten many complaints because they got rid of it. Once that was fixed we set about figuring out how to use it. More on that in the Good/Could be better below.Mounting:Our kitchen is tiny, so the only option was to mount it below a cabinet. Note that there is no provision to mount it this way. I had to make a mount that curled down and around the back to the bottom. There is a metal plate on the bottom of the Echo Show 8 and it can be secured with a large magnet.. which is what I did. Because we are tight on counter space, I made the mount on a rail that allows the whole unit to be slid back under the cabinet to get it out of the way (you can see this in the pictures I included.)  If we had a bit more room we would have just set it on the counter or picked up one of the many mounts available.The good:The screen is bright, clear and adapts nicely to changes in ambient light. The clock is useful. You can load your own pics so it rotates through them, making a nice picture frame (my wife loves this.) When you ask for the weather it gives a nice display of the hourly temps/forecast, or a weeks overview, depending on what you ask for (see pic.) The speaker is adequate. Alexa does all the things available on Dot or other device: runs routines, turns lights on and off, has the Guard feature, etc.  The Echo Show 8 is useful for viewing security cameras, we have some Wyze cameras and we can just ask ""Alexa, show me the entrance"" and in a few seconds, its on the screen (see pic.) When you play music, the Echo 8 displays the lyrics. If you set a countdown timer while cooking, it remains on the screen. If you set two timers, it shows the one that is going to go off first, then shows the second: my wife loves this for cooking (she used to have to keep asking Alexa ""how much time is left on the timer?"" as she tried to coordinate multiple items being readied. You can watch movies on the Echo Show 8 as well, probably not the best screen for viewing, but it does work.To be frank, the Echo 8 earns its keep just on the above features.The ""could be better"":When looking up recipes, the Echo 8 displays them one at a time. It is exactly like an Echo Dot, except there is a picture - the screen could be utilized to show multiple possibilities and cut the browsing time down tenfold. There is no provision to enter and save your own recipes, my wife still gets out her Ipad and uses that.  Amazon says there are thousands of skills, but the majority of them are at best, kinda lame (having the Gordon Ramsey skill make rude comments about food was funny for about 15 seconds.) Like the recipe function, very few of the skills are optimized to work with a screen in a helpful way... this is an area that really disappointed us. I was expecting something that could work more like a tablet in capabilities.We have multiple Alexa Dots throughout the house, and their capabilities have grown tremendously over the past two years. Many of the capabilities were unexpected and very useful, such as Guard and geofencing, both of which we now use daily.  I suspect, and hope, that the Echo Show 8 evolves in the same way.",0
5.0,"Not Just A Glorified Alarm Clock...
  
","November 29, 2019",Yes,"I have been reading the Amazon Echo 5 reviews for quite sone time and trying to make up my mind on if I should buy it or not.  When I saw the pre-order starting for Echo Show 8 I was not sure if I was going to get it or not but I put my name on the list anyway.  Before the Echo Show arrived I planned on it just basically being a clock for me but I was wrong!  I had every plan of holding onto my alarm clock even after I set up the Echo Show in my apartment but it did not work out that way.  I saw the “skill” for this speaker to play my Apple Music so that was the first thing that I tried because I wanted to see if it had good speaker quality like my Wonderboom blue tooth speaker which is my usual way of listening to my playlists.  It exceeded my expectations and since I set it up I have not turned on my Wonderboom speaker at all which is amazing to me because I like quality sound.  Even stopping the music for a few minutes is easily done with a voice command.  I am, and have been a longtime fan of everything Apple.  I do have an Amazon Kindle Fire but thought that would be it for me with Amazon’s devices.  I thought that I would have as much of a “problem” as quite a few others had with the things that come across  the Echo’s screen but to my surprise it is not bothersome at all to me.  I have long liked Apple’s customer service and when I purchased my smart tv and my sound bar I saw that one of the services Amazon provided was customer support.  My friend had set up the tv and the soundbar for me and he relied heavily on this service that Amazon provided in setting it up with the soundbar.  While I was confident that I would not need to use this service when I set up the Echo Show I figured that it would be fairly easy but was happy that if a problem arises and I cannot figure it out that I could always call and find an answer from Amazon.  I saw that on Black Friday (today) that the selling price is lower than I bought it for ($99) but that was to be expected.  I just decided that I would write a review on this product since it seemed ironic to me that I chose Amazon over Apple in this type of device.  I was seriously thinking I would stay with my plan of buying the Apple Home Pod because of the critical reviews of “ads” on the Show but I see I am wrong with that.  Since I have set this unit up I see that it has surpassed my expectations because it is a great product that not only has great sound, it also has good clarity on the screen.  The only problem I have encountered with the Echo Show, and it is not much of  a problem, is to remember to say Alexa instead of Siri.  Since I have only a small efficiency apartment (400 square feet) I do not need another Echo Show but if I did I would not hesitate to purchase another one of these units.  For me to write something like this for an Amazon product it is a pleasant surprise because I myself rely heavily on all reviews because they are very valuable in deciding what to purchase since I am on a small fixed income and I figured there are so many reviews of the Echo Show that I wouldn’t have to bother with that but I changed my mind after seeing this is a wonderful product.  Thank you Amazon for giving such good quality for such a small purchase!  I would not hesitate to even buy one as a present for somebody if they wanted something like this.UPDATE-I decided to call customer service since I was not happy with seeing the selling price go from $129.99 to $99 and now to $79.  I usually never call for things like this but I was very happy with the agent telling me that I will get a promotional discount which is very good for me since I am on a very small fixed income.  Thank you Amazon your customer service is always good!",0

At first I felt guilty removing Alexa, especially since she was one of the original beta tester echoes. But Alexa had been knocked off of the end table one too many times by the cats, leaving her top a bit crooked and wonky. Although she did still sound great, sometimes she had a bit of trouble hearing and we found ourselves yelling and repeating ourselves one too many times, it was time to send her to the old hobby closet.This echo show 8 is very nice, it was super easy to set up and the picture quality and sound are excellent. Alexa responds quickly and I don't have to yell or repeat myself making my neighbors think a crazy lady lives here. I'm also happy I chose the 8 instead of the smaller 5. I enjoy the screen size, and along with a nice magnetic swivel stand I bought to go with it, it looks and fits great on the end table. It would also work great on the kitchen counter or anywhere else in the house.This echo works great with our security system, I just ask Alexa to ""show me -name of camera-"" and it's super easy to make calls and check your calendar and emails if you need to. Running smart home controls is also easy to do. Touch screen and voice control are both very responsive. I also love the slide lock button to block the camera when it's not in use, it kept me from having to place one more piece of black tape over a camera lens!The lighting also dims (can turn feature off in settings) as it gets darker so it doesn't light up the room at night. However you can still see the time dimly lit from across the room, I like this feature so I haven't checked to see if you can remove the time from showing when it's dark.I'm still getting to know what I can and cannot do with this echo show, but so far I'm loving it and I have no regrets whatsoever with my purchase.",0

I got it because I thought I wanted a bigger screen and a better speaker. Both of these reason didn't pan out. If I wasn't so lazy I would return it for a second Google Nest hub or a straight echo speaker.The Far field mics on most Alexa devices are great including this one.

Also read a couple reviews that claimed to instruct how to turn this ""feature"" off.So, after getting the Show 8 going, there were the never-ending things to try on the screen.

","December 19, 2019",Yes,"Echo Show 8 - HD 8"" smart display with Alexa is something that I bought specifically to watch the streams from my Wyze cameras.  It does that very well but it is the “Try, ‘Alexa ----’ “  feature that some people find annoying that I like so much that I purchased a second device.The screen changes with different news items or informational comments and across the bottom of the screen a tag line shows the exact phrasing to use if one wants to know more.  This helps to avoid frustration when struggling to phrase a question or command that Alexa will immediately understand.  The “Try,’ Alexa ----’ ” is also a great prompt for those who are just getting used to AI and not quite sure of how to use it or what to say.I have Alexa Echo audio devices in every room along with the other leading AI assistant.  I find that I can avoid frustration when one of the AI assistants fails to understand me, or can not help me with that yet, to be able to ask the other and usually get a response.Now that displays are becoming the norm I decided to trade up.  I find it really helps to see a visualization of the response. I particularly like seeing lyrics to songs.  It is also nice to be able to set the home screen to present what one’s wants.  The sound on this 8” Echo Show is excellent.Echo Show 8 - HD 8"" smart display with Alexa is an ideal size for a kitchen counter or nightstand.

","January 4, 2020",Yes,"We have been using an ECHO unit for about 3 years and have been very happy with it. With the recent version 2 upgrade to the ECHO Show, and with the recent addition of grandchildren living 8 hours away, we decided to try the Show 8 out.The unit installation was a super simple plug-an-play using the Alexa app. Amazon has certainly made the start up for their products super simple. We moved the ECHO to the master bedroom, and the ECHO Dot to a different location.After 2 weeks we are VERY happy with it. We are able to do visual phone calls with our son and family (they upgraded to a Show 8, also). We have  added the Recipe Speak skill, uploaded a lot of our recipes, and like the visual functionality. We use Our Groceries (we love it) and can now get a visual on what is on the list(s). There are other things we are trying as we learn what can be done.The sounds seems to be very good, also. The better sound may be a function of the unit sitting in a corner up against two walls.Why 4 versus 5 stars?  The ECHO Show 8's bottom is set so that the screen tilts backward slightly; there is no way to adjust this tilt. Because of the location of our unit we either have to stand up to look straight into the screen for a phone call or prop the back up with a small block so we can sit down. Adjustable stands are available, and we will order one, but I think that some type of tilt device, even a very simple one, should come with the unit.",0

How they could have refurbished units within days of the release of a new product is unclear.The replacement had a different problem.  After being on for 15 or 20 minutes, the Echo 8 refused to respond to an Alexa command. It simply stayed on with what was playing even when screaming Alexa right over it.  The Amazon technician I called couldn’t believe it either. We spent nearly an hour going back to the beginning with restoring to factory settings.  We agreed to keep it playing and have her call me after 30 minutes to see if the Alexa command could get it to stop playing.  She did call back as promised and, guess what, the fix took.  Alexa did her job.  I praised the technician for her expertise and effort and thought a new day had begun.Except it hadn’t.  The next day it was as if nothing had been done.  The Echo 8 refused to respond to the off or stop command, making it necessary to disconnect the power.A day later I am still wondering what to.  Should I call tech support and go through another remedial effort which will probably fail or should I ask for a third unit, one which is new and not refurbished?  Or how about a third option: request a refund and send it back?  I would easily opt for choice 3 if the picture and sound weren’t so great.  They are outstanding.  To be or not to be.",0

In the first two days with the product, I have had to call Amazon Support 4 times to get instructions on how Echo Show works with Amazon Photo. to do basic things like upload a photos, creating photo albums and adding additional photos to these photo albums...and these are all fundamentally basic capabilities.  In total, I have spent more than 3 hours on these 4 support calls because after about 30-45 mins of fumbling around, the Amazon support person has told me that they are really not that familiar with the Show product or with Amazon Photo product and they transfer me to someone else...who has more knowledge of the products.  These new support persons have access to ""step by step"" instructions (or can direct me to the Help section) with these ""step by step"" instructions to do specific tasks.  But even then, they cannot find or direct me to any ""step by step"" help to work with things like Photo Albums...If this Echo Show product is going to really be successful, Amazon needs to provide users like me with documentation on all of the products features and ""step by step"" instructions on how to take advantage and use these features.

I'm not sure why a larger version should have problems but I wish now I'd bought another Echo Show 5 instead as I would have a working unit for my living room now instead of a defective one.The problem seems to be the software. It keeps hanging up and the only way around it is to disconnect the power and then repower the unit and hope you can get through the part that hung up on you before. One menu required moving my finger up, to scroll down, instead of the usual moving the finger down to scroll down. That was totally weird.I am disappointed because I ordered the two Echo Shows as my main Christmas presents to myself. I wanted the 10s but I read they weren't very good for the almost double price. And the 8 is really big enough for what I want it to do--if it would do it.So my Christmas tree isn't going to have much under it this year which is a shame as this will probably be my last Christmas due to cancer. At least the Echo Show, due after Christmas, is from a different batch so maybe it will work right out of the box like my Echo 5.",0

The trick is selecting what works and applies to your needs without getting sucked into marketing and pointless features. With all that said, I’d say the echo 8 comes right where we wanted to land as a family.We originally purchased an echo 5 on Black Friday. While it’s great for the price, it’s small and the speakers are lacking when it comes to playing audio with any volume. The 8 definitely delivers over the 5 in terms of audio quality. Much clearer and robust.Larger screen is a big plus with better quality picture. This isn’t a device I’d expect or demand 4K in. 1080 is fine. Nothing is generally grainy or hard to see. It’s the right size for a kitchen without being excessive and space demanding.Performance wise it’s fast. Does a great job with home automation and commands. I like the shutter for the camera and button to cut the mic off.The only ding I’d give it is it should have the option of being a true smart hub. I would love to attach my z wave devices to it and remove the entirety of a secondary controller. I know the larger show does have some of these functions but at a much larger size it wasn’t what we wanted. Add in the extra cost, the show 8 was a winner for us.I’d recommend it to anyone who wants a good kitchen companion. The off white color is a nice compliment to kitchens.

If they allowed you to get rid of that, this would be a five star review.  Unfortunately, I don't ever see that changing.  My other big complaint is the clock.  The 8"" version is right in between the 5"" and the 10"", but the time is really small in the upper right corner and cannot be changed like the 5"" version.  Amazon should have the same options as the 5"" versions.  I just want this as a larger clock during the day.  However, you almost need glasses to see the time from a distance as it is way too small.  They really did not think this echo show out.  Designers of this really need to go back to the drawing board and rethink this one out before updating the next version of software.  I will probably end up sending this one back and waiting for them to fix these issues if they ever do before purchasing again.  In the mean-time, I would stay with the 5"" or the 10"" for now.  The sound is good, but the 10"" is still better.  BTW, for those of you who do want to use this in a bedroom on a nightstand next to your bed, beware that dark mode is so bright that it will pretty much light up the room with a warm glow.

I can ask it to find a recipe for X on website Y (or just look across the web), and it'll display all the relevant recipes. I can scroll through them, then pick one to see the details. It even links the ingredients to the shopping list in the Alexa app. When using a recipe, the display stays open and you can easily scroll through the different steps. It sits at an angle which makes it easy to read ( I didn't get a stand). Much better than using my tablet, which times out after a few minutes, so I have to keep logging in.For music, it visually displays all the available playlists, which I can scroll through and pick one. It displays the current song and performer. So much easier than using an Echo Dot.

The $80 price tag is insanely good for the speaker and screen quality.While I do wish it was more customizable like others have said as for removing the ‘Try This’ im sure it will happen eventually and every single person mentioning it is redundant. The Echo Show 5 is a worthless paper weight as for its speaker and screen size, its smaller then most current phone screens, and sounds like trash. As for a bedroom clock, or background music, or digital picture frame for the bedroom it may serve a purpose, it doesnt have a place anywhere else really. The Echo Show 8, while only being 2.5” bigger, is a perfect size for a main room that doesnt have a big enough space to dedicate to the full size Echo Show, or as a cheaper alternative, or as a secondary Echo Show.

It was like new out of the box when I sent it in.  I wrapped it in bubble wrap and newspaper and dropped it off at UPS.  Now they rejected the suggested $30 discount and have charged my credit card.  The reason?  Scratches.  Absolutely no way there was a single scratch on that unit.  I'll be interested in seeing the condition it's in when it is returned.  I won't every use that Ugrade and Trade-in offer again.Update:  After a couple of weeks I just received my old unit back.  I was anxious to see the ""scratches"" that they claimed were the reason they didn't accept it.  Of course, there weren't ANY, not a single scratch.  But the best part, wait for it... is that they returned it without the cord.  So now, if I want to sell it I have to buy a $15 cord for it.  This trade-in program is a scam and I am really surprised Amazon is okay with it.  Basically, they lure you in with a higher amount and ask you to ok ahead if they feel it is worth less (which it always is, I'm sure).

","January 4, 2020",Yes,"The Echo Show 8 is a good piece of hardware marred by a software design that makes you scratch your head, largely because the numerous requests and feedback from users of the larger Show is largely ignored in this implementation.The display is great, the built in pictures are also great, and the scrolling weather, news and other functions work well.The issues.1. There is no way to have a larger clock in ""standard"" mode.  It's a small little clock in the corner, and even if you turn off all the info scrolling options like news, weather, etc. It stays this small little clock with a bunch of empty screen space. Do not disturb allows for a larger clock, but is a poor implementation of allowing it as it literally shuts everything else off.2. Do not disturb in the menu says it turns the screen off, but actually leaves the screen on and just gives you a larger clock.  It should turn the screen off as stated and there should be a separate mode for displaying a larger clock.3. Night mode is still WAY too bright and there's no way to adjust it or dim it down. Nor any option to configure it so that night mode is just a clock, no picture.Now, if this was a first try, these things would be forgivable as they worked through what the end user wanted.  The issue?  The Google Home Hub has been out for over a year and literally has NONE of these issues as they got all of these wrongs right.  Want a full screen clock.  Check.  Want a proper dnd mode?

The echo 8 breaks free of all the negative aspects of the echo 5. If you are looking for something to watch video on and listen to music the echo 8 is a much better choice. The volume is louder and the bass is surprisingly good for this type of device. You can feel the bass. It also playa hulu and more video options than the echo 5. Its not a fire tv replacement as not all video apps work on the echo shows. The big echo obviously has a larger screen and its significantly more expensive. If watching video is your top concern stick to the 10 inch or the echo 8. If having a bedside smart device to control smart devices, wake you up and use for communication the echo 5 is the best option. The echo 5 is surprisingly unobtrusive on the nightstand where as the echo 8 is pretty noticeable. The echo 8 is a great value at the current sale price. If your on the fence buy it!

I think the overall experience is getting better. With the screen, I can find Audible books fairly easily. The books synch  pretty well with my smartphone. I like that there is no downloading, they just stream. A lot of the videos that come up are interesting. You can hone things to what you want like the stock market or NFL scores, etc. If I want to hear a song, I can generally just ask for it, but it helps to have the Unlimited service, not the free one.

Its as though the designers pictured it only being used on a desk and not as an alarm clock  or, perhaps sitting under a television or other tythings that people could have thought to do with it.But it would be nice if there were a way to get rid of the ""Suggestions"" that keep turning up on the lower part of the display.It wold also be 100% better if you could make it act like a regular ol' digital clock and only chnge screens when you ask it to do something.  Unlike the the Show 5, you can't change clock faces so you are stuck with the clock face that is too small to read from across a room.  There is a larger clock face that would be OK if you could keep it on the display instead of it changing to the small one periodically  no matter what settings you change.Virtually all settings must be one on the display itself.  It would be useful to be able to change the settings from the Alexa App.",0

The sound quality was MUCH more to my liking,  The Echos, especially the Dots, sound rather muddy to me, even with my excellent hearing aids (I have high-frequency drop-off).  But, this 8"" Show is very clear, and it easily fills a living room-dining room area.  I like that the screen dims in a dark room, meaning that I might splurge on a second Show for my bedroom to get better sound.  I also like that when I play selections from TuneIn Radio, the artwork shows on the screen. But, there are times when I would like to just return the screen to a persistent plain one, like whenit shows time and weather.  That's my only real objection.

The Echo Show 8"" is really amazing with the sturdy magnetic stand they sell for it. Echo Show 8"" even scrolls stuff across the screen giving you ideas you can try and not just for the Echo Show 8"" either. Now because of this item, I know so many more things I can do with my Echo Dot 3rd generation! The Show new everything about me. Integrated easily with my Dots. I learned you can ask Alexa who am I? Then if she doesn't know, she'll tell them who's Echo it is and ask you your name. Then when you tell her ,she'll ask if you want her to set up a voice profile you say yes. Then she will start calling you by your name. You can do that both on the Echo Show 8"" and the Echo Dot.

The music plays really well on it, i love being able to ask Alexa to play music while I do dishes or cleaning around the house, especially when i can ask her to play a specific song! Even the suggestions on “learn how to make this food!” Which gives us more suggestions on foods I haven’t even thought about. Plus the weather for the day and just minor things Alexa can do! I think it’s great it rotates with different things and we can still see the time at the top corner. I’ve been recommending it to everyone!

A real bummer as the Saver resolution is not satisfactory for me.

Sometimes Alexa says OK then shortly announces ""Something must have gone wrong"".Blink reportedly has actually been aware of the problem for months and is promising a fix in the future but is not saying when. If it is taking so long to fix it must be a major flaw or it is a ""back burner"" project for them. I have not seen anything in either the Blink or Show documentation/advertising that lets customers know NOT to expect integration in anything but the ""Saver"" mode.Needless to say I am not a pleased customer.

Unfortunately, I found it just doesn't work. If it has for others, would love to hear about it. Spent hours on my own troubleshooting. Then tonight spent an hour on the phone with Amazon tech support. That's a lot of time wasted only to find that there just doesn't seem to be any way to get two Show 8's working as a stereo pair. Since I have no idea if its a bug, or one or both units malfunctioning, I'll now have to return all of it, including 2 Dots that came with the Show 8's on a holiday sale/promotion. Very disappointing. Hope they work out the bugs and get it working as is promised. Seems like a device with a lot of potential, but for me it was just wasted time.EDIT:  After hours and hours of wasted troubleshooting an Amazon staff member got back to me on their device forum advising Amazon's info on their Compatible Echo Devices page was WRONG!  Wasted a ton of time, money, and now even more time for returns because of Amazon's misinformation about the stereo pairing for these!  Ask me how annoyed I am at this moment?? Nice of Amazon to apologize on their forum for my ""inconvenience"". Lot of good that does me!!!  P.S. While they've now corrected their compatibility for stereo pairing page they've left questions answered here that still contain the wrong information.

I wasn’t sure if I should get the Echo Show 5 or 8 to use as a replacement alarm clock and radio in the bedroom. I went with the Echo Show 8 and I am so happy with the purchase. I was nervous that it might be too big or too loud. The size is perfect and it sits on a night stand with a lamp next to the bed. The sound is amazing!!! The bass is also incredible! Best part is at night I don’t like the radio too loud and the Echo Show 8 has the perfect low sound too. The camera shut off feature is key. The dimming feature works great so the light doesn’t bother you while sleeping. I highly recommend the Echo Show 8 and don’t be afraid that it’s too much for a bedroom.

I can confirm the speaker and sound from Echo Show 8 is better in absolutely every way compared to first gen. This is obviously expected as Amazon has upped their game in audio. I have the second gen Echo Show in our kitchen and love these two Echo Shows. I think back to 2014 when I first got my hands on the original Echo. This whole ecosystem has evolved so well for the most part (they do have some duds in the line-up). If you’re considering the Echo Show 5 versus the 8, I would recommend the 8. It’s not going to take up nearly as much room as the Echo Show, and the difference in sound quality and extra few inches of screen versus the 5 is obvious. It’s a good in-between option and I’m thrilled Amazon launched this version.

Went into settings and turned off all of the options for notifications which seemed to minimize the ""try alexa"" messages on the display.

","December 26, 2019",Yes,"It's goofy you have to install an app on your phone to set-up and control an Echo, since it's already an Internet connected device. If you have personal security concerns, this device is NOT for you. While you CAN add contacts without allowing the Alexa app on your phone to have access to your phone's contact list, you are still adding an app without knowing exactly what info it is gathering and forwarding. My Echo was a gift to me, but honestly, the video phone feature, which is nice, could just as easily be satisfied by Skype, on a more portable platform like a laptop. If you want this device, and personal security, buy it, install the Alexa app on your phone, enter your contacts, then uninstall the app. You CANNOT add a contact directly via the Echo device, since contacts apparently are not stored locally - so be aware you are giving that info to Amazon to ""manage' for you. Also understand you are giving Amazon permissin to retain everything you do via the Echo, including recording your audio.After mucking with settings I was able to eliminate (turn off) the constant (and very annoying) scrolling through displays of trending topics, weather reports etc. I'd find that distracting and annoying if it was constantly in my field of vision. What you CAN'T turn-off is the never-ending scrolling of prompts at the bottom of the screen demanding you ""Try 'Alexa, do something or other'. Either cover it with a piece of tape, or turn the device so it's face-down.All that said, it works fine, if you don't mind having your calls recorded, your phone compromised, and essentially allowing a sophisticated eaves-dropping device in your home. Remember, the ""S"" in ""IOT"" stands for security.",0

I will stop after a time and you have to tell alexa to resume. Although I can't be sure, it seems to be at the end of the playlist.

","December 19, 2019",Yes,"I love my Show 5. I assumed that the new Show 8 would be an improvement. Instead it is a major step backwards. And the most disappointing part is that Amazon purposely did this and has thus far refused to rectify the very simple problems it installed in the Show 8. You can not use this product for the most basic function that I bought it for, a clock. It does not allow you to put a clock across the main screen. It does not give you the option to put the date anywhere on the face. And it will not allow you to erase the ""Alexa Try"" scroll at the bottom of the screen. Amazon's position is  that the ""Alexa Try"" features are not ads, but that is a moot argument because it is just as annoying as ads. I don't care if it is scrolling Shakespeare at the bottom of the screen, I should have the ability to disable it. Yet Amazon has so far not allowed it. And why, after all the multitude of buyers before me (unbeknownst to me before I bought the Show 8), would Amazon not make basic changes to a product that is so disliked by its customers? Amazon can make a simple software update to rectify all of the criticism, but they have refused to do so. The bottom line is that the Echo Show 8 has fewer basic features, is purposely annoying with its scroll, and costs more than the Echo Show 5. Quite honestly, the Echo Show 8 may be a harbinger for Amazon. Will the company react positively to the consumers' input, or will it continue along the Show 8 experiment and blatantly refuse to abandon common sense over its own agenda?",1

","January 6, 2020",Yes,I was excited for the echo show 8 and ordered as soon as it was released. After setting up and using for a few weeks I am overall disappointed as it feels more like a prototype than an 8th versionPros-Good voice recognition-Speakers are great-Works as a good clock-Works with RingCons-Overall choppy. Alexia can’t do a lot of things. Also freezes regularly and I have to unplug and plug back in-I wanted to use as a baby monitor with my foscam. I was only able to set up 2 of my 3 cameras for some reason as the 3rd camera wouldn’t discover. When I view  the camera it stays up for about 5 minutes then the screensaver comes on. It looks like there is no way to keep the display on so its basically useless for me-Doesn’t work smoothly with Nest as they are forcing me to migrate my nest account to google for it to work-Doesn’t integrate too well with Spotify. Very choppy.Overall disappointing!,0

Also, my receiver will not automatically reconnect to the Echo using Bluetooth. I have to forget the connection on the Echo and re-associate it every time. It is a Denon receiver. I would occasionally have that problem with the Echo Plus, (once a month?) but most of the time it reconnected fine.

I cannot figure out how to get it so that two people with shows can see each other ON THE SHOW.

","January 7, 2020",Yes,"We live out beyond the suburbs in the rural hinterland with marginal internet connectivity. So we have chatted it up with the grandkids with Echo dots, thinking there was inadequate bandwidth for video. But Santa brought the Echo Show, so we gave it a go. Way to go! Literally, plug and play (no plug and pray required).  Very nice display with updated settings interfaces for personal configuration so all those negative reviews (mostly User Not as Smart as Smart Device (UNASSD)) appear to have been listened to and responded with this hardware / software release.Nice sound quality both for video chats and streaming audio. Nice shutter control to block the camera lens if paranoid or conspiracy theorist. Nice long (48"" maybe) power cable for flexibility in placement.  Camera appears to be positioned for counter top placement. We started on top of the microwave but the video chat only got the ceiling fan. Cleared a few inches of counter space and the camera angle covers us well.Negatives: can a review be only good things? Well, thinking hard, the two things we ""dislike"" are the plug end of the power cable takes up a bit of room at the outlet but we managed to squeeze it in; and the integrated camera / display / base unit is fixed - so you either need to be standing in the angle of view for the video chats, or tilt the Echo Show forward and place a pencil or ruler under the back edge to adjust the field of view.  It's not a problem when reading or surfing - only for the video chats.Bonus: I did not realize that the Echo Show would know about the Echo Dot we have upstairs. The first time the Grandkids called, the Dot reported ""call from the Bean"" so we knew to run downstairs and take the incoming video chat. Nice integration, nice online help that explains all the things you can try (or not).  Very pleased, even with some of the very bad ""Dad jokes.""",0

It is very glitchy - voice recognition makes mistakes routinely. We have to repeat many times. Once it takes you to what it thinks you said - you have to exit and repeat what you really want. That’s very annoying too. We like to play games on the device but also annoying when it asks every time if you want to sign up for a subscription on basically every game. We have the google comparable version - voice recognition, games, search is much better. They should Save the response from before and not ask again. It is bulky. Shaped like an old cathode ray tube tv. I guess much of it is the speaker/mic. Nice features being able to use as an intercom with other Alexa devices, play music. Connecting devices is ok with the app. Again google was easier and better. Switched to Alexa as we kept getting echo dots thrown in with purchases. I guess they caught us. The ask Alexa notices on the main screen - don’t bother so much. If you switch to do not disturb - it stops the notifications but then you can’t fully use the device.

I am satisfied with the show.  For my screen saver I personalized it with Amazon photos.  Everyone who comes into the kitchen wants t linger if not for the music for the photos.

","December 28, 2019",Yes,"What I like about the Echo Show 8. What I most like is that it has a display. I already had a echo 1st generation and a echo Plus. I put off buying the echo dot due to it’s tiny size screen, so I decided to purchase the Echo Show 8 due it’s screen size and sales price which included a free echo dot. Naturally the Echo Show 8 does everything the other echos does, but it has the advantage of having a screen to see some features you couldn’t see on the other’s such as news videos when listening to your Flash briefings. You also have access t Tubi  (no account required) which is good if you done mine watching long programs on a 8” screen and others channels such as Hulu, NBC, Prime video, and kitchen all of which requires account linking.I also like that you can download pictures from your phone or Amazon cloud account and add them as background photos show.It’s also nice to have the ability to see the other person you call when both have echo devices with videos capabilities, leaving my phone free for other use.Resuming; what I most like of the echo show 8 is that it has a decent size screen which is the only thing that distinguish it from the others echo devices which does not have a screen. Voice recognition is no better then the others echo devices and I find the the sound quality is not better then the sound I got from my Echo plus even if it does have stereo 2.5” speakers on either side.What I most find disturbing of the Echo Show 8 is the Constance, annoying messages which appears at the bottom on the screen and which their isn’t any way to eliminate. Amazon please do a download update within the menu options to turn this feature OFF. It is stressing me out.",0

There is a way to adjust sound for music play but apparently this does not apply to Alexa so understanding her requires concentration and repetition.

I have attached the picture and the marks are even more obvious with naked eye and across multiple edges of the Echo Show 8 device - the only explanation is that it is a used/retuned item.I am very infrequent with my reviews and my first NEGATIVE review, but thought it was my responsibility to my fellow consumer friends and highlight, a possible misuse of shipping of used Amazon products as NEW, which is nothing short of “bad practice”.  Will wait for the replacement to check out how it operates, but for now it is boxed back and ready to be shipped back (retuned to Amazon) while I await my replacement, which is back ordered.",0

","January 5, 2020",Yes,"Overall, a nice device to integrate into our home setup (more than 2-dozen smart devices, in an IoT integrated home).We've had the first generation of Show devices since they came out and I was excited to see the upgrades. Hands down, the sound quality is greatly improved! Nice improvements to the deeper bass sounds, although I could argue to almost to the point that the highs drop out.Mostly, I was disappointed that my app didn't allow me to add this to our home and that the device doesn't allow some of the new features (like stereo pairing) with older devices. This seems lazy to me.I didn't like that I had to enter the passwords of our account into the device multiple times to set it up.Overall, if I don't have to change configurations too many times, I think I'll like this.

My mistake for thinking the 8 and the 5 had similar features, but the Show 8 options seem very lacking for any device with a screen.

Contrary to beliefs, Echo Show 5 and 8 are capable of showing YouTube videos via the Firefox Browser.3.  Echo Show 5 and 8 have 2 accessible web browsers.  Google Nest Hub does not have an accessible web browser, which you can use to view websites.4.  If you have Amazon Prime, you can watch Amazon Prime videos.  You can't on Google Nest Hub.

","December 14, 2019",Yes,"The echo Show 8 was purchased to hopefully replace a Fire 8 and/or Fire 10 tablet that was being used in the kitchen for recipe preparation from a web url.  When firefox or silk is invoked and you navigate to the site to review/use a recipe or possibly other viewing, the Show 8 times out the browser and returns to the home screen.  This makes it almost unusable for our desired major use.  If you plan on using a static screen through one of the browsers, you will be disappointed currently.  Hopefully this will be changed soon to allow it to stay within a specifically invoked browser.  Otherwise, we really like the device and welcomed it to our home.

Con's: very limited access to popular apps that stream movies or T.V., difficult to return to movies after pausing (you're better off touching the screen); Doesn't allow you to download apps like a tablet.

Don’t know if they push these devices out for Christmas, or because they were out of stock, and they will worry about the problem later.

","December 7, 2019",Yes,I already have the Echo 5 for the room so I bought the Echo 8 for the living room and kitchen.

2.0,"Not up to par with other devices. Disappointing.
  
","December 28, 2019",Yes,Alexa is by far less usable on this device than any other I have. Alexa regularly performs the wrong activity when given a command. Alexa does not understand the stop command on this device. The device frequently takes on a mind of its own which requires unplugging the device to make it stop. The sound quality is at best sub par. Voices when playing something as simple as the news are bad at any kind of elevated volume. The screen is fine but the much less expensive Dot is a better device.,0

","December 28, 2019",Yes,"I have the show 5 in my bedroom as a super smart alarm clock and this as just another smart device.

","December 17, 2019",Yes,I find that it doesn’t understand me frequently and answers about something completely different. I am hoping it is because of alexas need to learn my voice.

Would love to be more in control of the device than be limited by it.,0

I preordered mine and bestbuy matched the $100 price, I had a coupon and points, and the manager messed up a little (which he caught and said I can have that discount) I ended up paying $70.

I am disappointed that you can not run a separate visual and audio. For instance, run audible and have the fireplace on visually. I would think that would be part of the perks of having the  show.

","January 4, 2020",Yes,Have been using the Echo Show 8 for a couple of months now. I have it in the kitchen and I use it often as a timer when cooking. It has a difficulty recognizing me telling it to stop the timer when it goes off. In addition I have Arlo cameras for which there is direct integration to work with Alexa. However I find it that it takes a very long time to load at times (upwards of 2 minutes) and on occasion it doesn’t load the camera feed at all. Overall I would have to say this is a 3 star device.

What is worse is that the picture on Amazon indicates one is able to have a full size clock. I am not sure what the point is of having a larger screen but a smaller clock. Amazon will hopefully offer a download for a variety of clock faces for the Echo Eight. Until they do I encourage you to buy the Echo Five if clock size is of importance,0

","December 30, 2019",Yes,I have been using the unit for about a month now and it works as expected.  Set up was very simple and picked up all of my existing devices.  I like the feature of seeing my Ring doorbells.  I use this as a bedside clock and so much more.  Very happy with the purchase.,0

","December 31, 2019",Yes,"This product is exactly what it is advertised to do. The speaker sounds nice, and the screen is helpful to have. It scrolls through top news and sports news based on your preferences. It works well in our kitchen and is connected to our Ring doorbells.",0

","December 3, 2019",Yes,So once I figured out that I had two amazon accounts and I was signed into a different one on my Alexa app then I was signing into with this it was super easy! My boyfriend is obsessed with this thing! 100% worth the money if you love to cook!,0

","December 17, 2019",Yes,I really liked this device. Only reason I didn't give a 5 star is because I wish I would put a timer for the background pictures.

","January 5, 2020",Yes,Excellent product for the price. Connected right away with my other echo devices. Supper easy to set up. The only thing that would make this product better is if it came with a stand that you would be able to adjust the vision of what all you can see.,0

In order to continually display the clock, you need to set up the Do Not Disturb, which will show the clock and turn off the Things to Try.  When playing prime video's, the picture is clear and the sound is good.  Overall, if I had purchased the Echo 8 first instead of the Echo 5, the shortcomings wouldn't have been as obvious.  In all honesty, I prefer the Echo 5, even though it doesn't show video, which is something I usually do on an IPad or TV.",0

","December 27, 2019",Yes,I cannot get it to do tasks that my older Echo Show did flawlessly. I had a routine set up in my old Show that read the weather in the morning. This won't respond to the weather portion for some reason. It does work though mostly.,0

","December 24, 2019",Yes,"I'm surprised how much larger the Show 8 is compared to the Show 5. That 3 inches gives you, of course, a much bigger screen but it also increases the size of the enclosure and enriches the sound as well. Happy with this purchase!",0

What if all the previous cameras you’ve purchased are battery operated &amp; not hard wired (which is convenient to move around for strategic reasons)???

1.0,"I find the ""SHOW"" products to be sub standard
  
","December 3, 2019",No,"First off, the clock display is soooo small for an 8"" device. Why no full screen? Who designs these things? Then you have the constant onscreen rotation of time-weather-Alexa suggestions-time-weather-suggeations-time. Why even do his Amazon? Allow users the option to select ""full screen clock display"" only. But the real issue is with the overall quality. The sound on these new 8"" units is poor and not clear crisp audio. Sounds like a cheap bluetooth speaker. And the display itself is sub standard and unacceptable. I noticed in a dark room with no background set other than displaying of the clock, there was light bleeding across the screen. Instead of a black screen with the white clock display, you see the entire screen displaying a ""glow"" across the entire screen. Like a TV where the TV is on but no inout is selected, so the screen has a ""faint white glow"" across the screen. I just could not tolerate the poor screen quality, the inability to have a full-screen clock display, and this weird and annoying ""rotation"" feature thing that Amazon insists on designing into their ""Show"" products. And I was very unhappy with the sound quality and the lacking of clarity. Sorry Amazon, but add more user control features into the 'SHOW"" products, and better overall display/sound quality even if you need to raise the price.",6
1.0,"Not as good as the echos show 5
  
","December 9, 2019",No,"Great concept but missed the mark, I purchased the echo show 5 and It's a great little smart device the only real complaint I had was I wished it was a little bigger, fortunately they had a sell on the show 8 and I thought that would be perfect but to my the surprise the ui was different which is misleading because many user like me thought it was a show 5 just bigger boy was I wrong the clock customization isn't the same and on mine the voice recognition is superior on the show 5 hopefully theres an update before I return it",6
3.0,"Doesn't support Netflix, very limited apps
  
","November 30, 2019",No,"Great for seeing the Prime videos you've purchased and can no longer see on your DVD player for whatever stupid reason Amazon and Sony have for no longer supporting each other. However, what would make this alternative perfect, is if it supported Netflix also. But it doesn't. Because heaven forbid you actually have both services on one device.(After I left this review, Amazon Customer Service contacted me and said if you want Apple TV, Netflix and Amazon Prime on one device, you need to get a FIRESTICK or FIRECUBE. Wish I had known that sooner.)Also, this can only run if it's plugged in. When I tried to unplug it to take it to a different room, it died. So, that's a real PITA. It's not as portable as they make it seem. And I don't like the idea of a cord dangling over my sink, so I can follow recipes.If you're going to buy this, get the bundle (the stand is awesome, and you essentially get the plug free) on Black Friday. That's when things cost what they should have always cost to start with.THESE ARE THE ONLY APPS IT PROVIDES: Amazon Prime Video, Tubi, Food Network Kitchen, Hulu, NBC. And so far, the NBC/Spectrum choice doesn't work. So all the apps you see in the description? NOT ACTUALLY AVAILABLE.Also, Alexa doesn't understand simple commands like ""open my video library,"" which is annoying, and for hours, it said that Amazon Music isn't available, but all of a sudden, it became available about six hours later. Not sure what that was about.Really needs update re: software apps, and an updated Alexa interface. I can live with the plug, but this Alexa interface isn't even programmed with the words used on the device.  Screen and sound are good, so that's a plus, but come on. Alexa should be programmed with the words used on the device, like ""access my video library"" or ""open Prime and access my video library.""Hopefully, the Alexa interface will become smarter with use. I went and ordered the fire stick as well, since my DVD player no longer supports Amazon Prime.What would be nice is a longer cord. The cord is only about 4 feet long, so it's too prone to having an accident by someone tripping over the cord.",1
3.0,"Can't do it again due to ""Try"" suggestions and unwanted Ads
  
","December 1, 2019",No,"I think my Echo Show might be one model older than this.  I'd really like to have more for certain purposes but I cannot get past the annoying messages at the bottom of the screen and the unwanted ads, neither of which can be turned off.  I originally got it because I wanted it for a slideshow of a family wedding.  I found out if there are several people in your house and you have the camera ON it will show a continuous slide show of the photos you've chosen AND you'll get an Alexa ""Try"" message at the bottom of the screen for every one.  Also unwanted ads will pop up about suggested recipes, cars for sale in the area, etc.  I originally thought the slide show feature didn't work because I used settings to turn the camera OFF, for privacy concerns.  Well, if I do that then the slide show stops because I guess the camera needs to sense people or movement in the room in order to show continuous photos and annoying adds.  I'd like another one but I can't do it until this ad problem and camera ON/OFF problem that affects the slide show are somehow fixed with a firmware update or something.  When you have a great family photo displayed on the screen and everyone is looking closer to read ""Try ""Alexa tell me a horse joke"""" that's really annoying.  It has great sound if you use it play music, but that's not the primary reason I purchased this.",1

5.0,"Like it more than I thought I would!
  
","December 17, 2019",No,"Got this on Black Friday (not here but at a big box, was there for something else and the salesman talked us into it.) I was worried about whether or not we would be able to use this to it's potential. While we are still working on all that it does, it's nice to have a central hub (if you will) in our home. We started with this, and had 2 echo dots that we got as well at the same time. Set this all up, and as I set up the others it found them right away. We also got a bulb and it found that right away too. We've since added 2 more dots and more bulbs and a smart plug. Between this and using the app I do like how everything integrates together. My only problem is that sometimes Alexa won't hear her name being called. I think my husband talks too fast for her though haha. Also if the kids are fussing or playing in the background she won't always hear her name then. Just get a little closer to her and it works fine. We also have it set up where we used to set up the tablet for the kids' youtube nursery rhymes to play for background noise. Now we can use the tablet for ourselves again and still have their songs going. The speaker is great, we don't even have it hooked up to our whole-house system and it's been fine. Overall it's a good buy. I don't mind the ""Try"" suggestions at the bottom. I thought I would but I don't even notice anymore. If that's your only complaint about this device, you have far less in life to worry about than most people and if that's your only reason to send it back, so be it but it's not bothering me. I'm too busy feeding and entertaining 2 small kids to be worried about something so trivial.",0

","December 29, 2019",No,"I received the Show 8 for Christmas and I put it in my bedroom to replace one of the ten dots we have gotten from various deals from Amazon over the last few months.  I am going it 2 stars because I am still trying to figure out how it is $60 better than a Dot.  It basically is a $80 alarm clock and since I am retired I don’t even need an alarm clock!  I do use it to check on my evil Ring devices on my front and garage doors, not much action there but I’m trying to make this $80 useful.  Truthfully I think this thing is a foolish wate of money.  It will soon go into the closet with many of my other electronic purchases trying to make my world better but failing.  The best electronic thing that I have bought so far is an iRobot i7 vacuum, it works, it’s easy, and I love it.  Save your money and get a vacuum, you will thank me in just a few days.",0
5.0,"The Echo Show can change both the life of someone you love and yours, forever.
  
","December 15, 2019",No,"I’m writing this review for the Echo Show 8 because I believe it is the best value but I have several Echo Shows of varying sizes.  About a year ago I gave my 94-year-old mother an Echo Show.  My dad has passed and she now lives alone in Florida. I live alone in Connecticut.  For the most part, I set it so that she and I could ‘drop-in’ on each other.  Doing this has changed both our lives.My mother is not a technology person. She has WiFi internet access through her cable company and owns both a computer and a Netbook. She uses them to play cards, check her email and read.  She does carry a non-smart phone with her when she is out and about but doesn’t use it for regular calls.  Her tech support is me.  For the most part, my tech support has been to say “Mother, go where the cable company’s box is, unplug it, count to 10 and plug it back in”.  I’ve abandoned long ago trying to escalate support to the “Mother, sit down at the computer….“ level.  So far that has been successful for both the Internet and the Echo.  Now, I configured the Echo at home and shipped it to her in a ‘just plug it in” state.  It worked but I only mention this to say it can be done if necessary but I will also say it was not easy – especially for someone like her that has not Internet identity.  I’d suggest you visit your mom to set it up in her home – you don’t visit her enough as it is.One essential tool you will need is an Amazon Fire tablet.  The Fire will be your tech support console and I can’t stress enough how important that is going to be.  You attach it to her Amazon Echo account so you can remotely change settings, add elderly user Skills (there are many) and listen to what she is saying to the Echo - both essential and at times, humorous. Let me add a note on privacy – there is none.  Yet you will still want to set the “Drop-In” command to automatically connect (trust me on this).  It would seem obvious to add this caution but be sure to place the Echo in a public place and wear clothes when nearby.I love my mother but she is Echo challenged. It’s not that she doesn’t use it for other purposes and she has. The only command she really uses is “Drop in on Al”.  Once mastered, she will introduce you to her friends and neighbors.  She will have lunch with you.  She will sit in her chair and talk about your father, your growing up, her growing up.  She will hear you talk about how your day went, your work, your plans for the future. She will silently listen to your rant on politics and seem interested.  Essentially, she will be your mother.This is different from when you visit in person. She won't be worrying about getting new sheets on the bed, trying to think of something to entertain you while you are there.  I tell people that with the Echo you can imagine yourself in her kitchen, talking to her while she is washing dishes.  You will keep the channel open for hours at a time.  This is not Facetime; you can do things. You can cook, make lunch, do the dishes, pay your bill but more importantly – talk. In the morning she will chastise you with “Look who’s getting up so late” in that tone she used when you were 16.  She will ask what you are having for breakfast.  She will be there in the evening to talk about your day.  She once told me that she knows more about me now than at any time before I left for college.  She will tear you up when she says “if your dad had known all of this, he would be so proud of you.”A true judge of the importance of the Echo came when she moved to Virginia to be near my brother.  Before the furniture arrived, before anything, she plugged in the Echo to talk about the move.It is a commitment.  It will be part of her life, and yours, forever.  But it will be a comfort to her and an assurance to you that she is ok.",0

","January 10, 2020",Yes,"I love the fact that I purchased and installed switches for lights, fans, stereo and other things in my home.  Having challenges and being able to ask ALEXA to turn them on or off is great.  I have Ring as well as WYZE  cameras all around my property, indoors and out.  As a senior, I sometimes leave lights on in other rooms, in the garage and in my Arizona room..  I can ask ALEXA to show me the room and if a light or stereo equipment is on in that room, I can turn products on or off from my bed or my easy chair.  I have 4 Echo Shows and several echo dots. and several wall plates and switches that operate with ALEXA I love being able to play music everywhere on all of them.What I don't like is that it is, sometimes hard for me to communicate with ALEXA , I guess that she doesn't understand diversity, ebonics, or my southern drawl.  It seem that she doesn't always, wait for me to finish, my request before she is answering and it is usually not the response that I wanted.  Since I have to use ALEXA to wake her up I would like her to be able to call my name in her responses, sometimes she does and other times she doesn't.  I have no idea when or why she does that, what the heck did I say to trigger her calling my name. but I love it when she does.  I started with the echo show 5 and loved it, but at night I had to try to find my eyeglasses to see what was on the screen in my bedroom.  Since then there was a sale on the echo show 8 and I purchased 2, and i don't need to struggle with my eyeglasses to see her.  I'm in love.  The echo show 8 does a lot more that the 5's and have a better sound quality to it.One other thing is that I am a child from the Harry Truman Administration, I had no idea that all of these devices take up a lot of Wi-Fi, I had  to increase my Wi-Fi, or whatever to the tune of an additional $30. a month.",0

","December 7, 2019",No,"Updated... Update 2Pros:* The Audio is loud and works well with this device* The Screen is a good size, looks fine and is viewable a couple feet away without issueCons:* The User experience relies heavily on a phone app and voice commands. While there are ways of accessing menus manually, it still feels a bit clunky and I wish there was a way to switch to a quieter tablet style mode.* UI in general is clunky, don't expect a tablet experience at all.* Some voice commands don't work properly, sleep timers in some video apps won't work (major problem if you're data capped)* Doesn't provide useful information when something goes wrong. No error code, just a ""Sorry, something went wrong""** Hulu managed to break again, disabling/re-renabling doesn't fix it. Can only watch ""Keep watching"" content. Not happy about this since Hulu was the only selling point for us.General Thoughts: Hardware wise, this is a great price. Software wise, I hope Alexa get's smarter and they improve the user experience. If you're using an older phone, triple-check that you can use the Alexa App because it may be necessary.",1
