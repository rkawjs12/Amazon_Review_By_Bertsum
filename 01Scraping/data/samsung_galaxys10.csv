2.0,"Good, but with some flaws
  
","May 3, 2019",Yes,"Phone new and sealed as advertised. Received in my hotel during my stay in Orlando, FL. Used with a local US carrier and also here in Brazil (where I live), without any problems. Amazing phone.BUT, some things have to be pointed out:1. The phone came from Singapore (as can be seen from some pre-installed apps).2. So, Samsung Pay (and Samsung Rewards) does not work with non-Singapore local credit cards. Although it could have been clarified in the advertisement by the seller, the problem is related to a Samsung policy, which I clarified directly with Samsung Technical Support in Brazil. The country in Samsung Pay cannot be changed (even if reinstalled locally). I even managed to register my international credit card issued in Brazil, but Samsung Rewards points will be lost because it could only be used in Samsung's Singapore partners. As I use Samsung Pay a lot, this is very disappointing.3. Came with a (somewhat large) Type G charger (standard for UK, Singapore, Hong Kong) and an adapter for US standard.4. Did not receive the 128Gb micro SD card.Iâ€™d be glad if seller could help with any of these items, or share other related experiences.",221

5.0,"Bought for Dual SIM: Got a Great Overall Phone
  
","August 3, 2019",Yes,"I did about a month of research prior to purchasing this phone. Comparing online the Samsung S8/S9/S10 and other brands from China. Seeing that I have owned Samsung from the S3 I am partial to the brand as it has always done well for me. I needed a phone in the US to function with two SIM cards simultaneously, one for work one for home, without having two completely different cell phones. I should also say, that I was not interested in an Apple Device.  The carrier that both of my SIM cards uses is ATT. At the time of purchase, ATT does not carry a Samsung device in the US that offers a dual SIM capability.In the Box (factory sealed with intact seal):- Galaxy S10 (SM-G973F)- AKG wired headphones w/mic- US wall plug w/USB C cord (charger)- Pre-installed screen protector (brand unknown as it was already on the phone)- Clear plastic case (brand unknown, and offers minimal protection)- 128GB SD Card (not able to use internal to the phone due to my need for 2 seperate SIM cards)- USB C Male to standard USB female adapter (use for data transfer and/or keyboard/mouse capabilities)- Informational material specific to the phone- Internal SIM card holder with dual functionality (Can hold 2 micro SIM Cards or 1 micro SIM and one SD Card)Initial power on and setup:- Battery was 50% +/- charged- Initial power up was in another language, however a drop down menu on the initial screen offered English (Canada). This option was selected and found to be what as needed for proceeding with US setup- Effortless data transfer from Samsung S8 to S10 using Samsung Smart Switch.- The ATT SIM card was plug and play, no additional setup was needed other than inserting the SIM into the phone.Initial impressions/functions of S10:- Dual SIM capability (yes, both are physical SIM cards (no eSIM)- Wireless charging (Yes)- Headphone jack (Yes)- 3 main rear cameras and 1 front camera (all function very well)- Hidden fingerprint scanner (works well)- Facial recognition (works really well, I no longer need to use my fingerprint unless I am in very low light conditions)- Bixby, (another ""helper"" akin to Alexa, Google, etc. I was never really a fan of my phone talking to me, so this will probably be more of a toy than a feature for me personally. However, there is a dedicated button on the left hand side for Bixby. This button can be customized with a tap or double tap for an additional quick launch of an app. I chose a single tap for my camera.- Other interesting, helpful, gimmicky, etc function on the phone. Some are great and add well to the phone. Others, I simply disabled or hid.Dual SIM: The real reason I purchased the phone.- I will start by saying that this international version of the S10 was EXACTLY what I was hoping for in a cell phone.- Two separate physical ATT SIM cards are being used.- On the phone screen I am able to see signal strength for both SIM cards- I am able to set a default SIM card for: 1) Phone Calls, 2) Text, 3) Data. This is done easily with a swipe down from the top of the screen and shown directly below the primary settings (such as WiFi, GPS, BlueTooth, etc.)- However, default does not mean that the ""secondary"" SIM is in standby.- When making calls, I am given the option of easily calling from SIM 1 or SIM 2 (which can also be identified with different symbols rather than numbers, such as a home symbol and work symbol).- When texting, I am given the option of easily sending from SIM 1 or SIM 2, same things with the symbols.- When using data, the phone uses the default setting that was chosen by the user.- The phone is able to receive calls for both phone numbers without having to change settings.- All in all, I am very impressed with the intuitiveness of the design, capability, and ease of use with the dual SIM functionality.Overall Impression:With everything from purchase cost, minimal wait time for delivery, setup, use, and functionality I am very impressed. At this time, there is not a single thing about the phone where I would say ""this could be better"". I will say that I am not a gamer, thus the phone will not be used for them. I cannot comment on how well it would be used for games. I do take many pictures than range from people to panoramic vista views of National Parks and the phone is used as my main daily use camera. Samsung has never let me down in this area. Very happy with this purchase.",8
2.0,"Galaxy s10 underpowered for some smartphone users.
  
","May 14, 2019",Yes,"If you use a smart phone as it should be, the battery in the Galaxy s10 is pitiful.  In three weeks time, there was not a day where the battery didn't need recharging.  I turned it in for the s10+ and have had no problems with the battery, though it is not quite as robust as Samsung claims.  Of course I run dual sim and wifi all day, but I think phone makers should expect that these days.  In fairness, Samsung announced it had a smaller battery than the s9+, which I had previously, so I should have read between the lines.",11

","May 7, 2019",Yes,"The phone is great. There is lot to love about s10. Super fast. In-display ultrasonic fingerprint is not fast as optical fingerprint sensors but it will get better by time as it is a new technology. One thing i am not satisfied with is selfie camera performance on low light. There is no major improvement whatsoever over its previous generations. I usually do not take many selfies; so it is not a big issue for me but if you do, consider this. Other than that i have not had any problems. It works pretty well. Sound is amazing. Screen is amazing. Customization is everything",11

The only differences between the international version and the one bought at U.S. dealers are that this one runs on Exynos instead of Snapdragon, and that my phone seems to have come from Thailand since I see software pre-installed (Samsung Pay) that has text in Thai.

It took me 3 days, to finally get it to pair with my home WIFI. After it finally paired in with that, it updated it's programs. I do not care for it's ""Bixby"" button, being connected Right Next to the volume buttons. When I go and turn the volume up, it suddenly pops up a Warning ""That could be hazardous to your hearing""... I didn't buy a phone to mange ME and my habits!!!

5.0,"S8 to S10 upgrade review
  
","September 23, 2019",Yes,"I broke my S8 a couple weeks ago, which was very disappointing because I loved that phone and was expecting to use it for another two years at least. The S10, however, is essentially the S8 but better. The OS is snappier and more responsive, which I never knew I wanted from the S8. The finger print scanner is on the front now, which I have mixed feelings on and think I preferred the rear scanner. The Samsung *swipe up to get mad* wallet feature is gone, which is nice. Android Auto is actually significantly better, with improved performance and a redesigned interface.And that's pretty much all I have noticed that is different from the two models. I can't confidently say that this phone is a 700$ upgrade from the S8 when half of the improvements are simply removing Samsung bloat that shouldn't have been there in the first place. But for someone coming from an iPhone or buying a phone from scratch, this is a great choice. I'm giving this 5 stars because the S8 was a near perfect phone for me (save for the bloat), and the S10 sticks closely to the same formula.",1

After repeated checks with my service provider it was confirmed that the problem was with the phone and not the service. This was verified through various forums and chats by other persons in different countries with the S10 who had the same problem. Whenever I leave an area with wifi, I have to go to the sim card manager and change from 4g to 3g then back to 4g to get mobile data. As soon as I get a call I lose mobile data and have to go 3g then 4g again to get it back. Same thing if the signal gets weak or I go in and out of a wifi area. Huge risk if attempted while driving. I have reset the phone, reseated the sim card and tried other recommended fixes to no avail. No warranty so buyer beware. Very disappointed.",3

I use family mobile at Walmart and it works well with the phone. I only see minor glitches like the screen will be slow sometimes and I think it is because I switch browsers a lot. I think that glitches are normal though because I use a new iPhone X at work and the apps crash all the time. Overall super happy with my new phone. I wish the charger was more effective though.

I love love love it. My only two cons are the battery life draining a little quicker than I like for a new phone (I feel like Androids in general are just like this) and the fingerprint scanner and face recognition being a tad slow (it's my first time having a phone with biometrics, and its slow to me).

It also came with a 128GB SD card as a surprise gift which is also nice.  Now for the $750 right now it's a total steal.,4

","June 12, 2019",Yes,"Box arrived open. Looks like a refurbish. All the components were without the factory film. The device was with the films, but in some places there was an attempt to take them out. I thought I was buying a factory sealed product and it was not. I think I'll stay, but I should be given a good discount. Amazon should take this seriously, since I've been a buyer for some time. Thank you.",3
5.0,"Battery life is simply Amazing. Get it, you won't regret it.
  
","August 14, 2019",Yes,"If you are wearing sunglasses then it gets annoying but when you are not then it works great. I drive 12 hours a day and during day time in summer, I'm almost always wearing sunglasses until sunset. So until then my face recognition doesn't work. And I don't like fingerprint unlock as it means I have to tap on my phone screen and put my finger in exact position on the scanner, which I'm very bad at doing so while I'm driving a semi.On the other hand, battery life is amazing on this phone. Far better than my old phone s7edge which hardly lasted half day of minor use. This one on the other hand leaves me with 30% after all day of use on single charge. Not a big social media using guy. If you are driving around then the battery is used up a lot more than when I'm home. Camera is very neat and night mode and all the slow mo and 4K stuff is pretty cool.Display is absolutely gorgeous as you would expect from a Samsung device. In fact, I had to turn off the 4k resolution and use only HD version or something to quiet it down a little bit. As my eyes are still used to s7 display. Over all, I love this phone and Samsung as always been my number one choice for Android phones for a good reason.",0

I highly recommend, great purchase for a great value!",1

","July 9, 2019",Yes,Setup was very simple.  I've been using the phone for about two weeks and it is a vast improvement from my iPhone 6.  I don't like Bixby...it interferes with photographing and I find that very frustrating but all and all...I like the Samsung 10S.,2
