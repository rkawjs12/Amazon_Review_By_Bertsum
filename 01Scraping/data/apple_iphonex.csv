","January 2, 2019",Yes,"This review is for the phone, but considering how it was bought from this Amazon seller.I was a bit weary to buy, given the varying reviews. It arrived in a white, unmarked box as expected as a renewed/refurbished product. Came with an offbrand charger, but no headphones.The description said, by definition, it would have minimal to no scratches. There is one 3/8” to 1/2” scratch near the front camera on the screen that goes into the functional screen area. It’s not terrible, but I would consider it a little more severe than minimal.Battery health was said to be about 80% if I remember correctly. Battery health as received was 96%, which I was happy about.Everything else, a few days in, seem to be on par with a new phone. I will update this review with any shortfalls or unanticipted failures going forward.",329

","February 5, 2019",Yes,"My iPhone X was delivered in what I believe to be near perfect condition. Very light scratch on the face of the screen, however it disappeared after installing a tempered glass screen protector. Powered on just fine and is fully compatible with my at&amp;t SIM card. The iPhone came with 89% of it’s original factory battery health which is more than advertised for this refurbished product (battery health can be found in settings). With the iPhone X I also received both an apple brand power cable and wall adapter (I got lucky). My apple AirPods and apple watch (both sold separately) paired to this devise without any issues.Overall: I received my product exactly as advertised which makes me very satisfied. Other reviewers complain about things outside of the sellers control such as the lack of a headphone jack and the new gesture controls used in place of the retired “home button”. The learning curve felt easy and natural. Potential buyers should look into the features of the phone before buying this product new OR refurbished. 5/5 stars highly recommended.",90

","January 10, 2019",Yes,"This is a refurbished iPhone X. The box is from Verizon company that comes with only the charger and the phone. Doesn’t have a pin to eject the SIM card nor earphones. The screen is a bit scratched but that’s to be expected since it’s refurbished. The box also said that it’s a pre owned. So the assumption is that someone turned in the phone for an upgrade. The battery health is at 99%. Today is the first day I’m using it so don’t really know how long the battery will last me. I ordered a screen protector so maybe that’ll blocker the scratch a bit. We shall see. Overall, it’s a cheap iPhone X with 256 GB. I have T-Mobile and the SIM card works. Not a bad deal at all.",73

","November 7, 2019",Yes,"So before I made this purchase, I read through a lot of reviews on a lot of different sellers who had iPhone X's for sale. This one seemed to have the most consistent positive stream of reviews, although every single listing I came across had at least a few people reporting bad experiences. Buying something Amazon Renewed seems like it's always a risk, so I suppose you may have a bad experience, but the phone I received came on time, and was essentially in flawless condition. It came with a tempered glass screen protector already on, and the battery health was at 92%, supporting peak performance capabilities. The cameras are crisp, no damage to them at all, and the speakers sound great. No SIM/WiFi/Bluetooth connectivity issues whatsoever, and really I was pleasantly surprised at how great this phone is. The only thing was that in a couple of the crevices on the phone, chiefly around the camera's protrusion, there was a tiny bit of dirt/grime, but a toothpick and alcohol did the trick. Overall I would say this is a great purchase, as iPhone X's are currently going for $899+tax (new) from Best Buy, and this was almost new for $559+tax (~$611). Would recommend!",35

The first thing I checked was the battery health and it was 100%! Everything functions perfectly. Love the Face ID. Great camera and sound. Once you get used to no home button, you won’t miss it. Without it the screen fills the whole phone. So the overall phone size is not too big, but you get more screen size - a win win in my opinion. So far I am presently satisfied.",19

After 5 months of gentle use (never dropped, expensive protective case, never wet, etc.) it completely died on the charger overnight. When I contacted Trademore, they said after 90 days, there's nothing they can do. They made no offer to troubleshoot. We've taken it to a repair shop and found out the processor had gone bad. We're spending almost as much as a brand new phone now, which I wish I'd done in the first place (which would have given us the Apple guarantee).",8

","July 25, 2019",Yes,"The phone arrived right on time and in great condition. The charger that was included worked great.However, I think this phone must be from Korea or Japan, where it's apparently illegal to take digital photos without an audible shutter click. There is absolutely no way to turn off the sound, even when the phone is muted and the volume is turned all the way down. It happens in every major application that uses the camera.As an art student, I take TONS of pictures, and the camera is the primary reason why I got the iPhone X. I took it to multiple IT stores where they told me to either return the phone or to jailbreak it to rewrite the lines of code that affect the feature (and jailbreaking voids any warranty or service that Apple offers). I'm returning it because it's too big of a hiccup to work around (can't take pictures in a wedding/library/quiet setting at all...!).Ideally, they should make sure that the country of origin is taken into consideration before selling someone a product if it's going to be such a major feature difference.TLDR: nice phone, in great condition, good price, came on time, but this particular phone is unusable for anyone who likes to take pictures",7

","September 19, 2019",Yes,"This item is claimed to be a ""functioning like new"" device, but this is NOT TRUE AT ALL. Let me walk through this dramatic tragedy in detail.I had been monitoring the package from the moment after purchase, so it wasn't an accident that on that bright, sunny day I was waiting by the mailbox as the delivery truck cruised in. Grabbing my package, I ran inside, ecstatic at the prospect of my newest gadget. Gazing at that chrome-plated beauty, I knew love at first sight was true.As I set up this electronic treasure, I tap into ""settings"" to feast my eyes on the sight you rarely see in an iPhone... the battery at full capacity reader proudly gleaming a 100% like-new condition. But no, what sight met my eyes gave me a horror as you would not believe. Eighty....... Three...... Percent...... Now my mind was racing. I had already vowed til death do us part, but now looking at my bride's screen I realized what I had to do. I needed a second doctors opinion. I scheduled an appointment as soon as we returned from the honeymoon with Apple Memorial Hospital, and settled in to an uneasy vacation with my new love.... it was then that tragedy struck.As I started editing a slow motion video of a man breaking an egg on his forehead, the screen flickered and died. I gently tried to shake her awake, hitting the power and volume button up and down (Mainly down. A volume button being obviously a huge plus on a wife) As I rushed her to the ER at the nearest Apple Memorial Hospital I feared the worst. And the worst is what I got. Her heart, (known as a smart board) had failed. She would never speak to me again. I never saw her eyes open since that day, and I'll never forget the last image I saw of her, as the egg was making it's final impact on that man's head.I don't tell this story for self pity. I realize that this may be emotional for many of you to recall similar moments in your life's past. Perhaps even recent past. I share this only from a place of love and concern for other members of this community in the Amazon, that you don't make the same mistakes as I did. I will add one last word and say I have found support groups especially helpful during this emotional time. Thank you all for your time, and I hope you never buy.. *ahem, marry*  a bride from this father-in-law.Happy phone hunting!",4

Battery health is at 84% (I wish it was over 95%) but it works much better than my old iPhone and I'll replace the battery in time if it does not hold charge.

I had to hang up on the press because I held the power button then my phone started working again. Weird.

I tried to submit a warranty request for their 90 day warranty but they wanted me to return the phone and be without one for more than a week and go through another 10hrs of wiping data and reloading data/signing in and setting up apps. I was also out of the country and couldn’t do that. Anyway they still get one extra star for providing decent service and having an ok product. After I fix these things though could have just bought a new one. So think about that first. You might get lucky. You might notMy initial review (3 stars): Generally this phone is in pretty good shape.  Battery life is at 89%, the case is nice, and the photo lens is clear.

I got it restarted about 30 minutes later, and then it immediately overheated again and completely died. My refurbished iPhone lasted exactly 130 days.I, of course, contacted the seller but they refused to help me or stand behind what they sold me. They basically said “too bad, so sad” the warranty is 90 days.

I got it about a month after it hit stores. I don’t miss the headphone jack because I only use it with Bluetooth devices. For reference, I use Bose soundlink 360 II, Bose Mini, PowerBeats 3 and Bose QuietComfort 35 II. They all connect great without a hitch. Some persons must have gotten a lemon.

So, you may want to look for that when ordering. I now have a MintMobile sim in the phone and it works on T-Mobile towers. I’ve had no issues so far and was happy for the price I paid $584.

1.0,"Great phone that stopped working!
  
","June 10, 2019",Yes,"I recently decided to upgrade from the iPhone 7 to the iPhone X.I was unimpressed with any enhanced features, and namely the new face recognition to unlock the device. After the first two days of owning the new iPhone, I was over it. Gone was the ease of simply using a finger print to unlock the phone. This became annoying since I have to have a passcode on the phone and many apps I use day to day require either a pin or passcode which would generally use the finger id. Yes, the face recognition would unlock the device, but I had to literally pickup the phone every time I wanted to access email, text messages, or review information in an app. Previously, my phone could rest on my desk, I simply use my finger id to unlock and easily access whatever. Now, I have to pick up the phone or make it obvious I am accessing something on my phone.Aside from the new facial recognition, there is nothing really feature enhanced from the iPhone 7. Sure, you can argue, better camera etc, but that is minimal and not worth the money or upgrade with something already awesome. The downside was i didn't even own the phone for 3 weeks and the screen stopped working, the phone wouldn't power on... very disappointing.",0

","April 11, 2019",Yes,"So far the phone has been great. It came with a small but noticeable scratch on the back glass, which was expected.I was very disappointed with how it was packaged and protected in the packaging. I’ve bought screen protectors that have come in a more secure package. It came in a box inside a padded envelope. When I opened the envelope my box was destroyed (which I do know isn’t the fault of the seller but of bad shipping and handeling. My point is that it should’ve been protected in the event that the shipping wasn’t careful). It was pure luck that the phone itself wasn’t broken. It just didn’t give me the best feeling. I was disappointed to be honest. I wish it would’ve come in a box similar to the box which iPhones originally come in, being more similar to a case than a cheap paper box.The phone itself is great so far. The wall charger and cord are off brand which was again expected. Everything works well. Other than being sent in a sketchy package overall, I’m happy with the product itself. Better than I expected actually.. and that’s why I’m giving 4 stars.",0

2.0,"iPhone X After Half A Years Use
  
","August 11, 2018",No,"I would first like to say that I have supported apple for a long time but this phone is unreliable and not worth the money. I have held off on writing a review in hopes that this phone would improve but it continues to be crap. My first issue with this phone is it's lack of a headphone jack. Now when I purchased this phone I knew I would have to carry around an adapter and I was willing to accept that; however, I was not prepared for my phone to not play music or connect even when I had said adapter. Furthermore, it used to not continuously charge meaning I would constantly have to re-plug it in and now it refuses to charge all together. Also, it will stop playing songs or Siri will turn on (even after I disabled her) for no reason. In addition, the camera will constantly freeze when I try to zoom in which has often stopped me from taking amazing photos. All in all this phone is glitchy, not worth the money, ugly (I mean did they really think making the top dip down was a good idea?), and will ultimately annoy you to the point where you have to write a rant online and not even on the official website because apple doesn't want to hear people's opinions.",28
4.0,"The Cell Phone Equivalent of a Concept Car, for Better and Worse.
  
","September 1, 2018",No,"The iPhone X is the most exciting phone I've owned since the iPhone 3GS so many years ago. I only recently had an opportunity to get one and it looks amazing, its cameras are spectacular and its quickness can be felt everywhere. Apple knew their design would be exciting, so they skipped over number 9 and made it the ""10,"" as if to say they're showing you a window to the future, just like a concept car. But as we all know, concept cars rarely end up on the assembly line without a few changes, and with good reason. Here's why the iPhone X, for all its power and beauty, really just deserves a ""B"" for its design:1) The phone's signature looks turn anonymous inside a case.2) The phone's surfaces all scratch easily.3) It is the most slippery phone I've ever encountered.Add these things together, and you have a beautiful phone that MUST be put in an obscuring case, which makes its beauty kind of pointless. Inside a case and switched off, it doesn't even have Apple's signature circular button to identify itself. As of right now, I only have glass protectors on the front and back, but I know what will happen if I keep it like this long-term.The other new feature on the iPhone X is Face ID, or ""expensive way to avoid having a button on the front of the phone."" It works fine, but requires mild adjustments in how you use your phone and is definitely no better than Touch ID. I turned off the ""attention detection,"" meaning I don't have to be looking directly at the phone to unlock it, and now it is quick and unobtrusive.Finally, there's the ""notch."" This is a non-issue. I don't know what the fuss is about unless you're a software designer. Moving on.All in all, I've had my iPhone X for a couple months and couldn't be happier. It is not perfect, and I'll bet it'll be completely replaced by Fall 2019 (now that designer Jonny Ive is back in charge), but I'm loving everything about it. Even its flaws.",10
5.0,"Just as good as buying the phone from the actual store
  
","January 1, 2019",No,I got this item super quickly (ordered on Christmas and received that following Friday) and it has been perfect so far. Was very easy to set up the phone to my phone company (Verizon) and has all of the amazing features. Works exactly like a new phone. haven't had any technical difficulties with the phone thus far. Would highly recommend buying this item.,2
5.0,"Really great condition
  
","December 7, 2019",No,"It was as advertised where the phone was like new, so I'm very happy with the decision to go with an Amazon refurbished device.  Battery life shows at 92%, but it doesn't last as long as my iphone 8, but it sounds like that may be normal even when new.Cord and charger were the only disappointment.  They were 3rd party and not working.",0
