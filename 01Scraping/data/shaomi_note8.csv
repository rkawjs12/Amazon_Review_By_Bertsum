1.0,"International is not Global (Not US compatible)
  
","November 24, 2019",Yes,"For someone who is unfamiliar with the terms for foreign produced cell phones, international sounds like it would work internationally. Many of the questions are ""will this work with X network"" and people reply yes, it is an international phone. International phones are not produced to work particularly well in the US, and do not often have the LTE bands necessary to have good service. CHECK THE BANDS NECESSARY WITH YOUR PROVIDER!Also, these often tend to be Chinese versions of the phone with the Global ROM flashed over the original Chinese ROM. This means that you could have issues with updates and such, limiting your use and enjoyment of the phone.This phone may work well for you, however, make sure it works with your network and that you do want the international version instead of the global version.",26
3.0,"Camera sucks - 48mp and 4 camera doesn't mean the pictures will be good
  
","November 20, 2019",Yes,"I was looking for a replacement for a kid's phone,  she have a xiaomi mi a2 to play games, take pics and message her friends. I  thought this would be a good replacement due to the full screen and a 48mp camera to take pics.  But it is not much better,  in a odd way I thought it was worst.  I compared this phone to my Samsung Note 10 and my daughter's Mi a2,  this is what I found.  To no surprise the Note 10 takes much better pictures, is faster and just better in every way.  I am not taking off any stars due to this since the Note 10 is a much better phone.  I am giving this 3 star because it is just a little bit better than the Mi A2.  It is a better looking phone, it feels like a high end phone while in hand than the A2,  it is faster (not by much), more memory, bigger and better screen,  but the most important and the item that made me want to buy this phone in the first place was the camera.  The camera was subpar considering Xiaomi is advertising how good this camera is.Indoor pics - sucks - The A2 took better pics indoorNight mode - sucks - almost useless - note sure if I am comparing this to the Samsung but its uselessMacro - sucks - A2 took better pics and it doesn't even have this option/featureThe camera was such a disappointment that I reset the phone and printed out a return label.  I did not even take this outdoor to test it,  since indoor sucked and might of be half the pics she will take I decided it is not even worth continuing to test it.Good:Faster than the A2, comparable to mid end phonesFull body screenLoud speakers - Keyword is loud, not nice soundingIts very nice to look atPriceWide angle cameraBad:Camera - indoor, night, macro, front/selfie camera all suckedSpeed - lags a little bitI did not feel that it was worth upgrading to this phone from the A2 even when the A2 is already a year or two older.  Thats how bad I thought it is.  Either the A2 is really good or this is really bad.  This phone on paper should be been easily much better.  Like day and night difference.  This is why it gets 3 stars.",19
5.0,"Why bother with overpriced flagship phones?
  
","December 20, 2019",Yes,"First of all, contrary to another review, this phone DOES work in the US. I'm on Mint Mobile and I've had 4g LTE in Upstate NY, Chicago and Seattle. Even backroads where I had no signal with Sprint towers, I've got more now.With that being said, I love this phone. I was using a Galaxy S7 since 2015 and the difference between the two is night and day. Apps load quick, I can fly my drone without worrying and there's a ton of new features here with Android 9 (and soon to be Android 10)My main concern going in was reports of unnecessary bloatware and ads, but after switching to a third party launcher and disabling all the ""recommendations"" in Settings my phone is ad free.Can't recommend enough, and I think I'll be sticking with Redmi phones for a long time. It's a high powered unlocked Android device.",9

Clear casing let's the phone be seen but takes a bit from luster.Slight learning curve in that this is an import from China and requires minor set-up on certain features (sound notification comes to mind) but that's preference-related.
