1.0,"Initially good but suddenly washed out/ defective display
  
","August 23, 2018",Yes,"Initially we were happy with the product especially since we got it a  very good price last Amazon Prime Day sale on July 16, 2018.  We liked how we can watch and stream shows easily thru various apps like Netflix, Amazon video, Dramafever, Rakuten etc. Very lighrweight tv and just right for our needs. However to our surprise just awhile ago August 22, 2018,  while streaming a drama series, the on screen display turned washed out/white screen. Turned on and off the  tv several times to see if it will reboot/restart properly. Unfortunately nothing remedied it. Either you get back to that washed out screen or a totally black screen no apps at all. I have just submitted a replacement request thru Amazon customer service so we will see what happens and how fast they will address our complaint.Just an update, so we ended up being told by Amazon, to contact Best Buy and we did that by email at the same time indicating in the letter we want a replacement. Best Buy replied to us that it is outside of the return period  if we want contact Toshiba directly. So, we did just that..with sheer frustration of course being tossed around. Toshiba nicely told me that they will send the techinician and I asked which company handle this techinician is it Toshiba or a third party. Ironically, they are coordinating with who else. The Geek Squad. Oh dear..back to Best Buy then. The Geek Squad guy came on the appointment date, just a few minutes late, but was nice enough. His assessment as discussed with whoever was on the other end of the line came down to an approval for a replacement. So we were asked to bring the tv over to our local Best Buy, gave us the confirmation and work numbers. Even gave us his business card and that of his manager if in case we encounter problems.  For some reason it seems it is not common for them to service products sold by Best Buy throught the Amazon website.So we went to our local Best Buy. The lady was nice enough, and honest enough to say she was not familiar with an Amazon sale of a Best Buy product.  So I had to tell her again the long story of how we got the tv etc etc. Finally someone helped her encode the return correctly and we had a store credit for the complete amount we paid for. However when we got the replacement tv, the price in store is slightly higher so we had to shoulder now the difference.  Well, we just paid for it. So in short losing the advantage of that Prime deal sale price which did not work at all with a defective product.  We do wish these three companies, Amazon, Best Buy and Toshiba iron out the way they handle requests for replacements and returns....seems initially both Amazon and Best Buy did not want to shoulder the return. If we had not insisted on availing the limited manufacturer's warranty, we would just have been left with a useless crap of a tv.So we are now watching on this 2nd toshiba tv we got in store at  our local Best Buy. Will see if this one will work much better.So beware fellow buyers, was it a good buy now?? Not really after all that ordeal to get a defective product replaced. So buyer beware!!","6,043"
1.0,"Flickering issues 1st day &amp; Amazon wouldn't replace it-Prime Day deal was too good apparently
  
","August 24, 2018",Yes,"We bought this 50 inch TV on Prime Day.  The picture is a screen shot of a video I took and not very good representation.  Upon setting it up the TV had flickering lines and squares in random places on the screen.  This occurred no matter what app was being used.  I contacted Amazon, Best Buy, and Toshiba via phone to attempt to replace the TV with the same model.  Amazon stated that I could only return the TV.  Best Buy stated that they would replace it, but I had to go through Amazon, and Amazon refused to replace it.  I went to Best Buy locally, and they stated that they could not override Amazon's return policy for Prime Day electronics.  I contacted Toshiba to attempt to utilize the warranty, but they stated that since it was new they would not replace it and that I needed to return it to Amazon.  So I had to take it apart (no biggie) and place it back inside of the box.  Luckily I had the box and styrofoam inserts still.  Then I had to lug it to a UPS store to send it back to Amazon for a refund.  I will never buy electronics on Prime Day again.  The great price was the reason that Amazon and Best Buy stated that the TV would not be replaced.  Now I have to wait for either Labor Day sales or Black Friday sales to get a good deal on a TV locally.  Thanks a lot Amazon!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","2,390"
5.0,"5 Stars, great TV
  
","October 14, 2018",Yes,"Firstly, YOU *CAN* CHANGE THE SETTINGS SO THE TV DOES NOT ALWAYS START AT THE HOME SCREEN when it turns on.  I almost did not buy this TV because of all the negative reviewers who said it sucks so bad because there's nothing you can do about it......... that is simply not true.  The TV does factory default to start/turn on at the Amazon Fire home screen, but THERE *IS* A DISPLAY SETTING for you to set the TV to turn on/start at the last input/channel you were on when you turned the TV off last.  (See picture).Now that being said, this really is a great TV; I am entirely happy with my purchase (and I have never really been that excited about buying a new TV).  I remodeled my bedroom and I was looking to replace my 20-year-old tube TV for relatively cheap.  This TV fit my budget, it sits great on my dresser, and because of the angle of my roof/ceiling I really could not fit a bigger TV even if I wanted.At the same time I also ""cut the cord"" and got rid of cable in my house.  I wanted a smart tv so I could use my streaming apps (DirectTV Now, Netflix) and I already had a Fire stick in my living room, so having the ""Fire"" platform built into the TV is a great option.  There are certain things I don't like about Amazon Fire but having used other platforms (Roku, GooBang Doo/ MXII &amp; XB-III/Android Box), Fire is the best option for my bedroom.  And I didn't want to have additional hardware/boxes &amp; separate remote controls to deal with in my room, so I love that it is all integrated into the TV and I only have 1 remote to deal with.I have a fairly large master bedroom, and I have my desk at the other side of the room with a PC/router and a separate amp/speakers for the PC.  Before setting up the TV I ran some wiring (3 wires) along the baseboards from my desk to the TV -- a Cat5 (wired network for TV), HDMI (video from computer to TV), and a RG6 coax (digital sound FROM the tv back to my amp).  The TV itself doesn't have a digital coax output (it does have SPDIF out); a 50-foot fiber optic cable would have been way too expensive, so I bought a $20 SPDIF to coax converter for the back of the TV.  I like that the TV has a wired ethernet connection, because I'm not a fan of streaming over wireless, especially when there are like 20 other wireless devices already on the network.With my cabling in place, I was ready to rock-n-roll.  Opened the box, plugged the tv &amp; wires in, turned it on.  We had lift off.  There was a first-time setup video that played; I skipped past it but for the novice user it might be informative.  On screen programming was fairly simple and straight-forward.  The biggest decision was whether to set the TV to ""Full"" or ""Basic"" mode (which was probably explained in the video but I skipped past it).  BASIC mode is just native OTA channels, inputs, and 6 built-in apps (NetFlix, PSVue, HBO, etc).  FULL mode gives you access to the entire Fire application and app store, but you will need to already have or create a new Fire account.  Obviously I chose Full mode.From there, I was determined to show all the reviewers wrong by finding the setting that controls start up behavior.  I knew it had to be there.  It is.  Settings &gt; Display &amp; Sounds &gt; Power On &gt; Last Input.  GOOD, because I am one of those people that likes the TV to turn onto the last channel/input I was watching.  So there we have it, my only real reservation to initially buying the TV was found and fixed.  I went through all the other settings and set them to my preferences.  Then I went to the App store and downloaded the apps I use.  I also deleted the pre-installed apps that I will never use.I also bought an OTA digital antenna.  Since I've had cable for the last 20 years, I never dealt with that analog-to-digital conversion that happened 10+ years ago, and I never experienced all the new .2 and .3 digital channels there are now.  Wow.  After scanning stations, I had 84 OTA channels available.  Honestly, there's enough on regular TV for me to watch that I don't really use the streaming apps.  Why didn't I get rid of cable 10 years ago???THE ONLY CON I have with this TV, is the way it displays OTA channels in the guide and in the quick-view bar.1) The guide sorts by channel ID (alpha).  I wish it sorted by channel number, or gave me the option to sort by channel #.  In fact, it doesn't even show the channel # until you select a channel.  I know in the modern era we are getting away from #'s.  But I still like my channel #'s.  If I want channel 9, I want to go scroll to channel 9, but instead I have to scroll all the way to the bottom to find WGN.2) I miss having channel up and channel down buttons.  Everything is through the ""guide"" now.  You can press the down button, and you get a quick-select menu, which I find more convenient that the ""guide.""  I would still rather flip from one channel to the next with 1 click and not have to go through menus.3) YOu can set stations as your ""favorite"" and then show only favorites.  But that only applies to the guide.  The quick-select menu still shows every single station available.  Since the quick select menu shows recently viewed stations first, my solution was just to go view each of my favorites, and then they show up first before all the other channels.Given the few ""cons"" which are negligible, I would still buy this TV again, and I may end up buying a larger version of it for my living room the next time my projector lamp goes out.  Definitely 5 stars for value received to cost.","2,130"

5.0,"Best Toshiba Smart 4K TV
  
","September 9, 2018",Yes,"I bought this 50-inch Toshiba on 2018 Prime Day for $289.99 and I had to buy it for that price. I have two other Toshiba TVs. One isn't a Smart TV and the other has Google Chromecast built in. This Toshiba with the Amazon Fire Stick built-in is much better.  The menu is very easy to navigate and you don't have to use an app from your phone to operate the smart functions. Setup was super easy and fairly quick, but needed some software update time. Most importantly, the picture and sound are great. I have a soundbar, but the speakers on the TV alone are loud enough and have a quality sound. I definitely think this Toshiba deserves 5 Stars for the price and yes I'm a grown man that watches cartoons if you saw the pictures.Update: I've had this TV for several months and it is still going strong. The picture is still crisp and it is continuously on for hours throughout the day. I've seen many reviews about losing internet connection, but I had a simple remedy to my internet issue. I did lose connection once when I moved my TV and had to disconnect the ethernet wire. I could not get the TV to connect to the internet after I plugged the ethernet cable back in and the wireless internet could not connect. The internet didn't connect until I did a factory reset and never had anymore issues. Even with that small issue that I had, I continue to love my Toshiba!",706

","November 6, 2018",Yes,"I normally don't write product reviews, but the quality of this Amazon-branded item is so poor that a review is needed.  The issue with this system began about 3 months after purchase.  At first, I thought the issue was with our cable service; however, after closer inspection, the issue stems from the product manufacturer, Toshiba. I purchased the system during my first ever Prime Day purchase, direct from Amazon.  The screen just glitches out and then goes solidly black. Unplugging the television only reproduces the same glitches.  Now, someone from Geek Squad is headed to my home to look at shoddy, defective, equipment.  While I am hopeful that this Amazon-branded product will be replaced, I will not hold my breath.",620

It is now down, yet again. I have contacted Amazon, Best Buy, and Toshiba. No luck. The issue is NOT the internet because every other device in the house is fully connected without issues.

1.0,"Extremely Faulty TV
  
","August 22, 2018",Yes,"Thank goodness for that 30-day return policy because we got two of these TV's and both stopped working within a week of receiving. The first TV worked for a few days and then lost functionality of most of the buttons on the remote. For a smart TV, it's important that you can use the limited amount of buttons that are on the remote. We thought it was the remote so we had Toshiba send us a brand new remote. After we got the new remote we tried using that and had the same exact issues. I tried using the fire TV remote on my iPhone and had the same issues - we had to assume it was the TV at this point and sent it back for an exchange. When we got the new TV everything worked well.... for 2 days. On day 3 the screen went completely black and never came back on. We could hear what the TV was playing but could not see anything. The screen was completely shot. We packed it back up and sent it back to amazon (again) and just ordered a different brand. Too bad this TV was so faulty, because we really liked it when it worked for those few short days. I didn't want to order another and have it crap out on me after the 30-day return policy.",384
5.0,"Great features, great value, great TV
  
","July 1, 2018",Yes,"I usually wait a month or more to review a product to insure I give a fair accounting of it.  But this Amazon Alexa enabled TV is just to good to wait in the face of some poor reviews from people who didn't realize what they were purchasing or never used Fire-TV and Alexa before, both of which require a learning curve to love it.PRO's:Ease of setup  - Took it out of the double packed boxes installed the stand legs, connect the power cord, and antenna cable, put the batteries in the remote and turned it on by the remote. It immediately went through the setup process where I put in my Amazon account information. That fast there was all of my Amazon Fire and Prime programs and history.  Next it scanned the antenna for channels and found 15 more then the old TV could fine.  In 30 minutes (I'm a Old man a younger man could do it in half the time) it was up and running.Video - Great looking video. Played moves off the air and 4K content frome prime all of which is as good or very close to the much more expensive TV's.Sound - The audio was great for vt speakers. I later hook up my old surround sound system which was even better.Ease of Use - With Alexa control and the one putton channel guide finding just the right thing to watch is a breeze, but once again a learning curve to it.CON's:Shipping boxes - Good news / bad news the shipping boxes weighs as much as the TV.  No pissedoff delivey man is going to hurt that TV. The bad part for me is I'm a 74 year old disabled veteran.  If I do this again I'll ask someone to help.Manual (what manual) - Other then a small quick setup guide there is no printed instructions.  Maybe soon Toshiba will put one on their website. For me with little to do all day I was able to hunt and peck my way through it but others might not have the time.All and all this one great TV especially if you are vested in Amazon Prime.  All the feathers at this price is a great value.","1,778"

","September 1, 2018",Yes,"During Prime Day I purchased a 50” Toshiba Fire TV, sold by Best Buy. At the same time, I had an Xfinity XR15 box replacement sent so I could take advantage of the TVs 4K Ultra.Trying to pair the XR15 remote creates a conflict between the XR15 remote and the TVs remote. Each remote will only fully work about 20% of the time. Each remotes buttons will periodically lose functionality. The volume buttons on the XR15 remote rarely work. The power button on each remote almost never work.Initially, I believed this was a hardware problem with the television. I contacted Amazon, who in turn contacted Best Buy, who in turn sent a Geek Squad tech to my place. The tech and I worked at this for about an hour (I’ve worked in QA for the past ten years), and we determined that there seems to be a conflict caused because the TVs remote is Bluetooth, but the XR15 remote appears to be IR. Something’s going wrong and it seems like there needs to be a software update to address this. I’ve tried every available Toshiba code, but none eliminate this problem. I’ve also tried using. Logitech Harmony universal remote, but the same problem occurs.The TVs remote works with no issue, until the XR15 remote gets paired to control the television. Once the XR15 remote is paired and it starts receiving user input, the problems begin. It’s like the two remotes are fighting for dominance, then they get tired and stop working altogether.Furthermore, I don’t know why this is considered to have 4K Ultra resolution. The picture quality, crispness and color brightness is far inferior to the Samsung 1080 tv I replaced with this one.",190

","October 3, 2018",Yes,"This tv worked fine when i first purchased it on prime day 2018, but a month later issues started happening. First the screen would go to the screen saver mode while watching it. We would turn the tv off and back on and the problem would  stop for awhile. This would happen frequently. But the real problem started a few weeks  later. The standby light on the set would go out and there would be no power. We have to unplug it and replug it several times before power was on. Now after doing that the remote would frequently not be able to turn the tv off. It is frustrating.Update:  I tried to get warranty service for this tv. I called Best Buy, who said call Toshiba, who then gave me a number to call. It was the Geek squad at Best Buy. They said they would handle the warranty service on this tv, but I lived outside of their service district, but they would send an outside technician to my home. Next day I got a voice mail from Best Buy saying they were not responsible from the repair and left a telephone number to call if I had questions. I called that number and it was a survey where I could win a cruise. I called back to Best Buy and they said they do some warranty work on Toshiba televisions, but not on this one. I called Amazon, who tried to help me get the warranty repair. After 38 minutes of doing research and making calls, Amazon said it was like going in circles. Even though is was after the 30 day return period, they authorized a refund with a restocking fee reduction to refunded on my credit card. So I packed the tv up, hauled it to a UPS store, and waited.Over a week after the tv was returned, I got a letter from Best Buy saying they did not have to accept my return, but they did and enclosed a store credit for the full amount paid.  I really do not want a store credit to Best Buy. This whole experience has been not only frustrating, but time consuming. I think Amazon should reevaluate their relationship with Best Buy.",164

Every time I pause something to take a phone call or do a quick chore, I come back and the TV has turned itself off! It's a little thing, but it is seriously annoying! The last Amazon Fire TV had this feature too, so I had returned it. I was hoping that since this is a different manufacturer, they wouldn't have the same stupid ""feature."" WRONG! Is it seriously that abnormal for me to want my TV to stay on when I have turned it on!?! This would seriously be a four or five star TV if it wasn't for this simple glitch in the programming. Amazon, PLEASE fix this!! PLEASE, give me a way to disable the sleep timer!Update 10/29/18: Someone from Amazon Support called me within a day of posting this review and seemed very concerned about this problem. He asked a bunch of follow up questions and said he would send it all to the technical team. Sadly to say, I have now owned this tv for a little over three months now, and Amazon/Toshiba (They couldn't tell me whether the fault lies with the Fire TV software or the TV itself) have STILL not rolled out a fix for this problem. Very disappointing. And still VERY annoying!Update 6/21/19: Got an OTA update with ""bug fixes"" this week. Unfortunately the one ""bug"" I experience has not been addressed! The tv STILL turns itself off! Not only that, but the bug has gotten worse! It used to shut off after 15 minutes, now it shuts off after about 8. THIS IS RIDICULOUS! It's been almost a year! Why has this not been fixed! I am VERY disappointed in Amazon for putting out such an annoying and substandard product!",65
5.0,"One of the Best Tv's for the Money
  
","August 23, 2018",Yes,"Now. let me start off with saying that i'm not an expert on TV's. My first HDTV was a Vizio 42 inch 1080p that i bought almost 5 years ago after high school. It looked great. I Paid $420 for it. I thought i got a pretty good deal on it. Fast forward to 2018 and 4k is still settling in and technology is moving forward. I was at work during Prime week and the website was terribly slow but i still wanted to see what they had in stock. I stumbled across this TV as i was going to be in the market for one during the holiday season 2018. When i found this TV, I was shocked at how much it was! $280! For a 50 inch 4k Fire TV with Alex built in, That's almost half the cost of my old vizio. I thought it was too good to be true. Reviews were mixed but i wanted to take a stab at it anyways. I ordered it and it was here 3 days later. My initial impressions were ""eh"". Setup was a breeze but there was more than that i had noticed. I decided on comparing it with my vizio with some Good Mythical Morning on YouTube. I Know it's compressed video but it was the best i had to work with at first. I watched one episode and I was kind of Disappointed. The Brightness was good but the color was kind of dull overall and over saturated on some parts of the image like a person's face, but i wasn't giving up there. Setting the TV's Picture color setting from default to natural completely changed the game. The Color was great! Everything seemed correct with pulling up a color correction test on YouTube and it looked great! The Speakers were OK but that doesn't bother me because i have a dedicated 5.1 Surround System that blows the socks on the TV speakers. I really wanted a bigger size TV overall since the 42 inch wasn't quite the size I wanted. The 50 Inch was the perfect size for my TV stand and it matched the room which is a pretty small living room but it worked just fine. Now it's $400 and i still think it's a good deal considering my 42 inch was $20 more. I run the TV 1080p still because my laptop does not output 4k but It still looks great. The Fire TV portion is good for what it offers. More Ad's than I liked but for the value, No big deal. The 4k Netflix Shows look great. HDR Looks really good. The only downside to this TV for me is when i'm playing Dolby Digital through any apps on the smart portion of the TV, the volume seems to fluctuate. I'm sure this can be fixed with a software update but It's what i experienced. I would give it a go if you're interested in getting a good TV for the Money and hey if It doesn't work out, 30 Day Return!",61
3.0,"GREAT TV AND NOT SO GREAT AT THE SAME TIME
  
","November 29, 2018",Yes,"The good and bad about this TV cancel each other out and I'll give it a solid 3 stars. First off I bought the 43 inch version from Best Buy on Black Friday at a price of only $129. At that price I almost feel like I stole the TV.  So the price I paid is definitely not an issue. However this is my first smart TV and I wasn't prepared for how complex Toshiba has made it to simply watch TV.  So many settings and options. It may be a little too complicated for some. I'm pretty tech savvy and this TV even started to give me a headache. I'll start with the bad. First off, whoever invented the remote control for this Television should be slapped. It's missing about half of the buttons every other remote control in the world has. There are no numbers on it and there is no up/down button to channel surf in the typical way. It's actually quite frustrating.  It may be the worst remote control that I've ever seen. Secondly..... I am not a fan of how this television integrates regular live television with the internet. It combines everything in a way which actually makes it more difficult to find what you are looking for.  It's nice that the TV has a channel guide, but it's not a particularly good one. It groups Networks together by ""NAME ONLY"". NBC, CBS, ABC..etc...  So, if you are like me and like to see actual CHANNEL NUMBERS or CALL LETTERS, you are going to be in for a disappointment with the built in guide on this television. Also.....I have a unique problem which other people may not even notice or care about, but I have this TV sharing an Over The Air antenna with other TV's at my house. When I turn this TV on it actually causes some of my other TV's to lose weaker channels. It's not an antenna issue since I've never had this happen with any other TV before. I suspect that there may be so much ""SMART"" coming out of this Toshiba TV that it causes interference in a way that no other TV does. Just keep that in mind if you are using this TV with your own antenna. Now onto the great about this TV. It really does offer so much more than any other TV that I've ever had. Thanks to built in Amazon Fire, you will have your choice of watching more content than you ever had before. I also love the fact that you can surf the web on this TV as well. You can use Firefox or another built in browser called SILK. I love that I can do this! This TV also offers excellent sound. Probably the best sound that I've ever heard from built in speakers. Everything is highly customizable.  Same goes for the picture. Not the greatest picture I've ever seen right out of the box, but once you get into the custom menu and mess with it a bit, this TV really provides an excellent picture.  So don't forget to go into the settings for both audio and video. You will end up with a very nice viewing experience after you mess with the settings enough. Bottom line...... this is a great TV with some minor setbacks. Good picture, great sound and access to lots and lots of content. If it only had a better remote and was better at separating ""LIVE LOCAL STATIONS"" from all the web content, I then would be able to rate this TV higher. In the future, Toshiba should add at least one more button to the remote control for just ""LIVE TV"". That way it's not all meshed in with the web stuff. Some people just want to sit down and watch TV the old fashion way. This television complicates that process with unnecessary difficulty. Still a good TV though.",40

","October 4, 2018",Yes,"So I bought this 50” Toshiba TV on Prime Day 2018 for about $250 I think. I was in the market for a new TV for the bedroom, and I was just about to purchase a Samsung TV with the Fire TV Cube. I knew Prime Day would be great to buy the cube, so I waited. When the day arrived, I stumbled across this Toshiba TV and thought, “Well shooot... I’m basically getting a 2-for-1 on this deal!”Now before all the videophiles start booing my review, let me be clear in that the picture quality and aesthetics are not as solid as comparable or top of the line Samsung’s, but for the price and the location of the tv, I couldn’t pass up the $250 price tag (especially because Fire TV is a necessity for the way I driver my entertainment).Having said that, I am extremely happy with the TV and would purchase another one for any other bedroom in my home. If I could make one subjective criticism, it would be that I wish the remote control was a little more universal. My Samsung TV’s remote is capable of controlling many of my DTV receiver functions and that makes it EXTREMELY convenient in the living room!Hope this helps...",40
4.0,"Easy to set up &amp; use - a winner in our family!
  
","August 28, 2018",Yes,"I ordered this TV during Amazon Prime day. Our other TV died and this seemed like a good replacement. About 45 days in, it's a winner. It was easy to set up and mount on our existing wall mount. We don't have cable, but it hooked up easily with our flat antenna. As a plus, thanks to the Fire interface, there's a guide that now shows us what's on all our local channels. A small thing, but a surprisingly useful one.The Fire interface is easy to use - it's just like our previous Fire TV stick. The TV easily paired with our Echo - took less than a minute. We can control such functions as on/off, mute, volume, tuning to channels, opening apps, and more. Honestly, there is probably so much more we could do, but we are simple people. It's so easy to use that both our six-year-olds can control the TV via both the Echo and the remote. (This has both positive and negative aspects!)I'm not a technology geek, but both the adults and two kids like the sound, picture, and all other aspects of the TV. It gets us the wide range of apps we desire since we don't have cable, and it's easy to access Netflix via the remote button.Overall, we all love this TV so far.

","June 26, 2018",Yes,"For $399, this is a really nice TV. It's not as bright as some of the TVs at the $1k pricepoint. The audio is fine for a basic experience, and stays clear even when it gets pretty loud. The remote control is clean and easy to use with minimal extra features (apart from that odd Sony placement). I really like that you have to press a button for the Alexa usage rather than having it be always-on and listening in the room. Alexa continues to be best in class for voice recognition and show search across multiple apps (e.g., finding a show in Netflix).The only awkward thing is that the setup process is not what you might be used to from a FireTV or other Amazon product - it doesn't come preconfigured with your Amazon account and you need to log in and choose what apps to install. There are also a bunch of questions I didn't really understand (e.g., Full vs. Limited experience?). Netflix and other apps continue to have a tedious setup process of entering passwords manually for each application, even if you have other devices with Netflix or even other FireTV and Alexa devices in the house.The defaults are pretty good, with allowing Alexa to control the TV's power off by default, though sharing personal information with advertisers for a ""more customized experience"" is unfortunately on by default.",270

However, it continues this problem every other day. Have to reset the tv to get it to connect to wifi. Apple TV plugged into this TV connects fine, laptop has no problems, Roku is working great, Playstation has no problems at all- all plugged into this TV via HDMI.

","December 11, 2018",Yes,"I reallly want to like this TV, and hopefully future software/firmware updates will fix it.  If they don't, I will join the class-action suit.I could really expound on the topic of this TV endlessly, but in the interest of writing a review someone will read, I will do my level best to keep this brief.I bought this TV thinking it would dovetail into the purchase of a Fire TV Recast.  Based on my experience with this TV, I no longer want a Fire TV Recast.For the last 5+ years we have used a Win7 Home Theater PC in conjunction with our primary living room TV display.  We have a two tuner HD Home Run on the network.  It works great.  But the sun is setting on Windows 7 and once a year (or so) I have to reinstall Windoze on the HTPC -kind of a pain.  I should mention, we are not cable or satellite subscribers and have only a TV antenna pulling signals from Toledo and Detroit.  We looked at options for replacing the HTPC with a Tablo, or other such thing.  I eschewed options which included a subscription charge for the program guide service (Windows Program Guide is free).Upon getting this TV, I was thrilled, I liked the interface, it feels suddenly like we have more than just an antenna on the roof.  Upon using the TV for only a short time, I am extremely disappointed (bordering on furious).  Here are observations about this TV that piss me off:1.  Say goodbye to knowing what channel you are switching to.  You won't know until you have selected it.  It doesn't show you the channel numbers in the guide.2.  Even after eliminating the secondary singals from the listings, you still often see two of every show.3.  If there is not any associated data for the channel, fuggedaboutit!  You can't watch it!  I've got stations that can't feed the metadata to the air -I don't get to watch these channels.4.  Not all subchannels show.  I have an NBC affiliate running TBD, a network for Wil Wheaton's geeky friends to play Magic the Gathering on -it doesn't show.  It just ain't there.  Go to any other TV in the house and there it is, but it isn't on the Fire TV.5.  The damn super high res TV won't handle the highest support resolution from my HTPC!  It'll show, and format properly (and I'm HDMI out to HDMI in, I'm not converting anything) but try to watch TV and it shows lines, artifacts, it breaks up.  Terrible.  Lower the resolution, it is OK, but doesn't scale to the entire screen.  ARRGHHH!!6.  Does your wireless router suck?  Is it moody sometimes?  Mine is, and now I have to replace it because I need Internet to watch over the air TV!  ARRRGHH!7.  The remote control does not have a dedicated button to switching inputs.  This is absolutely crazy.8.  I still have not been able to have my Echo do anything to this TV.  I have registered the TV in the app, I have the setting for the TV set right, Alexa cannot find the TV.  I changed the name.  Still can't find it.And there is even more nitpicky stuff that I won't go into.My wife hates this TV, and is now watching the TV that this one replaced exclusively (in the basement).  Some of these issues will be addressed.  I'm sure I've missed ten things and need to comb through my settings too.  But I no longer revel in the tedious setup of such things.  I bought this thing to be intuitive and easy to set up and use.  So far, I have not been able to set up and use the TV to my satisfaction.  Here is the major headline to remember if you are an OTA viewer -YOU WON'T GET YOUR FULL CHANNEL LINEUPHad I known this at the outset, I would have not purchased the TV.  Amazon needs to fix this, and work very hard to improve their program guide.EDIT UPDATE 7/20/19 --  I have contacted Amazon requesting to return this TV for a refund.  In looking back through my previous review I am reminded of other things that bother me about this TV, but the most irksome thing is that you can set the PINS and get OTP codes for your phone for purchase, but this TV is perpetually tripping you into signing up for something you don't want.  I just today decided it was time to rid myself of this awful TV when I could not view live OTA TV and was instead stuck uninstalling PLUTO and removing it form my program lineup.  I can't stand this TV.. And life is too short to.... PLEASE WAIT.... For the live TV coming from the ANTENNA on MY ROOF!AMAZON!  THIS THING SUCKS!",28

It's also glitchy at times with the FireTV OS needing to refresh to show a recent purchase or to be able to display part of the menu.If you do buy this, keep in mind that it's a product from Best Buy--they're the sole distributor of it. So after Amazon's return period has ended (Best Buy's is only 2 weeks), you're SOL if something goes wrong. I'm still within the first year of use so they are trying to fix it but it's been a mess. And one of the Best Buy employees I spoke with (while handling the repair) even said that FireTV is junk and Toshiba isn't great anymore.The Good--1. Picture is nice. For a tv of it's price range I think the 4K is fine.2. When it works, the FireTV OS is convenient.The Bad--1. You're locked in to using the FireTV OS so if it breaks, you're toast.2. As mentioned above, the return window isn't long.3. Overall quality is low, so this is truly you get what you pay for.I recommend saving a bit more to get a reliable TV that relies less on the Smart tv capabilities and more on the TV itself. I have a Samsung Smart TV that's 6 years old and still running great. But I'm not required to use the Samsung Smart Hub in order to play content--it's input focused, allowing more flexibility.

I'd also like to mention you can't cast anything directly to the TV from the PC, as that's strictly a Google product, so GL with that! I highly suggest getting something else.

I was replacing a Samsung 40"" LCD that's 10+ years old, so ironically the footprint of the 43"" was slightly smaller. Picture quality is plenty fine and the app integration is nice. I was pleasantly surprised with the integration of the TV antenna and HDMI inputs, very smooth and I like the instant preview of the tuner in the interface without having to truly switch to it.I'm a PlayStation Vue user for my TV streaming, so Amazon TV's app is one of the more polished options, a major reason why I wasn't terribly sad over not getting the Roku-powered TV. I don't see any slowness in the interface (something I'm used to seeing in the Fire TV Sticks...wasn't sure if it'd possibly be a thing with the Fire TV integration or not).

Their experiences were most likely due to damage during SHIPPING, not because the tv is defective. This is what frustrates me about people who immediately write negative reviews NOT about the product but about another issue.This is a fantastic tv. I replaced an 8-year old 28-inch Toshiba tv with this 43-inch Toshiba. It was very easy to install (my old wall mount worked very well with this one), and I did so by myself. Also, it’s very easy to set up on-screen. I already have Prime and Hulu, and this tv works seamlessly with both. There are a ton of apps, as well, that you can download. The Amazon Silk browser is a great browser, too. I use a yoga website to do yoga and can easily stream those videos from the website using the Silk browser.The picture is outstanding, and the sound quality is very good.

OK, on with the review.  The TV has a nice picture, the sound is also good.  But sadly, the remote might be the worst one I have ever gotten with a TV.  Seriously, if anyone important reads this pass it on to Toshiba.  Remotes should last for many years, not many weeks.  And remote batteries should last for at least many months, not many days.  My remote stopped working after about 2 months, I had to do surgery on it to get it working again.  To summarize my trauma, the problem is with how the batteries interface with the PCB.Back to the TV itself, it is really light weight and not very durable.  As many people have posted, they received a ""broken"" TV.  Well, maybe, but more likely they broke it removing it from the box or installing it.  Yup, it is that light weight.  When moving this TV use two people and be gentle.  If you have Amazon Prime, its a cool TV.  If not, probably not so much.

4.0,"Great TV Not Suitable For A PC Monitor or Gaming
  
","September 3, 2018",Yes,"The online services for this monitor are awesome.  Unfortunately for me I bought this as a monitor for my TV.  The published refresh rate for this 4k tv is 60hz which should be fine for a PC monitor.  Unfortunately at 4k this TV only can operate at 24mz.  Anything under 60hz (and even 60hz a bit when playing games) will cause serious lag between mouse movements and the display movement with motion blur.  I had to go all the way down to 1080p 1920 x 1080 to get the published 60hz.  Switching to a ""Premium HDMI cable should allow the TV to get to it's 4K resolution however.Input lag is how long it takes for a display to update after it receives a signal. In Movie mode, the Toshiba Fire TV Edition shows a poor 70.6ms input lag. Switching to Game mode cuts that down to a much more reasonable 40.2ms, but that's still far too high to consider it to be a good TV for gaming",21

I don't have any Alexa devices to pair with it but I'm sure they work well.- 4k and HDR look good. (But not great)- Built in speakers are better than expected.- Setup was a breeze using an Amazon account.- I have had a reliable wifi connection, but it's now hardwired using Ethernet.Cons- Has a lot of motion blur since it is only 60 Hz.- Non HDR shows are fairly dark, doesn't seem to be an issue with HDR shows though. I use this TV in my room with the windows closed and it is fine for that.- Few HDMI ports, but not much if an issue since it has so many smart features built in.Overall verdict: Great TV for the prime day price, but not worth full price. There are a lot of ads but it doesn't bother me since I got it for such a good deal. I would buy again if it went for sale under $300.",18

There is no extra Fire Stick and it integrates the external TV antenna so that you do not have to change digital sources. It was easy to set up using my Internet using the on screen prompts.

1.0,"FireTV feature is not worth it
  
","June 9, 2019",Yes,"Being a fan of FireTv devices and our old television burning out, this seemed to make sense.When we first got the unit, it worked as expected. Started noticing some glitches during the first month, like screen freezes, lost signals, and the occasional flickering. It wasn't clear if the TV or the cable service was to blame for these issues.Then it became clear; the TV would completely crash and reboot whenever using apps like Hulu or Netflix. Watching cable or local channels were fine, but anytime an app was used to view/stream video from the internet, the TV would eventually crash. (Especially during camera panning or quick action scenes.)I have three other FireTV devices, not built into a TV set, and we have never had this issue. So I'm guessing they made this TV as cheap as possible with an inferior memory/chipset that can't handle the workload. It's clear the TV works fine for cable/antenna viewing, but the functions as a FireTV are not there.So now, to avoid the crashes, I attached an old FireTV box via HDMI cable. No crashes since I did that.  We avoid using the built-in FireTV as much as possible.Bottom line: If you want this TV because of the FireTV option - you can do better. We would have done better purchasing a standard HDTV without the built-in FireTV -- and then attach the old FireTV unit to that.",15

We don't use the voice feature much, sometimes it (Alexa voice) snags (hey it's Amazon not Google) and doesn't work but only a few times. Put the VidAngel app on my TV, now I can EASILY watch Netflix (which is almost 100% rated R shows these days) without worry. And I downloaded a bunch of other apps I'll probably never use. How cool!We don't like.... the glowing light on the front when the TV's off. It's in our bedroom, and the glowing LED is like the eye of Mordor at night. I mean really, what's up with everything these days that has the slightest bit of power flowing through it have the brightest daggum LED glowing, this TV was the worst though! Electrical tape fixed that though.We do like.... lots of inputs, but with having Prime Video, VidAngel, Netflix, etc all built in through the remote I mean we cut out some inputs we used to need. Just have the Chromecast plugged in to it and a blu-ray player which we really never use anymore. Oh, yeah, and a DirecTV receiver. I forgot we still had that... I like being able to rename the inputs though and use the remote to say ""Switch to satellite."" However, Chromecast was not an option to use. Good grief Amazon get over it already! Also, the interface like I said is really fast. I was worried there would be lag. Although it's sorta bad because everyone in the house from the two year old up, even the dogs, know how to tune in to whatever they want to watch.The speakers sound really decent, better than expected, I mean you still need a Klipsch sound system but until you can afford one after buying the TV the built in speakers are fine, especially in a smaller room. I like all the apps although I think I'll only use just a few. But it's nice to know there is expand-ability there.Overall, probably not a bad idea to replace the living room TV with one of these eventually...",16
2.0,"Cheap! Does not last and the power save functionality is infuriating!!!
  
","December 8, 2018",Yes,"*UPDATE 12/07/2019*This TV SUCKS! We've barely had it over a year now and it freezes up constantly, requiring a reboot! And as I alluded to in my previous review, the power save feature was designed by morons! There is no way to control this feature, so the TV shuts off by itself, CONSTANTLY!If you ever need to pause your movie/show/program to go to the bathroom, grab something in the kitchen, or talk to someone on the phone, you'd better do it fast! If you're not fast enough, be prepared to come back to a TV that has shut itself off, requiring you to spend a few minutes having to once again find what you were watching previously and restart the program. It's a giant PAIN IN THE A$$!As the old adage goes, ""You get what you pay for""!Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere, you'll be happy you did!---We've had this TV for a few months now and so far we love it! This TV is an enormous ""bang for the buck""!IMHO, this TV's picture rivals that of far more expensive TVs I've owned. Quite frankly, I can't believe the picture quality you get at this price level. The TV is relatively bright with good contrast and colors and the black-levels are inky deep which is a must for me when it comes to a TV. I cannot stand a TV where the blacks look more dark-gray than black.The sound quality is not a strength of this TV and if you intend on purchasing this TV, I'd advise you use a soundbar or speakers with it, otherwise, you may constantly struggle with sound clarity. More specifically, you'll often be questioning what an actor/actress just said during scenes with dialogue.The Amazon Home screen could use some work as it can appear cluttered at times -- there is a lot going on - however, once you get used to it, it's tolerable. Also, this can become a fairly moot point if you choose to use Alexa commands the majority of the time as you won't need to navigate the cluttered and sometimes confusing menu.My biggest complaint about this TV is the extremely infuriating lack of a setting or control for the power save functionality, which is a tremendous oversight by the developers if you ask me! Seriously guys/gals, unless I'm missing something, there appears to be no way to control the amount of time during which this TV will power down and go into either sleep or off mode, whichever it is. So, when you need to go to the bathroom or decide to slip into the kitchen to grab a bite, be prepared to come back to a TV that has turned itself off! This becomes extremely annoying as you will have to turn the TV back on and once again find what it is that you were watching from whatever app you were watching it from. Honestly, how is it none of the developers noticed this would be an issue?! Obviously, they could benefit from a lesson in UX design!Other than this tremendous oversite, the TV is well worth the price of admission, even more so if you get it during one of Amazon's many sales!Fingers crossed that the developers add a setting to control the power save feature in the near future!",15

4.0,"Everything I was looking for in a TV at almost half the cost
  
","September 30, 2018",Yes,"Because it is a Fire TV the integration with Alexa is outstanding. No more fumbling through menus to change inputs. Just name your HDMI port and say, ""Alexa Input Cable"", she figures it out from there and switches the TV's input to HDMI port named ""Cable""!  The TV can also be set to default to the last HDMI port used, rather than the Fire streaming menu; this way it works like a normal TV until you want to use the Fire functions (then on the remote or Alexa just say ""Go Home"" to go to the Fire TV home screen, or press the home button on the remote). TV On / Off, volume up/down, start Hulu, play Prime music? Yep, you can do it all with Alexa or the remote.The picture and sound are great. Saved us money on a sound bar and no extra remote needed!We can't say enough good things about our TV.  The price is also great. We couldn't wait for shipping so we purchased ours directly from Best Buy. First time I've been in a store (other than a grocery or gift store) in three years! Normally I buy everything online.One month update:  Still love the TV. I've knocked a point off because the sound level can change dramatically between power offs. One time you turn it on and a  level 20 is a comfortable level. Turn it off, turn it on later, and 20 is WAY too loud, have to turn it down to 5 to get the same level of volume!This can probably be fixed with a firmware update, so I'm waiting. I would really love to see more frequent updates. There are a few minor improvements they could (and probably will) make. Many are probably waiting for an Amazon update rather than Toshiba), such as better Alexa integration (try to get Amazon Prime music to play through Alexa is next to impossible. Amazon video works pretty well). It would also be nice if Alexa and the TV would communicate, so when you say ""Alexa"" it would mute the TV sound while you're talking. Otherwise the TV simply drowns out your commands (its hard enough to wake up Alexa when the TV volume is turned up).I would still give this TV a 5 star rating if they fix that annoying volume problem. It's fun watching my wife jump, but I'm starting to feel sorry for her!",15
5.0,"Best Blind TV Experience Ever!!
  
","June 29, 2018",Yes,"This was a wonderful investment. Best tv experience I’ve had being blind. There’s so much in doing for yourself.I did complete setup without assistance. Voice View narrated every step. Even tells you screen off when powering off.Gone are the days of how many presses for input. A heads up for my blind brothers and sisters... the top HDMI port is HDMI 1. This is also the HDMI ARC for your audio receiver, sound bar.The only difficulty for blind is attaching the stand. A left and right which I guarantee you’ll never figure out. Neighbor attached stand and checked to make sure no damage, or dead pixels.Thank you Amazon, Best Buy, and Toshiba. Best accessible tv I’ve encountered for blind consumers.Initial voice view is activated by pressing Back and Menu for 2 seconds. The left and right button above the ring. Remote is slightly different from Fire TV. There is a voice view tutorial for the remote.Also you can change inputs with voice. Just say input 1, or HDMI 1. Great speakers and value for this price point.PS: connecting to Echo Dot was a breeze. Link in Alexa app. I can change volume and inputs with Dot. Along with power on/off.Update:Another benefit found for blind customers. Software updates on TV’s, Apple TV, etc. can be difficult. Without audible cues it can be hard to tell when done. When software reboots it lets you know disconnect from input. When a device restarts, device reconnects to input with voice cue.It took awhile to figure out, but changing input name is possible. Go to inputs under settings tab, highlight the input name you want to change, don't select... Instead press menu twice. An options menu will pop up. Their are like 14 options to name the input.By going to tv.toshiba@toshiba.com you’ll find a full users manual. Model LF621U. I recommend for hidden and not obvious features.",378

Plex, Netflix, Prime Video, and DirecTV Now, and I have access to pretty much every piece of video ever made at the touch of a button. Far removed from the days when I thought it was awesome to put a video file on a USB stick and walk it out to my DVD player.The only thing I'm disappointed with at this point is the fact that I can't control this with any ""hands free"" Alexa devices (mainly my new 10'' Fire Tablet). It can only be controlled with Echo devices as far as I can tell. That's more of a limitation on the tablet than the tv though I believe.Also.. The Fire OS app store has been weird lately. It took me about 5 hours to download 6 total apps on this tv and the new tablet. I sideloaded play store on the tablet and apps downloaded in seconds like normal. The tv streams 4k from amazon video without issue, but takes 50 minutes to download netflix? come on.Hopefully that'll be resolved shortly.Either way..

Which is crazy so we didn’t do that. My wife called and she talked to somebody different and the customer rep said they would send another remote out right away. So we got the replacement remote and it had the same problem. So by ourselves we reset the tv and that didn’t help.

","June 1, 2019",Yes,"I came home and my old TV wasn't working, and trying everything, it was dead.  I remembered getting an email for a deal of the day offer for this TV at a good price.  I knew it was a Fire TV, and it might be worth considering if I had prime, but Prime doesn't want me (Part of prime is special sales and discounts at Whole Foods.  Whole foods has opened stores through my region, but, along with Trader Joes, and any other decent grocery stores, only puts their stores in trendy neighborhoods, putting a large circle and red X over the entire area anywhere near me, along with other areas which also have noting but small, cruddy and inferior grocery and produce choices).  The TV itself is good for the price.  It is 4K UHD quality, a good refresh rate, good color and color contrast, and quality sound.  Where this TV fails is the Fire TV part.  Yes, I knew I would be inundated with promotions for Amazon.  In this case, a homescreen that just pushes and pushes Amazon Prime or pay for viewing movies and programs.  I don';t see any way to search for anything without tons of stuff only available with Prime or paying Amazon to view.  If I don't have Prime, why can't I search for things that I can get without paying?  And, to find out if you can get what came up in your search without Prime or paying (on one of the other apps you installed), you have to click on each search result separately, then go  back to your search results to click on the next individual result, over and over (since prime results obviously seem to be given priority). Also, there are free apps or apps tat come with channels you get in your cable.  I get the Starz app free.  So, why, when there's a movie available free on the Starz app, does it push a paid viewing of the movie, either through pushing an upgraded paid version of the Starz app as the primary way to view the movie, when, with a couple more clicks past their scam, I see it's available on the version of the Starz app I already have included with my cable, and have installed on the TV.  And, in clicking past their attempted scam to sell me something I have included, the first other choice that it took me to, and I almost accidentally pushed, was the choice to pay Amazon to rent this movie from them, a movie I have free, and shows up clearly as free, but I have to click through multiple attempts by Amazon to defraud me of money for something that they know I get for free.  You can't uninstall the Prime app, unlike apps you installed.  Also, apps, programs and movies fail to load regularly.  You have to frequently reset the TV by unplugging it.  What's the problem?  It's not the internet, as I plugged in an ethernet cable directly from the router with no benefit.  Why don't apps load on this, and why don't programs and movies on apps  not load?  It's not the apps, because, then it wouldn't be all of them.  What's the problem with having things load, when that's the whole point of a smart TV?  And, it also fails to detect the internet that is plugged right into it, and gives me a message that I am not connected to the internet until I have to screw around with it for a while to get it to recognize the internet it is plugged into.  It sometimes fails to respond to the remote.  And, it's not the remote or batteries, because once I get it to respond, the batteries keep working for monthes thereafter (except when it doesn't respond to the remote).  It has listings for my channels from the Pluto app, but frequently, everything is blank with no information or all the channels are doubled, making it unusable, and since it works fine once I clear everything, uninstall and reinstall and reactivate Pluto, ect., taking a few minutes, it's not Pluto.

","February 15, 2019",Yes,"I bought this on Amazon Prime Day in January in spite of all the bad reviews because I had already bought a larger one on Prime Day last July (2018) and haven’t had any problems with it.  I can confirm that the negative reviews were only slightly exaggerated. This is very low quality HD.  I don’t have the vocabulary to accurately describe the problem, so I will say that the picture quality is very poor.  A good HD television should give you seamless and flawless movement. This Toshiba does not provide that seamless-ness.  I can live with that.  What frustrates me is that sometimes the volume is too low for no apparent reason, or it will have no volume at all. The only way to restore the volume has been to turn the TV off and try again.  I noticed that when I would manipulate the Alexa remote to change channels (I’m streaming), the volume would cut out entirely.  Additionally, sometimes, I’ll turn on the unit and my streaming service asks me to login again.  The programmed information “slips” from time to time, requiring me to login before I can use the television. I find this annoying.  In other reviews, people complain about needing to reprogram the television and re-download the apps you use.  That has never happened to me.  I took those negative reviews seriously, and kept the box to be able to re-pack the contents if I needed to return it in 30 days.  I kept it because the television works fine. I use it about 30 minutes every night and it’s reliable. Nevertheless, I believe it’s true that you get what you pay for. I paid less than $150 for this television, so I can live with it, but I wouldn’t recommend this television brand to anyone.",8

NOPE, every time I turn it on, it takes almost a full minute to load up.Secondly, it turns off on it's own for no reason. Picture this, Game of Thrones final season and John Snow just stabbed the queen, dragon opens his mouth, and BAM, TV turns off. This happens at least once during an hour long program, so I literally have stopped watching anything worth while on the Toshiba Fire TV, reverting back to my 8 year old Samsung Plasma TV with Roku device plugged in to HDMI.Seriously a sad excuse for a TV and cheaper brands such as TCL in my home that are older, perform mountains atop this piece of crap.

But, it wasn't. It was actually better than standard because when you hit the ""tv/antenna"" button on the remote it takes you to a channel guide for all of the digital antenna channels it finds for you. They're not necessarily in the same order as they appear on our tv. For instance our channel 57 appears first but that's because it's the ABC affiliate. But it doesn't matter. It has totally changed our TV viewing experience! LOVE IT.

","February 28, 2019",Yes,"Price can't be beat ($129 at the time). So far, everything works as expected, even YouTube using an unexpectedly excellent Web app that integrates pretty well with FireTV. Apparently I don't need Roku now (though it did work just fine plugged into the back of this thing).Wasn't expecting much for the price; and one day in, it's exceeding all hopes. Sure the picture and sound (with built-in speakers) are inferior to pricier TVs, but have nothing to compare it to at the moment. Am happy with both, though a sound bar would be a good addition.Using with Amazon Video and Music, Netflix, Hulu, the faux YouTube app and the Recast (making an antenna unneeded). Shows the back door camera as well.Had a little trouble finding where in the Alexa app to pair with an Echo: Settings | TV &amp; Video. Makes the voice feature more useful than if you had to grab the remote first.Only issues noted:1. UI can briefly freeze and then catch up on all the button presses it missed. It's not as slick as the Roku stick's.2. Ethernet connection failed on initial setup, then seemed to fix itself by magic; no issues since.The warranty was going for a song, so picked up protection for a few years, just in case the cheaper components fail before their time. Have seen a few reviews that noted hardware issues developing down the road. Will see...UPDATE:A couple of weeks in and still going well. Have noticed that the Hulu app seems to be a resource hog (at least on the 32"" model). Sometimes the system slows to a crawl after leaving Hulu and it can take several seconds to open up and launch a show.Added Hulu Live and ESPN (apparently need two apps to watch ESPN) and find it irritating that the ""Live"" portion of Hulu Live does not provided content to the channel guide. Not sure whose fault that is, but there is a list of channel guide providers under Settings, so assume Hulu could implement this feature. Seems really stupid to have to open an app to browse through live TV (and one that doesn't even have a proper channel guide).Have also found that when controlling the TV with an Echo Show, the requested content usually shows up on the Fire TV, but not always (have to add ""on Fire TV"" to make it work in the odd case). No idea how to force it to use the small screen (may not be possible).UPDATE: Turned off background monitoring by a camera app that was using up available resources. Not an issue on the (presumably more powerful) 50"" model. Hulu is still a little slower than others to start up videos, particularly when starting from the TV off position, but not nearly as bad as when the camera was booting up in the background. Haven't had to restart since.Update after about 2 months: Both TVs are still working perfectly. Figured out that the Show uses its own display to show content when the TV is off (unless ""on Fire TV"" is tacked on to the command). Very happy with both of them. :)",7

Toshiba sent another one.  That one never worked.

Immediately Geek Squad came out - needed a chip ... replaced ... nope - did not fix it... reached out to Amazon &amp; Best Buy to return / replace it and was told - Nope its been longer than 30 days.  No exception complete disregard to look into the issues with their own tv.  Biggest mistake ever was getting this tv!  I have currently had a $400 tv that won't turn on and no means to resolve it.  If you still buy this tv - buy the warranty!  If I could put less then 1 star I would but it is not an option.,7
4.0,"Great price point for 4K UHD Dolby Vision... Still falls short in many ways.
  
","July 19, 2019",Yes,"I put this up side-by-side with a TCL Roku 50"" 4K UHD (no Dolby Vision) from Costco (Model 50S423). I actually like both screens, but the option of Dolby Vision on the Toshiba is nice. I also tend to use apps on Amazon Fire TV devices vs Roku, so having that built-in is a bonus for me. NOTE: I got this as a Prime Day deal, so the cost was only $10 more than the Roku -- Normal pricing is about $100 higher.Let's get this out of the way first: A recent Fire TV OS update allows you to set the TV to power on to the last input used. So if you primarily use an external box, like Comcast Xfinity or DirecTV, you can default to that when you turn on the TV. Furthermore, the TV does have HDMI-CEC. I use this with my Tivo Bolt and just push Live TV on my TiVo remote and the TV will power on and automatically switch to HDMI 2 full screen. Easy and nothing to balk at.The photo show the difference in remotes, with the TCL Roku on the left, the Toshiba Fire TV Edition (included) in the middle, and the newer Fire TV Remote w/Alexa Voice on the right. It's a larger remote for sure with some extra buttons. Unfortunately, the while it has an IR lense, the Fire TV OS in the Toshiba lacks the same functions that you would get with the voice remote on the right. Specifcially, if you are not using the HDMI ARC channel, you can't program the remote to control volume on older A/V receivers. The ""new"" Alexa Voice remote does this...unfortunately, that remote cannot be paired with this TV. Stupid, right? The idea was to ditch as many remotes as possible, but I'm still stuck with two if using Fire TV because I can't control the stereo volume that I currently patch with optical cable from TV to 5.1 stereo.Speaking of volume, ALEXA YELLS AT YOU. With a few exceptions, the volume of Alexa vs program volume is way off. I haven't found a setting that will turn her volume up or down, and unlike some Echo devices, you can't say ""Alexa Voice 5"" to change it independent of the program volume. You'll actually find complaints on this in the support forums.Despite having a 4-core CPU, it still has some lag when switching to various screens in Fire TV OS. Not much different experience than the regular Fire TV devices.Where this TV really shines is for OTA users. The new(ish) Live Guide is great for antenna input, and if you have Philo, Pluto, or PS Vue they will appear here too. They need a faster way to jump to a different source because scrolling through all the Pluto Channels to get to the Philo list takes forever. Some Amazon Channels show up here as well, though I was disappointed that apps that support live TV do not show their programming info in the guide yet. I expect it's coming, but of course have no expectations on ETA. Fingers crossed that YouTube TV will end up in the live guide.Color settings can be tweaked for EACH input, and they have 3 HDMI to work with. You'll get a subset of color functions with UHD and Dolby Vision content playback.Some other menu items that you'll find on Fire TV Stick devices are also missing on the TV. I do kinda wish that the TV offered CableCard connectivity to plug Xfinity directly into it and pull that content into the Live Guide, but I guess that's what my Tivo is for.There are some dark spots in the corners. The viewing angle isn't bad, but can look a little washed out the further away from center you get.Anything over 1080p looks sharp and solid. Sadly, I've noticed that most streaming services are highly compressed and even at 1080 they will result in gradient banding and halos. OTA SD content (sent over Xfinity cable) is really bad now. We're coming from a 42"" Samsung Plasma and while you knew a signal wasn't HD, it wasn't as obvious. The backlighting isn't as bright as most UHD Dolby Vision TVs, so that might hurt you if you need the extra bright. Unless I'm watching a dark program signal, I can usually have windows open without strong glares or reflections ruining things.No cable management in the back. Not even one of those fat rubberbands to guide wires down the middle. The feet are UGLY, so keep that in mind of you're not mounting it to a wall (we are still debating that in our house). The mount is 200x400 on the 50"" model, so keep that in mind too. I was thrown off because the Roku was 200x200 and only a few pounds lighter.BOTTOM LINE: If you're looking for a good entry Dolby Vision 4K UHD television, it's not a bad choice. If you're willing to spend an extra $300+ you might find something better, but really nothing under $500 that going to rock your world.The stars I've taken away are primarily the result of missing Fire TV OS functions that are found on the other Fire TV device line and/or remotes. I'd easily move the Smart Features and Alexa Integration up to 5 stars if they'd just add or fix them to the TV Edition OS.",5

The picture is great and the smart functionality is much better than my Sony 55” that cost a lot more. I really like how it merges the inputs (over the air antenna, PlayStation vue, etc.) into one “On Now” line where you just choose what to watch and the tv worries about which input it is behind the scenes. Voice control is decent and useful, but it does need some tweaks or upgrades. Ability to rewind and pause live tv off an antenna is great and I can’t do that on other TVs in the house that I paid more for. If these are on sale again for Black Friday I’ll convince myself I “need” another one.",7
3.0,"Great TV, But...
  
","December 4, 2018",Yes,"The TV arrived yesterday. It's lightweight, easy to set up and features a great picture and decent sound (especially when connected with a Bose speaker). Definitely a huge improvement over the 2010 Toshiba Plasma TV it replaced.So why only three stars? Several reasons:1) A few days after ordering it, I realized that a 50'' screen was probably too large for the space. So I tried to cancel the order and purchase the same model in 43''. Well, Amazon or BestBuy or whoever refused to allow me to do so, EVEN THOUGH THE TV HADN""T SHIPPED YET. In face, it wasn't set to ship for several more days. Instead, I was instructed via email, I'd have to bring the TV to a BestBuy or a UPS Center to get a refund. This seems like an unnecessary hassle for an item so big and expensive. I can understand not being able to cancel it AFTER it ships. But BEFORE?! That's B.S. (P.S. It turns out the 50'' just fits, so all's well that ends well.)2) The TV comes with three HDMI ports on the back, which is great. But they're in an incredibly stupid place -- all the way to the far left of the TV as you face it, and high up. WHY?! Most of us run our cables through a hole in the middle of our TV stand... a good two feet from these ports. Why not install the ports in the middle and lower down on the set? The cables are now visible to the room, and they shouldn't be. Plus, they're stretched to the max.3) There are almost no printed instructions for setting up the TV. I'm a fairly tech-savvy guy, and I was flummoxed for a while. Basically, you have to plug the thing in and wait for it to talk to you before you know what to do. (And be warned -- it takes a VERY long time to boot up at first.All in all, I'm sure I'll be happy with this purchase. Had it not been for the issues mentioned above, I'd have given the item five stars.",5

","July 14, 2019",Yes,"Update #2: Toshiba &amp; Amazon were both helpful with our problem, and eventually did locate the correct remote to pair with our tv.  I am frustrated knowing there was not an option to push a button on the side of the tv to set up the tv in case of a lost remote, but for now we are happy being able to use our tv again. Update #1: Big problem with the tv! If you lose the remote there is no way to use the tv if it is reset back to factory default or you get a new wifi network or password.  This is what we did, and now have a useless tv.  The Firetv app will not connect to the tv because it needs the wifi info.  There are no buttons on the tv that will allow this to be done manually.Origional review......We've had this tv for a year now.  We love our tv!!

","February 4, 2019",Yes,"I was so pleased with this TV for the price point that I bought 2 more, one for my father for Christmas and another for my bedroom. I bought two 55 inch and one 50 inch. So far, they all have worked flawlessly. I am hoping they will work great for years to come, time will tell on that one. I love the menu layout and especially the TV tuner software, wow that part alone is amazing. Once you tune in your over the air TV channels, it brings them into a nifty guide similar to your cable/satellite TV, all the while letting you pause, fast fw and rewind live TV, now that is great. Also let's you preview what's playing on TV channels, as well as prime and Netflix movies without actually selecting them. The voice function to be able to change the input jack in the back and rename the input was perfect to help my dad since he is technologically challenged. Very pleased with them so far.",5

","October 9, 2018",Yes,"The picture on this is awful. It cannot handle blacks or bright colors. It makes them blotchy and digital and terrible looking. I'm only giving this TV two stars instead of one because when the scene is well-lit, like most sporting events, for instance, it's a pretty good picture. But this TV kind of ruins movies by being unable to handle natural blacks (meaning dark or dimly lit scenes) and colors (I watched the new, neon-hued film, MANDY, on this thing and it just totally ruined the experience by giving that distorted, blotchy look to it all). And I'm a huge movie fan, so this is really bothersome. I was hoping I'd find a way to adjust the picture or whatever to fix the problem, but none of the calibrations I've done so far have had any affect at all. If I could, I'd send this back but I waited too long and missed Amazon's cutoff date. I'm going to look into contacting Toshiba to see what they'll do, but I have little faith that will come to any positive conclusion based on other reviewer's comments about dealing with their customer service. Oh well! Guess I'm just out $300+. Seriously, I had a slightly smaller, standard definition TV before this one that looks loads better. I've no idea how they can call this TV HD, let alone 4K, when it can't handle the basics, like blacks and bright colors. Don't buy. Take your money and put it toward a more expensive TV by a more trustworthy brand. I wish I'd done that, but I'll likely have to eat the money I put into this piece of junk.",5

5.0,"Incredible quality for such a nice low price...
  
","December 31, 2018",Yes,"We have electronics to drool over in our home, but I required a small unit for my craft room and HIGH quality was not my primary concern when selecting a tv.  I needed the right compact size and an affordable price with features of a smart tv.  This is now in place and in use and I have to say...I really appreciate all it brings.  It was packaged very well by the manufacturer, it was easy to set up with the included legs for table top installation, and I am not the technological whiz in our home, so the absolute plug and play set up was fabulous for me to set it up on my own - it only required a software update which it detected and completed on its own.  The picture is clear, the WiFi connection seems to be holding well.  If I had to take marks for anything it would be the sound quality, but I am in no way thinking of adding a sound bar simply due to the fact that it is in a 12' x 12' room that is a dedicated craft room - and I have not evaluated sound clarity at high volumes because high volumes are not necessary.  I am only using it for mindless ""tv"" watching while I am creating with my yarn and it is a huge upgrade from watching on my iPad.  I also have used the Alexa function to play music.  ""Alexa, play Norah Jones"" and there she goes, randomly streaming Norah Jones for me.  I really love the built in apps for all our internet subscriptions for media watching - you simply select the ones you desire to show on your ""home"" screen.  I am considering the purchase of additional units for our vacation residence.  We have one quality tv in the living room, but the attractive low price and the ease of use would make these great choices for auxiliary units in the bedrooms just in case someone wants to just chill on their own but not watch on a tablet.  Great choice for small spaces.  I have been using this for 2 weeks now so I cannot testify to longevity.  I expect this to last 3-5 years.  If for some reason it does not last longer than 6 months, I will update even though tv technologies will deem it obsolete by that time and it may not even be offered for sale by then.  I did purchase the 3 year maintenance warranty as insurance but it was no more than the cost of a latte so I did not feel it was a waste of money...hopefully I do not require it and then I can say it was the best waste of money.  I recommend, I would purchase again and I would give this as a gift.",4

","August 22, 2018",Yes,"For value I would give this TV 5 stars (I bought it in prime day sales though) but for actual quality it's very average although better than some competitors in this price range. The picture is ok but not great, the voice control is very poor unless using amazon prime video. It will not actually play anything on other apps and will merely bring you to the homepage, sometimes it will just flat out not work. It also doesn't really connect with the echo dot very well and customer support can not help you with this at all. I had to trawl through online blogs to find out how to do this properly despite being relatively simple. Overall, if you're looking for a cheapish tv this is pretty good but if expecting real ultra or great voice playback you'll have to spend a chunk more!",8

1.0,"Parental controls are nonexistent!
  
","July 23, 2019",Yes,"I purchased two of these for my kids so that I can do my homework in peace thinking that having two allowed them to watch Netflix and not fight over who watched the longest show, leaving me to get what I needed done in a reasonable amount of time. The thing that pisses me off the most about this t.v. is that there's a friggin' app store! I'm strict with screen time, and especially video games because my child would totally be that kid that forgot to eat or sleep and died playing video games (he's 7, we're working on it). There is absolutely NO way to block the apps/app store. You can make it so where you change the parental controls to require a password to open apps, but then you need a password to open Netflix. There's no way to pick and choose WHICH apps you want to have available, no option to remove unwanted features. It's a damn t.v.! It prevents app purchases and in-app purchases, but you can download the hell out of free apps (Like Crossy Road), and it's literally just a click of the remote. I already have the parental controls set for Netflix, so I felt fine about them having a t.v. in their rooms with netflix available to them. What's not okay is having an app store with games whose advertisements have absolutely no oversight on content. ""Is he cheating? Click here to choose what to do next?"" And it shows a woman (boobs) scarcely covered by a sheet in bed next to a man, while another woman stands over them holding up a bra. I don't want my kid to see that crap! I also don't want my kid to have unfettered access to all the free games in the app store (there's a lot of them that are extremely sexually suggestive, and others that are extremely violent). I choose my kid's games wisely, and I'm irritated that this television (not an ipad/phone) has apps in the first place and, more importantly, hasn't applied ANY parental control features to safeguard against undesired content. I can understand an app store so you can download Netflix, Hulu, etc., whatever, but to not have a control to the app store or in the app store after everything wanted has been downloaded is nuts. How about ALL downloads, regardless of free or for purchase, require a password? How difficult is that?!",3

Ugh!!  It's annoying because the setting should work!  What else will I discover that doesn't work as it's supposed to?!The sleep timer isn’t working either and very cumbersome to set. The remote has NO NUMBERS on it so you have to scroll thru channels which seems ridiculous to me.  No backlit remote.

(Thank you Michael!)Cons added:  The remote does not have numbers to select a channel easily like I'm used to.  You have to use the menu and scroll for your channel.  The remote is very different than what I'm used to so an adjustment period is necessary.  Also the ""sleep timer"" function is under settings (not a button on the remote) and not easy to use as most remotes.I don't like the opening to the fire screen as I use the over the air tv the most and only occasionally use the apps and prime tv.

Without a successful channel scan, the TV could not receive any of my Cable channels, so it was pretty useless to me. My old TV works just fine using the same coax connection.  I struggled with this off and on for 2 days and was never able to get it to work.  I reset the TV, rebooted the TV, swapped out coax cables, moved the TV to another coax being used successfully by another of my TV's - nothing worked.  I even took it out to my garage and connected it directly to my provider coax - nothing seemed to work. I disconnected the coax and tried to scan again.  Without the coax, the scan at least completed successfully but of course no channels could be found.  I connected the coax again and the channel scan again stopped at 3% and reset, starting the scan over again.

Mounted to my tv stand in the living room.Setup was pretty straightforward. Connected to my wifi network and it downloaded the software updates from amazon.I signed in with my amazon prime account and was able to navigate the menus with ease. If you had a fire stick prior to purchasing, the interface will be exactly the same with a few differences. But, if you had the fire stick the learning curve won’t be as challenging as for someone that has never used a fire tv interface. If you don’t have amazon prime, you may want to sign up now. I have read numerous complaints from non prime members that the TV constantly bombards you with ADS if your not a prime member.Product Documentation/included in box- there is literally NO documentation with this. Except for all the warnings about mounting it so children don’t knock it over. There is one small pamphlet in the box that gives the most BASIC of functions. Also included are feet (if not wall mounting) and the screws so you can secure the tv to a wall mount! I loved that Toshiba included these. It looks great on my TV stand in my living room. Hopefully in the future Toshiba will include a more detailed instruction booklet, perhaps. But to be fair, amazon updates the system frequently and different features are changed and or eliminated frequently, so the booklets would be out of date in no time.-Build quality I would give this TV a 7 out of 10 build quality rating. Corners are well defined, but it’s mostly a very hard plastic. Definitely indicates this is a budget TV.-Picture quality- I would say this is a 8 out of a 10. I am coming from a old 720p set. So, my review may not jive with someone that had a higher end LG or samsung. The colors look natural and well defined. A very nice upgrade from 720p. I actually went to the following site to help calibrate the picture.  https://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/toshiba/amazon-fire-tv-2018/settingsThere are tons of settings, way to many to get into in this review, but i used the above link and it really helped to get the best quality picture.It’s also worth noting that you should purchase a 4k high speed HDMI cable. Amazon has these for a reasonable price. Don’t buy at retail and pay 30.00 or more. Buy on amazon and save.Apparently, if you use a non high speed cable, you can have issues witth the display flickering and stuttering. My older amazonbasics high speed hdmi cable appears to be sufficent. But, only time will tell.Blu ray disc picture quality-a perfect 10! Rich, vibrant colors, and great skin tones. Nearly perfect as far as i can tell! Great sound and no hesitation.Directv picture quality-I would give this a 7 out of a 10. I believe that directv compresses the signal to save on bandwidth. It should be noted that I don’t have  the 4k package. My receiver is a few years old, but still functional and I am very hesitant to upgrade my equipment/and orswitch to a 4k package. I am hoping to cut my ties with them within the next year or so.0TA antenna-I have one of these mounted on a pole about 20 feet up. I can receive normally about 10-12 channels. I live in a rural area and there is repeater that is about 15 miles away, only problem is the repeater only re-broadcasts the signals in analog. There are about 3 to 4 digital channels that come in crystal clear. It’s worth noting if your receiving the signal in ANALOG you will NOT get program information on the guide. It will just say “UNAVAILABLE” this won’t be a issue if your in urban area, only rural areas.Interface experience- I am still learning the ropes with interface. The great thing about this TV is that the fire experience (based on android, but created by amazon) is built right into the set. No extra fire sticks or other things to clutter the back of the TV. Simply switch it on, and go to your favorite streaming service (netflix, hulu, playstation vue) whatever the case may be. If you currently don’t subscribe to cable or satellite, there is even LESS clutter behind the tv. But there are ample hdmi inputs. More on that later. The TV really hammers the point of “alexa” being able to control many aspects of the TV. while this is true, It can be cumbersome. For instance I will say “ALEXA, turn ON directv” and you would think alexa would just do it. But, she says “did you mean directv?” I reply “YES” then she sends the command to the directv receiver to turn on. The interface, to give it credit is pretty intuitive and easy to use. But, if you are a newcomer to the amazon fire tv platform and have no experience with previous fire sticks, etc.. you should read up and watch youtube videos to make sure you are a little familiar with the interface BEFORE buying this TV.Sound Quality-since getting my first HDTV back in 2014, I have always purchased one that had a headphone jack. I have a very nice set of logitech computer speakers with a subwoofer. The quality of speakers in these TV’s is marginal at best, given the very small and slim cabinet size.I really can’t give you a honest review on the actual sound quality..because i have issues with one my ears, and have lost around 50 percent of my hearing in that ear. It’s loud enough for me when connected to the speakers, but once again, I don’t feel comfortable giving it any kind of rating due to my medical issue with my ear.Remote control-  The included remote is very easy to hold in your hand. It’s basically a fire stick remote with voice search and some dedicated shortcut keys. All the buttons are layed out in a straightforward fashion. You can purchase a sleeve to go around the remote. I will be ordering one soon. The remote is rounded and slides very easy on your chair or end table next to your couch. Middle way down the remote is a small TV icon. That is the button you press to access the guide for OTA antenna (if you have one). The remote comes with 2 AAA batteries.It’s worth noting that by default, the tv will turn on to the HOME SCREEN. If you prefer, you can change this to the last input that you were using in the settings of the TV. I have read other reviews complaining about the TV defaulting to the home screen. And actually, another reviewer pointed this out to me. (i did extensive research prior to buying this TV).Inputs- Toshiba didn’t skimp on inputs. This tv has the following inputs on the back of the TV.1 USB Port-can plug in flash drive or hub to operate keyboards, mice etc.3 hdmi ports- for connecting  blu ray players, cable boxes, ETC.1 headphone jack1 optical out port-for connecting to surround sound.1 Lan port-if you want to connect tv directly to router.1 Antenna in- to connect OTA antenna.1 RCA composite cable connectors-if you have anything older you want to connect. For example, a VCR.Toshiba was very generous with all these ports. Even though this TV was intended for cord cutters, it’s very nice to still include all of these ports for us that are still on the fence about finally getting rid of our ridiculous cable or satellite providers.Here is the nutshell version of my reviewPROS--loved the attractive price.-4k but haven’t really watched anything in true 4k format yet.-amazon fire tv built in-beautiful picture-voice search built into remoteCons--alexa commands are slow and sometimes hard to use (keep in mind you need to have amazon echo or dot close by)-the guide for OTA doesn’t show program information if the signals are in analog-NO signal strength indicator for OTA channels-replacement remotes not readily available (have to get from toshiba)-if the software in the TV fails, looks like i will be stuck with a 18 pound living room wall ornament (the software has to boot the TV up so i could change the input and use a fire stick if the interface failed)I was a little nervous buying this tv honestly. I have noticed mixed reviews on here and other sites, but for the price i decided to take the plunge. If your upgrading from a older set say 720p, the difference in the picture is night and day. Now, if your coming from a samsung, LG, or other high end set, you may be disappointed. This TV is budget priced. And for the price i paid (199.00) it was a deal. Give it a shot, you don’t have anything to lose.",3

Samsung and the other companies are always just rated average for viewing angle.I also view this at the same exact angle so its fine for meI would NOT use this set in a room where people are sitting in different places.

5.0,"Nice for the price
  
","February 16, 2019",Yes,"This TV is a smart which means it has the ability to get services such as Netflix, Hulu and Pandora directly without any piece of hardware required. Because it is geared to streaming I found it a bit quirky to use . . .  at first. This TV is not like a more traditional unit. Even the Over The Air (OTA) channels are accessed in the typical guide format used with streaming devices. In this case, Fire TV. The remote, for instance, does not have channel up and down buttons as you are expected to get around using the guide. For those that like the more traditional channel up and channel down, this set might not be your bag. After my initial discomfort, however, I got used to the guide-like interface for OTA channels. The trick is to hit the down key on the multi-directional pad and than scroll left or right to find the desired channel which is named instead of numbered such as, for example, Fox instead of channel 5.1. Quirky-ness aside, it is a fine TV. Picture is sharp and crisp. Please note the inputs are USB (1), HDMI (3) and Composite (1). I do wish they had included a component input (RGB+L&amp;R) and a VGA port. VGA ports are quickly becoming the DoDo birds of graphics ports but it is still a nice interface to have. Not a killer for me though. I just got a component to HDMI converter from here on Amazon for 20 bucks and swapped out my graphics card on the PC to get an HDMI output port. All is well in TV Land. Verdict: For the size and quality of the set it is well worth the price.",4

","February 2, 2019",Yes,"Bought this Toshiba TV on Dec 1st based off of positive product reviews.  TV worked great for 6 weeks.  One day we turned it on and a black screen with the words ""FireTV"" showed with a loading symbol.  No matter how long we waited this screen never moved.  Called Toshiba Customer Service.  They had me turn the TV on/off, unplug the tv, try holding down buttons on the remote...nothing worked.  After 30 minutes on the phone with Toshiba, they asked me to take it to Best Buy (the shipper) to have the Geek Squad look at it.  Arrived at Best Buy, they tried all the same trouble shooting techniques with the same result.  Concluded that their was no fix and refunded my money back to my card right there at the store.  I asked the guy helping me at Best Buy what I should replace with, since I won't be buying another Toshiba.  He recommended a Samsung TV.  The best part about this situation was that the item came from Best Buy and they provided excellent Customer Service.After reading reviews since my Dec 1st purchase, it sounds like Toshiba TVs manufactured mid 2018 - current are having issues.  This one was manufactured August 2018.  I even purchased the Asurion Extended Warranty offered by Amazon at time of purchase.  This warranty was useless.  When I filled out a claim request from the Asurion website, it told me to contact the manufacturer.  I've requested a warranty refund.Don't waste your money or time on either of these products.",3

","October 7, 2018",Yes,"this TV checks off everything to be one of the best value TVs out there. The picture quality is great and 4K is nice for future proofing even if there isn't a whole lot of native 4k content out there right now. The main reason I bought this is for gaming. Doing some research I found that this TV has one of the lowest latency panels, and I am happy to report that I feel no lag when playing xbox, playstation, or Nintendo switch.The thing that really drags this TV downt though, Id say it is the only negative of this TV, is the sound quality. Put simply, it absolutely sucks. I have the volume on 8/100 and some sounds are ear shattering, while others I can barely hear. I have tried adjusting the individual sound settings, but it only marginally helped.That being said, pair this TV with a sound bar or some external speakers, even cheap $150 dollar ones, and this is an winning combo.",4

","October 26, 2018",Yes,"I bought this device on Prime Day 2018 for a very very good price.For a 4K TV is it excellent at its price, but its not without issues.Picture quality is pretty decent. The sound is mediocre. The device frequently resets the sound settings. You can set it to Movie and it will change Bass and Treble to -12, then the next day they'll both be at 0. You set it back to Movie and this time it sets Bass to 0 and Treble to -12. Very buggy. This can be fixed with an update Toshiba. Please do.The worst AND best part is the Fire TV aspect. It's great that it's prebuilt in but they cheaped out on it. There's not enough space for applications so you might have to resort to a USB drive (and it's implementation is poor). The interface and remote issues appear to have been improved significantly.One big bug I've noticed is that the device seems to run out of memory or something. If you watch a show on one app, say Plex, then switch to another app the sound will be out of sync for the video. It doesn't matter which app, this happens on almost all of them when the bug occurs. You have to restart the TV.If you want a 50"" 4K for a great price, this is a good choice. BUT if the only reason you're purchasing this is because Amazon Fire is built in, then it might not be. You'd be better off with a different 4K TV and a 4K Fire Device that you plug in separately.",3

The low rating is because some of the apps require a game system style controller to play them. I went to Amazon.com to purchase a couple for my kids and was amazed to find out that they make controllers for the fire sticks, but not the 4k fire television. So now I have a tv with tons of apps and games that my kids want to play, and they can't because Amazon sold me a product that requires a device that they don't even make or have available.

","November 28, 2019",Yes,"Audio and Video do NOT sync with this TV when used with external receivers.  I have used both HDMI direct from ARC HDMI input and have used Optical connectors.  Depending on which 'visual enhancements' are activated for display (or sources), the audio either lags or is advance of the picture.  I'll estimate 200-300 ms,  But I cannot get it to be 'in sync'.  If the TV speakers are used instead, then it is in sync.  There are no option on this tv for a user selectable time adjustment (delay/advance) for the sound.  There are numerous complaints about audio visual sync for 'fire tv' which you can also find online.  This TV was purchased for a home theatre system, it's worthless in that regard because the audio and video are just enough out of sync to make any action movie unbearable.

Now ALL I have to do with my Fire remote is go to HDMI 1, click it and I'm back to regular cable TV.

","September 25, 2019",Yes,"Worked great for about 6 weeks after I got it on a Prime Day sale for too-good-to-pass-up deal; unfortunately, about 3 weeks ago, it quit booting all the way up, and one of the symptoms is that the only button on the remote that it will respond to is the ""Power"" button.After searching for this issue, there are a ton of reports in the user forums for Best Buy. Since the TV quit outside both the Best Buy and Amazon return windows, I will have to deal with Toshiba; I bought the 32 inch model, so they will not make a housecall for that small a TV, which means I have to take it in - which requires packing it into packaging equivalent to the original packing. I live in an apartment - I only kept the box for 2 weeks before pitching it.Amazon/Best Buy/Toshiba need to either figure out what the issue is with these TVs or quit selling them. I know that TVs are basically considered a ""Throw away and replace"" item now - but they should last longer than 6 weeks. It's too bad, because I liked this little TV before it quit working/responding to the remote.Edit: After spending some time on the phone with Toshiba support, the fix was to reset the remote: Simultaneously press and hold the Menu button (3 horizontal lines), the back button, and the left side of the select ring for 20 seconds, all while pointing the remote at the TV.Apparently, this works most of the time (it DID reset the remote); sometimes, the TV also requires resetting (as mine did): Unplug the TV and hold the power button for about 1 minute. Then plug it back in and release the power button as soon as the 1st splash screen shows up. Select the option to clear all settings/memory (sorry - don't remember the exact wording on that selection), and after all settings are cleared, select reboot.

Fortunately the smudge mark easily came off.-The remote control that comes with the TV is one of those overly simplistic fire TV remotes.

(this doesn't affect me since I'm a prime member)Now the positives....-The visual quality is excellent and significantly better than my older LG TV which this replaced. The colors are vivid, bright and crystal clear.

It was AWESOME, until the screen went black after less than 2 months and then it wasn't😞 I even bought the asurion warranty to cover my bases. Didn't help one iota because that does not kick in until one FULL year. I spent hours on the phone listening to musak talking to Toshiba reps in Mexico (true story, I asked) As of this date I am waiting on a visit by the Geeksquad ""expert"" to come to my home to either fix it (probably not) or set me onto the next step in this journey. Bear in mind, the BEST outcome for me is that I will get some sort of amazon/bestbuy credit when I would rather get the $ I actually paid. Also, I chose to have my tv delivered because I live alone, am a senior citizen &amp; just had abdominal surgery. I have a feeling I am going to have to lug this contraption into a bestbuy which is kindof far from my home to even get a refund. Stay tuned.. Further ongoing saga UPDATE: Been on the phone more times than I can count for 3-4 hours all together. Bounced from Amazon to Toshiba to Bestbuy to Geeksquad rep who actually came to my home who referred me to my local Bestbuy brick &amp; mortor store who referred me back to Toshiba!

","December 2, 2019",Yes,"Bought the 32"" 720P to replace an old Sony analog bedroom TV that lives inside an armoire.  Unfortunately, dimensions were such that I could not quite fit the 43"" model, so I had to settle for 720P instead of 1080P.That being said, it was a huge step up from the old 480i analog TV :)I bought this last July, but I wanted to burn it in before I tried rating it.PROS:1.  price.  price.  Did I say ""price""?  For most purposes, it's a great TV so far.2.  Wifi connectivity is good. I consistently get North of 100mbs download speeds, so now issues there.  No drops that aren't caused by my ISP :)CONS:1.  Ocassionally--not often, this happened twice I think--if I let it sit idle and it goes into screensaver mode, I lose my HDMI signal.  Once this was fixed simply by changing the channel on my cable box.  The last time it happened, I had to go into settings and reboot the TV.2. Limited internal storage.  The TV has 8GB internal storage, but it only has 4GB available for aps out-of-the-box.  You can format a USB drive of 128GB or less (I did 64GB) FAT32 with quick format, and then the TV will ask you if you want to format it for internal use when you select the USB from internal.  This will expand the storage you have available for aps.The other uses. however, for the USB (pictures, files, or being able to pause live-stream video for hours instead of 5 minutes or less) requires the USB to be formatted for external use, so that's a bother.  You only have one USB port, so you'd have to eject the one you are using for internal app storage if you did that, and insert another USB dongle to support that.  Also, with that near infinite pause, you might want to make sure you have a USB dongle with a good write speed (Samsung).3.  I paired this with the Toshiba soundbar/wireless subwoofer through ARC, and even on the news setting for the soundbar, it's a little too much bass, kind of muddy.  Dialog gets lost at lower volumes, though without the soundbar/subwoofer and using only the TV's built-in speakers, this was fine.  Also, I wound up placing the wireless subwoofer right behind the TV because otherwise there was a noticeable and distracting latency.  So not sure if it's the soundbar/subwoofer or the TV not playing especially well with the sound upgrade.Summary: for 100 bucks, it's a great upgrade to an ancient 480i Sony Trinitron I bought in 1997.  If it lasts half as long as the Sony, it will have been an awesome buy.There is room for improvement with internal storage for aps, or at least a 2nd USB for the external storage.  The bug that requires rebooting the thing hasn't happened enough to be annoying so far.",2

The Toshiba Fire TV was on my short list, so.I was optimistic about what it had to offer. When I first took it out of the box and plugged it in, there was a standard wait time for the TV firmware to update. It took probably 30 minutes, but eventually the set-up process started. Right after completing set up, I installed Hulu and Sling. I use Sling to stream live TV, but I wanted to try Hulu. Both apps are incredibly sluggish on this TV. The only way I could navigate around either app is through Alexa voice commands. Netflix worked well.In general the TV interface is sluggish and it is constantly pointing you towards Amazon media and general advertisements. On the pause screen, they serve a Coca Cola ad; the app switcher is bisected by ads for the most recent Amazon production. I just wanted a simple TV without all of this bloatware. I guess I should have known that when I bought a Fire TV, but I expected a more polished experience. I’ll definitely be plugging in an Apple TV and forget about this sorry interface.",2

To fix requires factory reset which is no big deal to do once but after a week problem returns. Do factory reset more than once and you want to throw tv out the window. Reset is extremely poor design since must hold power button on tv and plug in at same time BUT power button and plug are too far apart so must either get someone to help or go find an extension cord. Then must re-enter all your login for internet, Netflix, etc. Makes a smart tv seem like dumb tv.Even worse I called in to report problem shortly after purchase and tech said do this and problem would be solved which it was until it returned. Then I asked for refund instead BUT thay said nosince it was after 30 days EVEN though it was a problem I called in about early on and they assured me problem was fixed. It is a problem that Toshiba knows about can find many others having similar problem on internet forums. Toshiba and other folks say to re-pair remote or do factory reset but they rarely mention how problem eventually returns and how frustrating it is each time. Save yourself the frustration of doing factoiry resets and do not buy this tv.

","December 9, 2018",Yes,"I wanted a larger TV for my shop.  After getting everything set up, new articulating TV mount near the ceiling, up and down the ladder many times, I powered up the TV with the antenna and a hardwired Ethernet connection.  I spent two hours trying to get the TV to initialize.  It didn't like my hardwired connection (probably because there was is an additional Netgear swich downline from my router).  It would get part way with the software update download and then vomit.  Sometimes it would randomly switch to another section of the initialization routine. I tried to initialize a WiFi link but could never get through entering the wireless access point password.  4 or 5 letters entered and it would go off in la-la land. The initialization routine was constantly locking up.  It would not 'remember' my Amazon log in credentials so I was entering them over and over again.  It would fail to send the 6 digit authentication code to my phone.  After two hours of trying, I went up the ladder, disconnected it, hauled it into my office and did the initialization from there.  Note 802.11 allows up to 5 switches in series before the latency spec is exceeded.  I have one extra switch.  The port statistics show ZERO dropped packets / CRC error packets.  This points to sloppy software in the TV.After getting everything initialized in my office, back to the shop, up the ladder and remounted &amp; reconnected the TV.Finally I could scan the channels from my TV.  I had to rescan 4 times before I could finally access live TV channels.At this point, I've got the new TV with enet from the same switch and the antenna from the same splitter as the ""old"" TV with an Amazon Fire adapter, both tuned to the same station.  The New TV keep losing the enet connection soAlexa wouldn't work.  But worse, both TVs are playing the same TV station and the new TV is dropping out (weak signal) constantly.  Toshiba has clearly scrimped on the tuner sub assembly.  Maybe they figure everybody has cable TV these days - but I don't.  I have 3 TVs presently running off my antenna and they work just fine.This TV was a huge disappointment.  I briefly compared the picture quality with my old TV.  Rendering was highly pixelated and the color seemed slightly distorted.This TV might be adequate if your enet cable is 10' to 15' from your router and you have cable TV with a strong signal.

1.0,"Ridiculous joke of a “smart” TV
  
","December 12, 2018",Yes,"Wow... I totally fell for this cheap excuse for a television.  I’m angry yet I also acknowledge that you get what you pay for... So here is my issues:The largest frustration that I discovered right after I threw out the box is that it won’t play anything on an external hardrive!!!  That’s right, IT DOES NOT READ VIDEOS THROUGH THE USB PORT.  I have owned many televisions over the past decade and they have all played my movies on my external hard drive.  And it isn’t the formatting either.  I have 3 external hard drives full of my movies, all of them are formatted for PCs and/or Macs.  Absolutely ridiculous.Then there’s the fact that it treats all the apps differently.  Clearly Amazon is not a fan of Netflix.  It’s impossible to get the channel to work.There is often a delay in the remote which is incredibly annoying especially when trying to adjust the volume.I’ve only had the TV for a little over a week and I absolutely hate it.  I feel stupid for making this purchase and not doing enough research.  It was a impulsive cyber Monday type purchase that I shouldnt have made.Don’t buy this television unless you only plan on watching amazon prime.  Even the HBO barely works.  This suuuuuuucks!!!!Update: 5/18/19Just when I thought I couldn’t hate this TV anymore, it decides to make watching anything on HULU impossible.  I’ve tried re installing the app, searching for updates and everything else, but nothing works.  It’s the only app that freezes and then kicks you out and sends you back to the main menu.  It is completely frustrating and impossible to watch anything on Hulu.  It’s been doing this for a week now and there’s nothing I can do.  I imagine the TV wants you to watch Prime and nothing else, but the Prime app is atrocious.  It is the least user friendly app and it’s so difficult to navigate through.  I truly hate this television with every fiber of my being.  I want to go “Office Space” on this TV and take it out in a field and beat it &amp; break it into a million pieces!  Save yourself the headache and DONT BUY THIS TELEVISION, it’s pure garbage!!!",2
2.0,"Soundbar connection flaw.
  
","December 1, 2019",Yes,"Thought our sound bar was messed up, so we bought a new one and found out apparently this TV just has a couple weird flaws. It has, ever since we bought it, been turning on the soundbar somehow, as it the TV was sending a signal that it was just turned on also, even when it's not on. This will occur often and can really be kinda creepy in the middle of the night. But that part we could get over, it was the other flaw that makes me kinda nervous about still using this TV. Apparently, if you pause whatever you're watching, our TV will forget how to sound. As soon as you start playing the show or movie you're watching again, the sound starts rapidly increasing, and not being able to be turned down until it hits it's max volume, makes a loud pop, then goes down to quiet and comes back up to the volume you had it originally at. Not sure how bad this is for the soundbar, but it does make me quite nervous that my soundbar's quality is going to drop significantly.Honestly.... I probably don't recommend this TV. Not with issues like this.",3

4.0,"HDMI Version Output MUST be set manually
  
","November 17, 2018",Yes,"The TV works fine enough, but there is a setting you might want to be aware of.  I usually connect my laptop to my TV and use the TV as a display.  Initially, there was no problem then after about a day, the TV started flickering, horizontal lines started appearing during the flickering, and and very loud crackling and popping sounds would come from the TV periodically.  It even made those loud sounds and the TV spontaneously shut down.  I thought the TV had burned out, but it hadn't.  I started troubleshooting and thought I had narrowed it down to the HDMI output on my laptop cause when I put the TV in its app mode the problem completely went away, but when putting it into the HDMI input mode from my laptop the problem started again immediately.  I purchased a device to bypass the HDMI port from my laptop to do the job with some hardware and software trickery.  While waiting for the part I kept trying things on the TV and then found the setting Picture &gt;&gt; Advanced Settings &gt;&gt; HDMI Input Mode.  There are two modes in this submenu:  Mode 1 (1.4) and Mode 2 (2.0).  By default it is set on Mode 2 (2.0).  I did some spec hunting on the output of my 'high end gaming laptop' and its HDMI output is HDMI 1.4.  I changed the setting to Mode 1 (1.4) and the problem completely went away.Yeah!  Problems solved, right?  Not quite.  All was going well for a day or so when the TV prompted it was going to update its firmware if I didn't delay it from doing so at that moment choosing the delay prompt.  I thought there would be no harm so I allowed the update.  The popping, crackling, and shutdown started immediately upon the TV restarting.  Fortunately, I knew exactly where to go in the TV's settings to change it to Mode 1 (1.4).  I would imagine that other devices may have similar syncing and timing problems with the setting.So there are two problems here:1.  The TV does not auto-detect if your device is outputting at HDMI 1.4 or 2.0.  This was obviously causing a timing and syncing problem between my TV and my laptop's HDMI output.  And since it is set to 2.0 by default, I didn't know this was an issue.  You are benefiting from the many days I spent of trial and error and finally nailing it down to this problem stated.  I cannot image that I am the only one who has had this problem.  But the behavior is so bad, I think most folks likely experiencing this problem may think that their TV is defective.  Solution here could be to state up front in the instructions about this obscure setting or to take care of the setting through auto-detection if the detection can be accomplished through a firmware update.  I'm certain more than a few TVs have been returned for this unknown quirk.2.  The user has NO control over the TV prompting to update.  You can either choose to allow the update immediately or delay the update.  There is no 'turn updates off' function.  And when it does update, the aforementioned setting WILL set back to the default of Mode 2 (2.0).  You can only avoid this forced updating if you never leave your TV unattended when it is powered on.  Fortunately, you now know how to change the setting if you have the same problem.  This issue can definitely be addressed with a firmware update.Conclusion:  Great TV with some flawed firmware issues.",2

I didn't buy this TV for the Alexa feature, but it's a really nice bonus.  Another cool bonus is that you can play on the television lots of video games from Amazon that you can also play on the kindle.  My kids love this--a little too much.

It still worked ok, but it had a faint line going through the picture (an area where the pixels didn't work), and it wasn't a smart TV at all. I just needed a more updated, 32"" TV for my bedroom, but it wasn't an absolute necessity where my budget was concerned. But, I saw this TV for a great price on Prime Day, and decided to buy it. I am so PLEASED and HAPPY that I did! It's absolutely perfect for my needs and now I can get Netflix and Fire TV in my bedroom, which weren't such a common thing back in 2012!The picture is great and in settings, you can set the home screen to show either the Fire TV screen or to default to the last input that you watched, which is perfect because I still frequently watch shows that I recorded on my DVR through my cable provider. Perhaps the only thing that took a bit of going back and forth to set up was the picture quality/settings for my HDMI cable input (the picture settings are on the Fire TV screen and then it takes you to the HDMI input you want to adjust, but if you hit play or pause on your HDMI input, it takes you out of the settings options, so you have to go back to the Fire TV screen and do it again). However, this wasn't totally a big to-do, because once I did have the picture set to my preferences for my HDMI input, it was done--I only had to do that one time and the settings are good to go for everything I watch on my cable TV HDMI input.And, of course it is fantastic to have all of the Fire TV apps available to download and watch on the TV in my bedroom. Alexa words great, even though I tend to just let my fingers do the talking with the remote and don't use Alexa all that much. Either way, it is there to use for those who prefer it.

","September 18, 2019",Yes,"The Dolby Vision is just average on this TV, TCL actually performs better in this price range with there Roku TVs on HDR and Dolby Vision content,  but this is an overall very good picture at this price point. The biggest problem is the HDMI ARC connection just won’t work properly therefore if you plan on connecting a soundbar that requires it, for instance to playback Dolby Atmos, DTS-HD Master Audio, Dolby TrueHD, or do 4K pass-through, forget it. It will be bringing up the volume control display every minute or so and the audio will even dropout periodically. I have tried three sound bars from two different brands, Anker and Yamaha, and they both had the same issue. Most concerning is that Toshiba and Best Buy both refuse to take responsibility for this issue, trying first to lay it off as the responsibility of the speaker manufacturer having an incompatibility then straight up telling me they won’t even generate a replacement or repair order for ARC because it is unreliable, so it’s the fault of the technology they’re claiming, not their fault. When I asked the guy they sent out to my house what all the other people who use sound bars w/ HDMI do, he told me “use optical”. I informed him you can pass Atmos and DTS-HD over optical and the previous soundbar I had attached had 4K pass-through and Atmos, so how was I supposed to use it? He shrugged. On that note, STAY AWAY if you plan on using the HDMI ARC, sound bar or anything like that. Period.",1

","January 16, 2019",Yes,"I like the TV.  I'm an Amazon Prime member and have Prime Video, so I like how there's easy access to my Prime Video account via the TV ... Prime Video is the home screen.  Generally speaking, Alexa works the TV.  The remote control is small, and there aren't a lot of buttons to push on it ... because the idea is to use Alexa for the commands and telling the TV what you want. I'll admit I'm a little weary about ""Alexa"" ... ""Echo"" ... all those type of technology things that can listen to your voice and identify you and know what you're talking about.  I didn't know that the TV had ""Alexa"" capabilities when I bought it as I didn't (and still don't) want those type of devices in my home - because for me it's a privacy issue. As technology advances, so does the capability for hackers to gain access to those type of devices, hack them and get your private information. But - now that I have ""Alexa"" through default, I like it.  I still have no plans on getting a stand alone ""Alexa"" or ""Echo"" or anything like it, because I still think it's an infraction on one's privacy ... but I do admit that having an ""Alexa"" capable TV and what it can do is pretty cool.3/2 Update:  So, having this TV for a little bit now - I will say that it's ""kind of glitchy"".  I think that's in part because this TV has internet capabilities.  If one wants to use some of the features of this TV, one will have to connect it to the WI-FI - and as we all know the internet can be glitchy.  The other day it wouldn't connect to my network at all, and thus, some of the features wouldn't work.  It took a little while for me to figure out what was wrong - and I figured that I'd try and ""reboot it"" - like one does a computer - and - VOILA! Problem solved.  So, keep that in mind.  There may be times when one will have to treat this TV like a computer.As I said earlier, I'm not really ""crazy"" about Alexa - as overall I don't trust it, but - Alexa really hasn't been the problem with the glitchy'ness per se. Television makers try so hard to keep up technologically and make all these ""smart tv's"". Well, instead of trying to make them so ""smart"", why don't they try to make them ""less glitchy"".

","May 25, 2019",Yes,"I purchased this TV as part of Cyber Monday sale and the price for the 55-inch was less than that of even other budget 50"" models. I wanted a 55"" Smart TV for our basement, which is a 700 sq ft area split between a home gym and a recording/practice studio. I chose the Fire TV platform, in part, because it was supposed to be able to ""cast"" from the Peloton bike. While I was not able to make this happen, Peloton Digital works very well in the Silk web browser, and there are multiple 3rd party apps in the Amazon app store that allows the streaming via Apple AirPlay. A native Fire TV Peloton app is supposedly coming at some point in 2019.The voice control via the remote works very well, although I set up an extra Echo Dot and control it that way most of the time. The app ecosystem is good to the point where I rarely even use the cable box. It's very easy to set it to start with the cable input instead of the app home screen. Some folks seem to mind that Amazon features a lot of their own content, but as a Prime Video and Amazon Music user, I don't really mind. Plus its easy enough to customize your app layout.The picture is good, not great. This is a 4k edge-lit LED panel with HDR seems to have some quality consistency issues with many other reporting bright spots or frozen pixels. I'm happy to report that my particular panel is flawless with absolutely no bad pixels and a surprising level of backlight uniformity. The picture was serviceable out of the box, but I calibrated it using the THX calibration on a Blu-Ray disc, then punched up the color saturation, contrast, and brightness just a touch to optimize the picture for the room. The picture is light-years better than the 9-year-old Vizio it replaced, but not a good as the local-dimming Vizio M-Series in our living room, which has an exceptional picture for the price.HDR does make a difference, as some of the Netflix programming is available in 4K with HDR and that dramatically improves the contrast levels this set is capable of displaying.Overall, for this price, I think this is an idea second or third TV. For your primary set, I'd spend a little more and get something like a TCL 6-series or a Vizio M, but for a bedroom, office, or basement TV, you won't go wrong here. I'm a huge Roku OS fan, but the Fire TV OS is right up there.

Every time you turn it on it goes straight the Amazon Fire smart menu instead of playing television despite turning on the feature to override this. This means that you always have to have the TV remote with you and the Cable remote too. You cannot even get to watching cable TV without having the TV remote. So, if you lose or misplace the TV remote your TV is in turn totally worthless. I’m on the fence of whether I regret this purchase or not as opposed to buying something more traditional. I have never once used the “Alex features” and never will. But, again I enjoy the speakers, picture and look of the TV.",2
5.0,"Absolutely amazing for the price!
  
","February 14, 2019",Yes,"This review is specific to the 55"" model.I have only one complaint about this TV and want to get it out of the way first.  Buying a Fire TV gives EVERY person who uses it FULL ACCESS to your amazon account.  This includes product suggestions based off your shopping history, and the ability to make purchases on your credit/debit card.  I would be happier if the TV turned on with a profile selection like Netflix does when you launch the app.I was concerned after reading other reviews for the Toshiba Fire TV; however I do not think they are all for this model as Amazon is well known for ""fluffing"" the reviews on a product by using other product reviews.Things I found different in my experience than other reviewers stated:1. I can easily view the display without color distortion at 177 degrees or so, it is clean, clear, and no distortion or color changing at sharp angles.2. The sound is fantastic, I normally watch this TV between 8 and 16 depending on the noise level around me (open living/dining room AND kitchen, plus I have small kids and a wife in the house, with no other common space in the home besides these rooms).  My kids watch their shows between volume 4 and 7, again, unless the ambient noise is too high.  I returned my sound bar as it popped and clicked, I then took a 23 year old Sony 1100Watt Receiver out and connected 650W of speakers (no subwoofer) to the TV via Optical cable; however we almost never use the receiver, the sound is good enough as is.  I have the TV catercornered, so the speakers are not close to the wall (they are down firing to the best of my knowledge).  I have never had any issue understanding voices at ANY volume level from 4-26 on the TV (plus I love being able to say ""Alexa set my fire TV volume to 12"" and it does it!)3. The TV arrived in the box you would expect to see it in at Best Buy (note that Best Buy has their logo on the product sticker on the back of the TV, where the Serial Number and FCC ID are located), it arrived in the rain and sat on my front porch (in the rain, not protected) for about 8 hours before I became aware of it (I was asleep, I work nights and everyone else was away for several days).  The water while completely covering the exterior of the box did NOT get inside at all.  The TV was wrapped in a thin foam ""blanket"" that should have protected it even if water did get in.  The box was easy to remove and the TV is light enough for one person to lift (a good 10-15 pounds lighter than the 40"" I replaced with this 55"").4. I have had no issues with screen defects and have been using the TV since about 6 days after Black Friday 2018 (almost 90 days now), as much as 20 hours in a day.  I have watched 4k content, 1080p content, and even 720p content on it, all looked good (although the 720p, from youtube, was a good bit blocky and I don't intend on doing that again!  I do not know if it was upscaling and at the time I did not check to see if it was or could)To be honest, I have not used the built in Alexa since day 2, which was simply to show my wife it actually was there.  I have an Echo sitting next to the TV and simply tell it to manage the TV for me, all commands work, even watching a show in the Netflix app will launch from Alexa, even if the TV is turned off.  I have recommended this TV several times at this point and will continue to do so.  I am expecting a good sale price on it for Prime day and quite possibly will be ordering another in the future (but not likely this year).I hope Amazon works to make the overall experience better (profiles for the love Hawking!)",1

","January 1, 2019",Yes,"This it is full of disappointment. the interface is just horrible. You have to go to a menu to do anything on this T.V. Every app on this ""fire edition"" that is free is just a sample app. (at least every one I have tried out) The remote does not have a channel up/down selector on it so you have to pick from a menu to select a channel. You can use your voice to have ""Alexa"" change channels, however on broadcast T.V. Alexa can't do, say, 11.2 for the channel. So back to the menu you go to scroll through all the digital broadcast channels to find the station you want. NO channel selector on a tv remote? WHAT? BAD engineer no biscuit! I wanted to see my photographs on a larger screen than my computer, so I was hoping to use this! Think again! 1st thing you have to do is try to research what app will read a simple JPEG file ( the file used to show a digital photograph) then scroll through 100's of apps that are not listed alphabetically or in any order for that matter. And to top it off there is NO SEARCH function for apps! So once again you are stuck scrolling through endless lists of useless apps that have nothing to do with what you are looking for.

It looks once and if it can't see the PC input it gives up and you have to use the remote once the computer boots. Meanwhile, you are forced to stare at some fake model family screensaver. I don't like the way it manages the appearance settings. Can't just blank out the screen with a powersaver mode and listen to audio in the dark, like you can on LG. Less than one percent of the content is available in 4K, and older computers can't match its display type (1080 p v. 4k.) The internet slot is mounted backwards (should be plug outside, not in.)Data hog, reverted to basic setup within two weeks. Tried all the free stuff: Netflix, Prime, Hulu, Boomerang, AMC, Newsy, etc. Ran out of watchable content in a week.Disappointed in how it isn't good for Amazon shopping compared to Fire tablet or a PC or phone. Might have some potential as an Amazon Camera monitor or security system, but Alexa doesn't understand much, and I 'm not going to train her how to do her job. Games are fun, but you need a real controller and the one I ordered didn't work, so I gave up on that.Decent packaging, easy setup.

","October 10, 2019",Yes,"This has been BY FAR the worst customer service experience I have ever had. Will never buy through Best Buy again and definitely will never purchase another Toshiba product EVER.Last month my Toshiba tv started having issues (see attached photos). The screen would be white/grey when turned on and non responsive. The remote wouldn’t do anything besides turn the TV off and on. Tried resetting the TV many times, researching online, and no solution.I finally decide to call Amazon and they tell me to call Best Buy. Best Buy tells me to call Toshiba. Toshiba sets up an appointment with guess who... the Geek Squad (Best Buy tech support).Geek Squad comes to the house and I explain my issue, and how I have tried resetting the TV many times and the issue always comes back. The Geek Squad resets my TV and the next day, the issue comes back. I call Toshiba and they tell me to bring the TV to a Best Buy store.So I’m standing in the Best Buy store and guess what they tell me....... CALL TOSHIBA. So now I’m ready to lose it but I’m trying to stay patient. On the phone with Toshiba and they say ..... wait for it ...... CALL THE GEEK SQUAD... because they are the “only ones” who can issue a return.At this point I don’t know what to do. I just want a working TV. This has been without a doubt the worst customer experience I have ever had. There is a 1 year manufacturer warranty, so Toshiba can issue the return, but they won’t. No one wants to take responsibility for the TV that clearly is defective.Any advice if you have a similar situation would be greatly appreciated.",1
1.0,"Terrible Remote, Good TV, Some audio timing issues.
  
","August 5, 2019",Yes,"REVIEW UPDATE: A month after I purchased it, the remote's power button stopped working. I opened it up in an attempt to understand the problem, but one of the screws was hidden under a customer support label, resulting in that part breaking. once I got under it, there was a differently-sized set of more than double the number that were on the outside layer. I gave up and threw away the remote, but I'm now finding that it doesn't really have good support for keyboard and mouse----Honestly, it's a great deal for the most part, but I've had some notable issues:1. Alexa on the TV refuses to pair with Alexa on my phone2. Quite frequently, the audio comes out earlier than video. This only happens with built-in apps, most frequently YouTube, but sometimes Netflix. This issue does not occur with Bluetooth audio devices or HDMI inputs to my current experience. Have not tested TOSLink output or RCA input.3. It boasts it's DTS surround sound certification upon every time you turn it on, yet it only seems to be stereo. Maybe if you turned it up really loud, it might have a trick for surround sound, but I've never tried that because I live in an apartment.The upsides:1. It's cheap, relative to other TVs.2. It works well for the most part.3. It's at least got the capability to use Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video, PS Vue and YouTube. HBO GO and HBO NOW depend on who you subscribe through. Xfinity only ""supports"" their DVR, Xbox, and PC. (Thank you for the inconvenience, Xfinity!) Your mileage will vary on that last bit.4. Durability: Cannot verify.

It has great clarity and picture quality, and watching some light television on it was great. But when I watched a sci-fi show with lots of low rumbling space noises, the audio was terrible. It rattled and reverberated, and was just terribly distracting - but I ordered an inexpensive sound bar to connect to the TV, and now I can enjoy high quality picture AND sound. While I would have preferred to not tack another $40 onto the cost of the television to make it perform its best, the whole thing was not too big a deal. I do love how slim and sleek the television is, so I think it's reasonable to assume that they made sacrifices on sound in order to make the display so compact. Ultimately, I recommend this television, as I found it very easy to set up and get going, and I'm really happy with the smart features and integration of all the apps I used regularly on my Roku or Apple TV.",1

First the sound on commercials on one channel went. Next time it just didn't want the sound of the local channel 5-but sound on the commercials. Each time I unplugged everything---power, cable attachment--as well as doing set up again--audio preferences--everything reset . One day sound and no picture!. Then turning on a local (32 in Chicago) to watch the Bears game--the commentary was in Spanish. As much as I wished I had a second language--I don't. I looked at the language preference and it still was English. Instead of watching together we all went to our rooms where the Samsungs and Sony were broadcasting English.

Tried to get help on the Amazon site, when you do you're told the item requires special attention.... When you click on that it takes you to more screens that eventually lead you back to the first screen and it again tells you the item needs special attention.  No resolution there, even less help, just an annoying rabbit hole of nothingness.  Oh, don't click on the call us link because it too takes you to the same circular rabbit hole that will lead you back to the first page that starts you I the goose chase.So I tried calling Toshiba, explained my problem, was told it might be faulty HDMI cables..  Swapped out the cable on the non responsive Tv for the ones on the identical functioning Tv, still nothing, meanwhile the functioning Tv was working just fine with the cable taken from the non functioning one.  At this point they asked if I had any new cables...  I asked if by new they meant newer than the two month old cables I was using.....  He said that to remove all doubt about the cables, I should purchase a new one, and call back....  Ok fine...Bought new cables, no big deal here because I'll use them either way....  Called Toshiba again.... Went through the BS again and whammo.....  Still no sound from any of the inputs.  Art this point they suggest calling Amaon back.Went back to Amazon site, pulled up order, clicked return/replace...  Oh yeah, the rabbit hole...  Well, maybe I'm just dumb... So we try  it again...  Nope, not me, it's an actual rabbit hole...  ""Look kids, it's Big Ben!""  I think to myself as I start to circle around the loop.  At this point, I exit the Amazon site, I Google the customer service number and call in. ...Go over everything, explain everything I've done tell them it's my desire to have the item replaced only to be told that's not an available option....

The screws went in one silver hole and one black hole.Setup was super easy.  Just answer ""yes"" or ""continue.""  Everything worked fine.  It did take me a bit to figure out I had to hold down the mic button the whole time I spoke to Alexa.  Originally, I just touched it, it made a noise, and I spoke.  I was ignored.I will say that I haven't watched much with Amazon Prime.  They have thousands of B,C, and D movies from the 90's.  Why would I want to spend two hours of my life watching some loser movie?  I wish they had a selection of older movies from the 40's to the 60's.  I didn't even see any from the 80's.

","November 28, 2018",Yes,"We bought this to replace our 50"" HDTV.  It shipped to use VERY quickly from Best Buy, almost too fast if that's possible.  We were given a delivery estimate of Wednesday and planned to be home for the delivery.  However, at work on Monday we got notice it was out for delivery with UPS!  Fortunately UPS allows you to give alternate delivery instructions and I was able to direct them to hold the TV at their facility a few miles from our house.  I picked it up the next day.  It was exceptionally well packaged.  Overall a great job on the packing and shipping front.Setup and installation was straightforward which is a good thing.The mount from our old 50"" TV worked fine with the new 55"" TV.  So I moved the mounts over and hung the TV in place of the old one.  It's a two person job unless you are really strong and confident.  I did it myself... :)As you face the TV the power plug is on the RIGHT side back of the set.  The audio and antenna inputs are on the LEFT.  The supplied power cord was way short for our needs so I had to do some temporary rewiring to get everything working.We use an antenna to pick up over the air channels.  The plug for this (as you face the TV) is on the RIGHT facing DOWN.  The antenna transferred to the new TV with no problems.  The USB port on the TV provided sufficient power to make the powered antenna do it's thing.  The FireTV experience with over the air channels is a huge upgrade from our older set.We were upgrading to a single set with the FireTV integrated into it.  Our prior setup had a separate FireTV.  Hence there were three remotes involved:  FireTV, TV and our sound bar.  However, the sound bar worked with the TV remote.  So we powered everything up with the TV remote, controlled volume with the TV remote but navigated the FireTV with the FireTV remote.I thought I would be able to get down to ONE remote with this setup but I wasn't that lucky...Turns out my sound bar has RCA inputs (no Dolby support), optical (supports Dolby) and coax digital.  However, the set offers HDMI / ARC, optical and of course RCA.  So the only common input for the sound bar was optical.  This would be fine except the optical output from the TV has a fixed volume level.  So the only way to control the TV volume is through the sound bar remote.  So we are back to having two remotes.  The FireTV remote controls powering up the TV and navigating the FireTV.  The sound bar remote controls powering up the sound bar and the volume.  So this was a bit of a downgrade in that I now have to power two things up when before I only had one.  Plus I still have two remotes either of which can get lost and trigger a temper tantrum on my part.  On well!I ended up leaving the TV speakers on (they are tinny and very weak) so we could get some audio until the sound bar is turned on.  That way when we lose the sound bar remote we can at least START watching TV until it's found.  Seriously, I have a knack for making things complex and my wife wants a simple solution where one turns on the TV, gets both good picture and audio and can adjust the volume.  How unreasonable of her!  Instead she gets instructions on how to work the TV.  Good but not great.So I have to investigate how to get the HDMI ARC port to work with the sound bar.  In theory I think this will allow me to control the volume of the sound.  The other option would be to purchase a new sound system that supports ARC but we weren't up for that esp considering if we did this there would really be no upgrade in sound just better integration between the components.  If I am going to fork over that much money you can bet I'll looking for better audio not just the ability to connect things.If the TV had a digital coax output this may or may not have been an issue.  I would not have had to use the optical port with fixed output but the coax digital port may have also had a fixed volume output.Overall I am pleased with the purchase.  I might have looked for a TV that could better support my sound setup.  However, I am not disappointed with what I got.",1

What's more, if you hadn't discovered the amazing Amazon Fire TV capabilities - you gotta switch ASAP.  I thought (wrongly!) that having Amazon Prime Video capability on my iPad was sufficient (combined with streaming to TV), but was I wrong.  But ""THE"" key item I wasn't expecting at all was the number of free HD channels it was able to capture using my HD  TV indoor antenna (also purchased through Amazon).  Using my previous Smart TV (only 3 years old) I was only getting 14 channels (in reality only 10 because receptions for others were terrible), but suddenly the new Toshiba Fire TV was capturing over 30 channels WITH great quality (...using the same HD TV antenna I was using before placed exactly as before!!!).",1

","August 6, 2019",Yes,"I’ve had this TV for a little over a month now which is enough time for me to form a thought through opinion, in short I do not recommend purchasing this. Now, to explain:Set up was simple yet complicated. Most TV’s ask a million questions when setting up and use phrases and references that the average person doesn’t understand. This TV does not which was great, it’s quite simple actually. You put in your WiFi info and it asks very simple and straight forward questions. The complicated or moreso anxiety ridden part was that it took over an hour because it “checked for updates” a total of 7 times which made me wary of how old this model or specific unit was.Second, this TV freezes wwwaaayyy more than it should. Twice now I’ve had to unplug it because it froze up.Third and maybe most of all is that the remote is garbage. The TV has no buttons at all so it’s completely reliant on the remote which only works when it feels like working. Buttons get stuck, like I’ll be scrolling and it’ll decide to just keep going. Worst of all is the volume button, I’ll go to turn it up one or two notches and it’ll get stuck and go all the way to 100 which I will frantically be trying to turn down. Sometimes the volume down does the same thing and I’ll miss something because of it.All in all, I got this TV but there was a super sale, I spent less than $200. That being said you’re getting what you pay for, know that.",1

It's no XBR, but it didn't cost that much either.  I use it for YouTube, Netflix, Disney+, Red Bull, and thats about it.  For Netflix and Disney the picture is flawless.  On YouTube I sometimes see some blocks in the bottom right of the screen that are green when that isn't the picture, but it doesn't bother me.

This can also happen when using an app, like Netflix. As a result, you are not able to change channels or switch between apps. It would show a message that it's trying to open the app ""forever""  2) After powering the TV, it won't connect to the Wi-Fi right away. It says the ""signal is weak"" even though the router is next to it. This means you can still watch live TV but the apps won't load.The only way to resolve both of these issues is by restarting the TV, which it's very inconvenient and frustrating but solves the issue at hand.I have contacted Amazon, which led me to Best Buy, which led me to Toshiba....we'll see how they respond to the issue and if they can replace the TV.

Since we had passed one year, the warranty wouldn't cover it anymore. It's frustrating that a TV that is in otherwise pristine condition can just stop working in this way.

I have a young daughter and only her and I use our amazon and fire stick account.The app EPIX is one that is pre-installed I'm guessing. It is recommending shows that are completely inappropriate! One of them is called ""Sex Life"" along with a few others.  The rep went through our watch history and found nothing that lined up with the show title, only family friendly shows.  At first she insisted it was because of us watching a similar title...FALSE.We tried deregistering and re-registering my amazon account several times to no avail.  She finally advised that she would forward my issue to the engineering team.  A few days later she called back and suggested we highlight the unwanted recommendation and hit the menu button so we could delete it.  It didn't give an option to remove it. She has now advised that she will forward this ""new info"" to engineering and they will call back.I'm completely unhappy with Fire TV.  They should have a home page/content that lines up with your settings.  Parental controls are in place and my daughter can't watch the title without entering a passcode but she still is able to view the titles/images that shouldn't be there in the first place.  At least netflix lets you ""thumbs down"" a title and it's removed immediately.Fire TV has a long way to go as far as customer customizations.  They can't compete at all in my opinion. Something as simple as removing a title from a recommendations list should be a given.I don't recommend this at all! At this point I'm ready to get rid of all Amazon products I have.

Now I can just turn on the TV and have it connect to the Comcast box on HDMI 1. Without that tip, I had to manually select the HDMI 1 input using thenTV’s remote and then used the Comcast remote to control the DVR.Another thing to note is that the TV does not have a YouTube app because Amazon and Google don’t play well together. We also have a Roku TV and that one can play YouTube videos. Fortunately our Comcast box has a YouTube app, a Prime Video app, and Netflix so we can just watch videos that way.

I really had sworn off all-in-one units but pulled the trigger on Prime Day and &lt;poof&gt;, there was a Toshiba 50 in my living room.Picture = 7/10 It's better than most units in the price point but it's not a 480 Hz Samsung.Sound (internal) = 4/10 I found the internal speaker to be bright and tinny. (more later)Price = 9/10  If you add up a 50in 4K, FireTV stick, Ethernet adapter, and Sideclick remote for volume, it would be very close.Remote = 9/10Ok, sound...  Ugh..  The internal speakers by themselves we not so great, so idea #1 was to add on a sub.  There are two outputs (3.5mm headphone jack and optical out)  so sure why wouldn't it work?  Turns out, when something is connected to either outputs the internal speakers turn off.  I tried connecting a sub to the optical out but that would require more gear with an extra remote.  My final solution was to run headphone jack to RCA into a BOSE Cinemate Series 1.  Problem solved.Now on to the stuff I really, really like about the TV.1)  It is a complete FireTV interface not a Toshiba TV and an add-on app.  All the TV functions are run through FireTV menu items for a super clean integration.  I just hope the engineers thoroughly test against the TVs because that could be a bad day.2)  The price ('nuff said)3)  The OTA tuner has a channel guide built-in.  I don't watch a lot of terrestrial content but it's nice to see the schedule of upcoming shows.  Gone are the days of blind channel surfing.  Hurrah!  There is also a built-in buffer so you can pause and rewind live TV.4)  The TV automatically turns off.  Now I'm not talking about a sleep timer that you have to set.  Oh no..  This is so much better.  If you are watching a video and it ends, first it goes to the screen saver, waits,  and then turns itself off.  Great for watching movies at bedtime.5)  There is now only ONE, easy to use remote sitting on my table.  Change channels, switch inputs, adjust volume, power on/off all from a single remote at no extra charge?  But you say... ""Al, all TVs do that.""  Not in my world.  There were 4 remotes to keep track of, checklists how to watch different media, training classes for the family, tech support calls when I'm on the road, but best of all I didn't have to spend hours programming a $150 universal remote that needed to be kept in sync.Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase and my fingers are crossed that I didn't get a dud.",2

We went to visit her in September, not even a full month from when we gave it to her, went to watch her new TV and it didn't work.  It was like it had no power at all.  I contacted Amazon who had me contact Best Buy who had me contact Toshiba who had me contact The Geek Squad at Best Buy.  We were told by Best Buy because we didn't purchase their protection plan they just couldn't replace it.  It took 2 1/2 weeks, 3 scheduled repair appointments and it was fixed today.  They had to replace the motherboard.  I have never had a TV not work after 1 months of use.  I have other Toshiba products that are great, but for this I say ""buyer beware"".",9

The TV worked for about two months (just past the amazon return window) then starting to have complete connectivity issues. I brought it to geek squad and they sent it out for repairs, only to find there was nothing wrong with it. It worked for a few weeks after this. Then, it suddenly stopped working again. I have spent HOURS on the phone between Amazon, Geek Squad, and Toshiba trying to get this TV to work. I have tried every trouble shooting method. Today a Toshiba representative told me that the device will only work in extreme close proximity to the internet router. How is this TV still allowed to be sold? It currently sits ten feet from the router and still cannot connect. Also, the remote has to constantly be reset because it also uses wireless connectivity. I'm going to donate it to a local organization and hopefully they can use the TV monitor for something, otherwise this is completely useless! DO NOT BUY IT.

5.0,"Great value tv
  
","October 12, 2019",Yes,"Realize this 5 star review is directly related to the cost of this TV. Im not saying it is as great as a 55"" flat screen twice the price but for the price, You WILL be happy with this purchase. This is my second Toshiba TV. This 55"" is a nice Tv for the price. GOOD picture, Great price. If you dont need all the bells and whistles then this will no doubt be your best choice. Again, the picture is very good even though you may read some of the expert reviews claiming the picture is sub par i can say without hesitation you will be happy with the picture quality.  In addition the sound is good too. My only gripe with this tv is the glare. In a totally dark room its fine. if there is any light you will see it reflected on the screen. This is where this particular toshiba model hit its worst performance scores. Bad, very bad but its something you can get used to or control it.  So where are they cutting the corners in order to sell this at such a low cost? It has to be somewhere right?Its light, super light. About half the weight of my previous 42"" toshiba.  Lighter plastic and more of it. Overall, a light duty tv that will probably give you a solid 6-8 years before it fails. Not bad.Lacking inputs. No Component only composite (reed white yellow RCA) which mean no High def for older equipment that does not have hdmi inputs. Wont work at al with my sony surround sound. Had i known this i probably would have spent a little more if the component inputs and additional composite inputs were available. limited usb and hdmi.Finally, there is no doubt that the parts used to put this tv together are probably the cheapest available. You get what you pay for. Dont be surprised if you are looking for a replacement in three years then again it may last till your ready to upgrade.If you dont need to hook up your older surround sound or an older game system. If you just want to watch the tv as is your good to go.For comparison... I like my old 42"" toshiba regza better as i can hook up everything i have and still have inputs left over. It looks and feels a higher quality then this 55"", but it was almost four times the cost! I cant say for sure that all the components in my more expensive tv are better quality but im guessing yes as it is now 12 years old and looks like the day we bought it.Bottom line... I love this tv considering how cheap it was. So easy to set-up and easier to use due to the fact it is a smart tv. I highly recommend this TV just as long as you realize you can do better if you want to spend more money, its relative. BUT, If this TV is in your budget and you are considering comparative TLC or Vizio models. Choose this one. It looks great. Good picture and audio but MOST important it is a toshiba. Toshiba is well know for customer care. Ive owned a ton of toshiba products so yes i have had a few issues here and there but Toshiba customer support went above and beyond EVERY contact. Honestly, they didnt have to do what they did but it has made me as loyal to them as i feel they are to me. I continue to buy toshiba and will continue to recommend toshiba products 75% based on there customer appreciation.If this TV is large enough and in your price range, get it. You can be confident you will be happy with the TV and more so with Toshiba.",0

Then Alexa stopped working. I called Toshiba customer support and I was told to take it to Best Buy for repair. I contacted Amazon about the Alexa issue and was told to go to Best Buy. The Geek Squad do shoddy work and I know from experience. Plus, Best Buy will do whatever it takes to avoid exchanging a faulty item. Again, the TV worked great for a couple of months and then started having problems. My guess is that since it is made in China it is shoddy workmanship related to low wages.  Getting bounced around on the phone by Customer Service reps who follow a script was time consuming and annoying. This TV could have been so much better and far more durable. Save your money and do not buy this shoddy Toshiba junk",1

Setup was quick and easy and the remote is super simple which is a big plus.This would be a five star review if we had not encountered one tiny flaw. The only problem we have encountered is a bad pixel that can be seen in the photos. We didn't notice this until we had been enjoying the television for a couple days. Even a television in this price range should not have this problem so we will see about getting a replacement. Other electronics we have purchased on Amazon that were defective normally were replaced and the defective item returned. The seller of this item only offers a refund after they receive the television back. I would prefer a replacement swap.

The tv was pretty simple to set up, the only part that took a bit to figure out was how to link it to the Dot, which you need to do in the Alexa app.  Otherwise the remote works fine.  The picture is clear (though I really don’t seem to notice a quality different between regular HD and the 4K UHD), response time is quick and we were quickly able to setup all of our streaming services.  Overall very happy with the product.Edit to add: the picture is the 43in UHD and the picture does make it look a bit smaller than it does in person.

I bought this for her are it said it would work with Alexa. It does but it is not intuitive in regards to connecting it inside the Alexa APP. You would think you would go to ""add device"" and pick a TV. However that is not the case. IT cannot find the TV when you do so. What you need to do is go to settings, TV&amp;Video, Fire TV. From there you can ""Manage Devices"" and add your FireTV. if you have bought multiple once from Amazon you will need to know the name of it. I had to find it on the TV settings. Once I had it setup my mom was having fun telling alexa to control it. Sound wise TV is fine for my mom's room and the picture quality is good for the price. I am disappointed in the TV menus. There is no quick way to change settings like picture, contrast, brightness etc. You need to go into the Fire TV app settings to do so. Again not intuitive and seems unnecessary. This again makes it hard for someone that doesn't know a lot about tech to make changes to settings. For mom my once I set it she was good. Which is why this is also a good spare room TV.

It was between this TV or TCL Roku series 5. I picked this TV based on good reviews, the smart features and the great deal on Prime Day. UNFORTUNATELY  ... it was 4 days late!!!! In the meantime, Best Buy lowered the TCL series 5 by $80 for a 49 inch for $299 ... so a little more but 49 inch and series 5 with Dolby Vision. I love the TCL ... so far ... also a great purchase! FINALLY MY REVIEW! Ok ... I got the Toshiba fire TV today and a relative bought it from me but I got to set it up and use it most of the day. Easy set up and fast. Ok guys ... SERIOUSLY, the colors and clarity on this TV is PHENOMENAL! This TV really shines in regular HD viewing and streaming of most series and movies and even satellite reception  ... full HD perfection! Where it falls short is in 4k viewing  ... average at best ... but acceptable. It also excels in smart features. Having Alexa voice remote opens up an entire new world ... works flawlessly. Definitely a SMART TV! Others complained about the interface. I found it to be intuitive. I think people who didn't like it wanted a TV first with the cord. Cord cutters will love this TV. I have Dish ... looks great on this TV ... just click on HDMI 2 and you're there. Yes, you'll need 2 remotes ... big deal! Also, because of Alexa being built in ... you now have the Internet at your fingertips  ... so easy. You can pretty much download whatever you want ... at your own risk, of course. Bottom line ... if the majority of your viewing is 1080 p and you use very little 4k viewing and want a truly smart TV with tons of features ... then this TV is a great buy.

Sure is! Especially when close to the television. But, the TV was $150 for a 32"", what did I expect. I am not at all disappointed with my purchase though. It is worth the money spent.

If you're considering this, just get it! But if you need convincing, I got pros &amp; cons below.ALSO NOTE: One reviewer claims that this thing is 1080p HD only. That's simply not true. This TV is definitely 4k, you just have to find content &amp; apps that support it.

","November 25, 2019",Yes,"I was concerned reading the reviews on this TV when I was buying it.  We needed a bedroom TV.  32"" is perfect for that use.  We don't need 1080p or 4K for an evening movie before bed.  Alexa wasn't a huge deal as we have Google Assistant powered stuff in our house, so I'd slap a Chromecast on it for mobile streaming.  But before I did even that, the TV itself deserves some praise.Setup was easy.  Out of the box, an Amazon and Netflix password, and we were off to the races.  We use over the air and it not only picks up channels, the Fire TV allows some pausing on Live TV so we can skip over commercials (it's not a DVR: you can't record shows, and when you change channels the pause buffer is reset.) That was a pleasant surprise.  The FireTV interface is simple to navigate, with some catches on configuration (figuring out how to stop the TV from sleeping after pausing Netflix longer than 10 minutes could be easier).  The remote is comfortable to hold and very simplified, reminds me of the TiVO remote back in the day.  Only thing that takes getting used to is no channel buttons (channel selection is menu driven).Amazon is also far more agile than other Smart TVs.  We have Vizio's in the living room and master bedroom, and they have had difficulty with Disney +.  This TV had the app on the first day of service, just a short download to add it to the Menus.  We were able to fire up Disney shows on launch week no problem.Where the TV has weak spots: Amazon doesn't have any casting, so you'll be stuck plugging another streaming device in for Mobile use (Chromecast for Android, MS Wireless Display for Windows 10, Apple TV for iOS/iPadOS.) The storage on the TV is very small, which isn't a huge deal, but if you're app heavy, you'll find yourself managing and deleting apps from the TV if you go past 10.  Also, apps affect pause times: the more apps you have, the smaller the pause buffer is.  Voice search works, but the timing of pressing the button and speaking may take some getting used to.  It's quicker than Google Assistant, but you have to hold the button down Push To Talk style, which is not how Google Assistant or Siri works.Especially when the TV is discounted to $120, this is a good extra TV for a bedroom or a den.  We're very happy with it.",0

Off topic I know, but since I watch TV and work on spreadsheets in two different seating positions, I wanted to share my solution.  Back to the TV review.Reading the reviews, there were several complaints about the TV not returning to the last input when shut down and restarted.  A Toshiba representative responded that You can set the TV to go to the last input your tv was [example HDMI1] by starting from that Home menu you don't want to start at then going to Settings - Display and Sounds - Power On and choose Last Input [instead of Home] This will turn on the TV on the last input you were on.Another solution is to just give the TV a voice command.  Saying ""HDMI1"" (to which ""she"" will respond ""okay"") will take it directly to it.  ""Fire TV"" brings the system back to the Fire TV home screen.  Another useful voice command is ""Fire TV off"" to turn the TV off entirely.I am sure that I will have more to add to this review over time and will try to keep it up to date.",0

It’s not my favorite interface but useable.  The Alexa feature works pretty well. Again if you have used Alexa before it’s pretty seamless within its limits.  It’s good for finding a specific show, genre or music.

3.0,"Very Alexa-centric. Great picture/sound.
  
","August 11, 2019",Yes,"Honestly, I wish it weren't so ""smart"". As a TV it has a great picture and sound. My problem is, like a lot of Amazon/Alexa products, it is so focused on selling me add-ons, movies, and other paid content it gets hard to do simple things. The remote is horribly inadequate (32"" model). There are no channel UP/DOWN buttons. You have to use Alexa - waiting to activate the microphone, tell her what to do, hoping she figures it out and then wait for her to do it) - or press several buttons to accomplish simple tasks.I cut the cable years ago and use a combination of over-the-air, Prime, and Netflix. It is nice that the remote has buttons for Prime and Netflix, but that comes at the cost of losing the Channel UP/DOWN and a PREVIOUS Channel button. I would like to watch the late news on say NBC or CBS and then in the morning tune into their morning show. This shouldn't be so hard... but NOOOOO. I have to go through the Alexa/Fire screens every time it is turned on. Also, if I want to channel surf those morning shows I have to use Alexa (with its time lag) or the Fire Remote menus. More like crawling than surfing.I've been working on computers since the 70s. The ""WOW"" factor and flashy screen transitions rarely impress me. They seem to have forgotten the KISS principle - Keep It Simple, Stupid. Next time I'm going for less ""wow"" and more function.",0
3.0,"it was OK, for the Amazon day promotional price.
  
","February 27, 2019",Yes,"I purposely waited a few months before reviewing it so I can write my true long term evaluation on the product.- Price - Amazingly good.  I bought it on Amazon day, and the promotional price was hard to beat.  I did not need another TV, but could not resist the price.- Picture quality.  Quite nice, actually.  Comparable to most other 4K I have seen.  The viewing angle is not that good.  Ok, you can see the picture in a very wide range of viewing angle, but if you were to walk may be more than 3 steps to the side, the will look overly bright, and as you take another step to the side, the picture will turn so bright/white that it will loose all of its perspective of color.- Interface: I understand it is a promotional product, that Amazon wants its consumers to explore services that they do not already use.  However, when  I paid for a product, I expect to feel the I won the product, not the other way around.  In this case, you have very little control on hoe the device behave, other than the picture or sound quality.  You have little or no  control on the  pre-installed apps, because they are not the standard version that one would download from the app store.  For example, your Prime video app have a totally different (and simplified, taking away many options) interface.  When you select and input other than the Amazon menu (say, HDMI), you better have the input signal already playing before you switch to it.  If the TV do not detect a screen signal in like 3 seconds, it will change back to its home-screen (afraid of loosing potential streaming customers to other services?).  This is very inconvenience if you want to select input before actually playing the corresponding screen signal (hood up time, not wanting to miss the first few seconds of viewing, booting up a external device, etc.)-Reliability: So far, no main problem.  I turned itself off a few times, and the only way to reset it was to unplug and plug the power cord (button on remote or TV would not do).  I did have to clear cache  and data for some apps a few time, but other device does that, too.After all, there is nothing to write home about.  I am not disappointed, mainly because of the price I paid.  I would even call it a good product for that price.",0

There are less expensive TV recorders (say $45) but they do not have a workable touch-and-fell interface.~ Channels we lost in the transition are Golf, USA, PRM, APL (Animal Planet) and the History Channel; Obviously not a show stopper.",1

","July 24, 2019",Yes,"When I first purchase this tv it arrived broken. The box itself was dented by probably another box (see picture) which put pressure on the fragile screen. I was dismayed but I messaged the seller (Best Buy) to see if they can send me a replacement. Messaging the seller turned out to be the right move. Best Buy instructed me to send the product back by initiating an Amazon return. I returned it to my local Best Buy, and they checked the tv for the damages. Best Buy instructed me to buy a new one at the price listed, and then they would refund me the price difference. I did just that and received the TV a little earlier than originally listed on the expected delivery date. Setting up the TV is extremely easy. I was under the assumption that the built in Alexa was going to work like an Amazon Echo, but it’s more of a glorified TV assistant (which is fine). I linked my Netflix account, my Spotify account, and I even linked other streaming services via the Mozilla app. I’m able to browse the internet while still in bed. Overall I am very satisfied with the picture quality, the intuitiveness of the built in Alexa smart remote, and how easy everything was to set up. I’m extremely happy that Best Buy was able to address the issue of the broken tv and that they were very prompt. I would recommend this TV to my friends and family.",0
1.0,"DO NOT BUY THIS TV - SOUND ISSUES IF YOU NEED TO USE HDMI INPUTS OR HAVE COMCAST
  
","November 26, 2019",Yes,"I hate writing such a negative review, but this was a Prime Day purchase that didn't include enough research. The HDMI inputs (ALL 3) are so horrible I can't even express to you the level of frustration I have had with this TV since my brother set it up only a week and a half ago. I use the HDMI input to attach my laptop so I can stream m Comcast/XFINITY cable shows into the TV (just fyi you would have to use the HDMI inputs whether you use your laptop or a cable box). You may ask why not use those nifty apps, like the A&amp;E one or HGTV one you see in the picture well, because if you have Comcast/XFINITY as your cable provider you are not allowed to use those nifty little apps, so you are left with the ONLY option and it is to use the HDMI inputs. And I have tried each HDMI input and all are bad; the sound is raspy, it crackles non-stop or it is all together not there, right in the middle of a show. And the sad thing is all you have to do is unplug from your computer and re-plug and then the input is fine again. HOWEVER, for someone who needs to situate herself to get comfy, the inconvenience of getting up is not just about sitting up and moving, its about discomfort and pain, but I digress. Just please do not buy this TV if there is any chance at ANY moment you will need to use HDMI inputs. I have video because I was actually getting a shot of my pup wanting to watch LivePD, its hilarious how much he loves that show, but the moment was lost because the music didn't play and I had to move to unplug and re-plug. I know first world problems, but if you are going to spend your money, we should all get a product that is a good product when we spend our money, so don't spend it on this.

It was in our bedroom so it didn't get heavy use. We were still under warranty. Contacted Amazon, who had to contact Toshiba, who had to contact Best Buy and have the Geek Squad sent out. They figured it was the power supply that was the problem. But because we bought this TV through Amazon, we had a difficult time trying to get Best Buy (who actually sold the TV through Amazon) to order the part because we didn't have a best buy order number or a paper receipt. But eventually they did. It had been about 2 weeks at this point. The Geek Squad returned with the part. Except it was the WRONG PART.  So we are now still waiting for them to order the new part and come back. They can't come back for another 2 weeks. By then it will have been a month without this TV working.",1

Fortunately, I saw on my Ring doorbell and sent my husband to pull it inside while I nursed a migraine.  Next day I realized it was the wrong brand and wrong size.  I called Amazon and they told me to return the TV to the store and reorder the correct one.  I tried.  It was no longer available so they told me to order another TV and Amazon would pay the difference.  Now I don't purchase big items from Amazon but this sounded fishy.  I fretted overnight and enlisted my daughter to help since she is more experienced.  As it turned out it was fishy and the second person I had talked to was not authorized to say such a thing.

Rewinding a streaming show and adjusting the volume while waiting for it to play again caused the entire app to crash. It doesn’t matter which app I’m using. Everything gets stuck. Waking the TV (it goes to sleep), the screen saver paused and the TV became completely unresponsive until I pressed the power button. I constantly have to ride the volume button, as sometimes 8 is too loud, while other times 75 is too quiet. Watching Hulu with commercials is awful because the ads are blasting.

(I did manage to dim it with multiple layers of clear packing tape ‘painted’ with black permanent marker.)Second, unlike the Fire TV 4K stick the remote is infrared. UPDATE: the TV remote appears to be infrared but the Fire TV part of the remote doesn't require line of sight. So, you can turn the TV on by pushing the Home button or one of the 'quick' buttons (Netflix, etc.) at the bottom of the remote.Also, be sure to dig into the settings to turn off all the unexplained monitoring stuff in privacy settings. Some vague ‘send viewing habits’ blather doesn’t really explain who gets data about what you watch. In the post-Cambridge-Analytica era this is slightly creepy.**One other FAIRLY BIG TRADEOFF the ethernet connection appears to be 100Mbps. Streaming from a Plex Server the max transfer rate is ~12MBps (roughly equivalent to 100Mbps). I tested the speed connections using Google's Speedtest and both the wired and wireless connections appear to max out around 100Mbps. While this doesn't seem particularly slow, UHD 4K movies require more bandwidth than 100Mbps. So...there's that.I guess there's a reason the TV is so low cost: other than screen it's pretty cheap.

","November 18, 2019",Yes,"EDIT: Now the WiFi function is having issues! The tv still refuses to work with the Ethernet cable. It says that the cable is plugged in, but there’s a problem with the network connection. No, the problem is with the software, which Toshiba refuses to fix. So I fall back to the WiFi, which will work for a few hours, sometimes a few minutes.The Apple TV box and the Blu-ray player, both connected to the same modem, work just fine. I’ll have to use them as input devices for streaming video until I can justify replacing this thing. I will never buy another Toshiba product. Crappy software and no support.ORIGINAL: I bought this set in March 2019. The picture and sound quality is excellent, and I like the UI and remote control. It has the number of HDMI connections I needed. I haven't yet used the component or optical audio output connectors.It's also great to have an Ethernet connection, as our fiber modem is on the other side of the wall from the TV. Nice to have an Internet connection for 4K video that doesn't suck bandwidth from the wifi. Until it stopped working last week. I arrived home from work with nothing changing while I was away, except possibly for a software update while the set was off. I managed to break the screen while trying to check the Ethernet connection. I liked the set enough to order another, and figured that the new one would have working Ethernet. While I waited, I connected my laptop and another, smaller LG set to the same cable. Both worked fine. I set up the new Toshiba, and this one also told me to check my Ethernet connection. What the heck? The cable is properly connected. The modem is passing network traffic on that cable.It has to be that a software update that broke the Ethernet usability. So fix it!If you don't have an Ethernet connection, I heartily recommend this set. If you do, I recommend it anyway--just be patient and use wifi for now.",0

Some have made mention of a grayed black scale, which in part is true how ever this can be corrected for the most part by going into settings and adjusting the HDR calibration, setting the dynamic range to highest and you will achieve true black scaling.One of my biggest surprises was I am also using this as a monitor and it produces true 4K UHD HDR 4096 x 2160with a brilliance that is worth mentioning!It is a true sound machine with a volume range that truly leaves some of the competition behind.Gaming at it best!

Now back to the TV The picture seems pretty decent for the price and 4k. Refresh rate could be better but oh well. The sounds isnt the best but not the worst average. The remote could be better needs a few more common buttons like channel and input. The fire stick built into to the tv is pretty cool an extra thrown in. Decent line up of stuff but still think the roku is king of media stream devices bieng it has more free channels to add. But the fire has a better web browser and a market of sorts for apps. I also own a roku so no biggie. Now the menu is ok on the tv but could be better like getting to regular over the air tv is kinda wierd and changing the channels.

The screen looks nice (maybe my standards are low, its my first 4k), the audio is loud and clear (I put it at 50 out of 100 so I can hear it from 25 ft away while cooking and generally have the volume under 20, to give you an idea of how loud it is).And yeah, its an Amazon TV so you're getting Amazon promo stuff. I never notice it, I just instinctively scroll down to what I'm actually looking for. My main problem with this TV is that the apps for it are terrible. I'm a news junkie and CNN takes forever to load, MSNBC (actually just NBC, there isn't a separate MSNBC app) rarely if ever loads, in fact, only Fox News works properly. Plex is also a risky proposition with this TV, sometimes it works great, sometimes it doesn't work at all. I suspect it has something to do with the TV telling the server it can handle a format that it actually can't and so the server isn't transcoding it properly, but I haven't actually figured out the exact problem, so I'm just making an educated guess. I've found myself having to go into the settings to manually reset the TV several times trying to interact with those apps. Ultimately I found myself sideloading my Verizon FIOS app to watch TV, and yeah I had to sideload it because Amazon doesn't have a Verizon app of its own. Which caused its own problem because the app needs a mouse to work (not a big deal for me, I had a spare wireless mouse, but just be advised).But, now that I have that all sorted out, I have a relatively lovely TV that I am pretty happy with (especially for the price) that has all the cable channels I pay for without actually having to pay extra for a cable box (or even be connected to the cable outlet). The wifi works well, I can watch Plex (with the caveat mentioned above), TV (via the FIOS app), Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc. without stuttering despite the router being on a different floor. Still, if there's ever an open source OS so I can jailbreak this puppy (maybe just replace its Amazon OS with something like OpenELEC), I'll be all over it.",0

We just need to tell Alexa ""Tune to CNN"" and she will turn on the TV, open Hulu, and launch the channel. If we say ""Tune to channel 3"", she will open our local antenna feed. That part is absolutely amazing.However, the display is a completely different story. The 4K display on this unit looks horrible compared to all of my other 1080 and 720 TV's. When I first turned it on, my wife was so upset with the horrible display that she wanted me to return it.You can find websites that provide the recommended/optimal display settings and it helped but it still isn't that great.Overall, the screen is always washed out and there are no dark tones. Everything is either too bright or washed out. I was expecting crisp detailed video like other HDTV's but not with this unit. I can't tell the difference when viewing something in 4K vs normal HD.",0
4.0,"Mediocre TV, but at a Good Price and with Nice Integrate Features
  
","January 27, 2019",Yes,"First and foremost, realize that just because this says ""4K"" does not mean it will be of any exceptional image quality. Most HD formats are 1080 anyway, so you don't really gain much with 4K, plus your eye can't even discern the difference in pixels on a screen this size at normal viewing distances. 4K is mostly a marketing gimmick for this TV. Other factors much more significantly affect image quality, such as contrast and local dimming, which this TV is noticeably lacking. Similarily, realize that this is NOT an HDR TV. It can play back HDR content, but will only display it in SDR and with a normal color gamut. It's not a bad TV for an affordable option if you're not a cinephile or expecting too much for a bargain deal. The Fire TV integration is nice since you can control it with your voice using either the included remote or a connected Alexa device, but the tradeoff is that using this TV with over the air antenna broadcasts is cumbersome as the channel guide does not allow simply clicking from one channel to another. That is, there is no channel up or down button, and you cannot type in a channel number and go to that channel, so channel surfing is not possible on this TV. Instead, it shows a smart guide with a thumbnail and title of the current program, the name of the network, and the schedule of what is upcoming, but it does not show the channel number, so you will have to relearn what you call all your regular over the air channels! A nice bonus is being able to pause live TV (but only for a few minutes- enough for a bathroom break), but you cannot record programs per se, or skip commercials. The sound is actually surprisingly good for an economy TV, but the blacks and contrast are lacking for cinematic movies.",0
5.0,"Exactly what I was looking for.
  
","December 16, 2018",Yes,"So first, let me point out by far the two worst things about this TV.  1) It is meant for the cord-cutters, if you primarily use only streaming apps then it's great, but if you want to use HDMI input or something like that it's not as good, although a new setting does promise to default to your last input I haven't tried it.  2) It is thick, many other posts have mentioned this, but even though I'd read those I didn't expect it to be as thick as it is, it's literally inches thicker than the old samsung it replaced, like whatever you're thinking on thick, just add a few inches, cause it is seriously thick, so thick that I want to buy another one of these for my main living room, but I'm not going to put a TV this thick into such a prominent public space.  I thought people were just complaining about it being thick, but that ""thick"" had to be okay still cause it was many years newer than my old TV.  Anyway, not a problem for me cause I use this as a TV in a back bedroom anyway, but I wouldn't be happy with how thick it is in my main living room.Now that all that's out of the way, I still give it 5-stars.  Why?  Cause it's freaking amazing.  First off the picture is 4k which was an upgrade for the TV this replaced, and the picture looks great.  I am also just using the stock TV speakers for now, and they're surprisingly decent for built-in speakers.  But what I love most about it, is how gosh darn quick and responsive the interface is.  When I power it on, it powers up near instantly, and when I open an app it acts like it's just alt-tab switching to it like it was already open, and when I navigate the apps, they move so quick.  I primarily use Plex, and on my old TV I had to wait for Roku to boot up, took forever, then I had to launch the plex app, which also took forever, then Plex was slow to navigate and would sometimes crash.  All those issues are gone with Fire TV built-into this TV.  Plex just opens instantly and navigates flawlessly, so quick, I love it, and since I primarily just use that one app where this TV is, this is perfect for me.Also, I didn't expect to care at all about the alexa-enabled feature, as I already have a bunch of echo dots and a lot of home automation...  however, I actually love the alexa remote.  I often ask alexa to do something, like set an alarm, or adjust lighting, ect...  and when the TV is on this can make alexa not hear me well.  However, with the alexa remote it automatically pauses the video while I press-to-talk to alexa, and automatically unpauses when I let go, and this surprisingly works out really well for me.This TV was seriously cheap, I got the 50"" for under $300.  That was a huge plus.  Also the whole reason I got it was it was one of the only 4K TV's on the market with Fire TV built-in.  That was important to me because I had having several remotes just to use the TV, I want to just always use the native TV remote, so buying a 4k TV and then adding an external Fire TV box wasn't an ideal solution for me.  Plus being alexa-enabled I can turn it on by voice with the other echos in the house, not a huge deal, but it is nice to be able to turn it on by voice as I'm walking towards the room it's in so it's ready to go when I get there, even though it does turn on extremely fast anyway.Overall, I just love how fast the menu is.  That's something you never really know until you get your hands on it, and it's such a stark contrast to the TV it replaced, that I want to replace more TVs with this for their 4k Upgrade, however, the thickness bothers me for a main living room.  I'd pay three times as much if they'd make a thin 65"" version of this and I'd buy it for the main living room.",0

I had inserted a USB flash drive into the USB port to test it, and that caused the TV to always return to the home screen and input was set to the USB port.  As soon as I removed the USB flash drive, it now returns to the Last Input (HDMI-1, Dish network) when the TV is powered on.

","December 24, 2018",Yes,"First off the actual television works perfectly. Great picture, sound quality is similar to most thin screen TVs. I have no complaints about that. Here are my issues with the TV.1.  How can amazon release a ‘smart’ TV that you cannot set a routine with?  I would like this to turn on in the morning. I like to use the TV as my alarm clock and watch ESPN while I get up. My 9 year old Samsung that I replaced this with did that and it was dumb as a door nail. When I tell it to turn off ‘bedroom tv’ (which is what it’s named) it claims it cannot find it. (BTW, I renamed it Fire tv and it still couldn’t find it.)2.  I have this perfectly paired with an Alexa in my bedroom. It will go to fire tv, switch to satellite input, find movies, shows etc., all with the command of Alexa do ‘’’’’this.  What it won’t do is turn it off or on or adjust the volume. Spent about 2 hours total with customer service and they are baffled as well.3.  The menu for TV settings is clunky. You have to go to fire tv main menu, scroll over to settings, scroll to picture and guess what it will look like with the changes you make. Maybe there is a better way but I cannot find it. Fortunately the picture was fine so no need for me to really fool with it.For me this was/is a great replacement for my 9-10 year old Samsung. But you can’t really call it a smart tv if it cannot turn on/off at a specific time, or when you tell it too. With a couple of small updates it’s a 5 star..as it is, it’s just another tv.",0

But that is a minor issue.The Amazon video's on the TV are all mixed together. On the computer you have movies on one line and TV shows on another line, was the same with my older TV and a Roku XD box. Makes it easy to find a particular movie or TV show on the watch list.I also don't like how Fire has previews of movies that start the trailer when you click on my watch list, unless you click watch list twice fast. Never had previews on the old TV and would like to get rid of themCalled Amazon support about my complaints and was told the tech team would be notified. Was also told that if enough people call and complain they will make the changes sooner.So if you would like your movies and TV shows on separate lines on your Fire addition TV and also get rid of the previews. Call Amazon support and complain. If enough people do this, we can make or Amazon video experience simpler and more enjoyable.",0

","December 30, 2018",Yes,"I’ve had the tv for 30 days now, and I love it. Let me say this right away: For those people saying the sound is bad, I don’t know what kind of tv’s you have owned that are louder than this one, I’ve had a LOT of different flatscreens! Sony, Samsung, vizio, LG, element, and likely more. I’ve had several of each of those brands. THIS TV HAS EXCELLENT SOUND! I actually had to turn it around and look and try to see what toshiba did so differently to make this tv sound so good! I have the 50” model, and I’m not sure if the reviews here are applying to all size tv’s, but the one that I have, the toshiba 50” fire tv edition, HAS GREAT SOUND! And Bassy too. So aside from the sound, everything else about fire tv edition feels right at home. The screen is very much like the home screen of fire tv stick or box. There are a few extra options in the home screen on FTE that you wouldn’t see on the stick, like HDMI inputs, display settings etc... The display looks good for what you pay for the tv. Not bad, but not Blown away exactly. Let’s just say it was exactly what I expected. I have always been a fan of the fire tv remotes, so have the extra buttons on the for volume and quick access buttons to HBO and Netflix and such is really nice. This controller also has an infrared array in the front of it. I’m not yet sure if that actually is what the FTE uses to control it or if things are done like it has always been done on fire stick and firebox. Either way, I do know you can point that remote completely in the other direction and it will still receive the command. I love it.  I will update this review if I encounter any problems with the TV from here on out. Though, I am not worried if one arises because I bought the Protection plan for them.",0

","July 19, 2019",Yes,It's an ok TV but if I had bought it at a store I probably would have returned it for something else.  The menus switching between the streaming services and regular TV are extremely slow and sometimes will cut off and restart.  Everytime you turn the TV on it takes you to a menu where you have to scroll to the icon that allows you to watch your regular cable or satellite TV service.  I wish there was a way to bypass that screen.  It also doesn't allow you to view non HD channels in full screen mode without messing up the aspect ratio of your HD channels.  So when I'm watching my direct TV non HD channels they all appear as a small box in the middle of the screen with large black spaces all around framing it.I do like the Alexa integration and I also like how Netflix and Hulu are already installed and easy to access.  I also like how inexpensive it was.  I'll probably keep it for another year and then get something better.  Maybe not another Fire TV.,0

In other words, on any other TV, if you are on HDMI 1 and turn it off, next time you turn it on, your TV will still be on HDMI 1 so that you can go right back into playing Xbox, or whatever.

It seemed like a great deal and value; however, its fallen short for my needs in just about every way. For starters, just scrolling through channels is a challenge with this TV. My office has an analog cable feed that allows you to view meetings in our building. There's no guide data, so sometimes to tune in, I just need to scroll the 14 channels we have to see what is airing and on what channel. There is no ""channel"" button or other button that permits this functionality. If you use the multipurpose circle on the remote it thinks you are trying to fast forward/rewind. You can toggle down and select each channel from a list, but it's time consuming and frustrating if you don't know what channel you need. Furthermore, when using the toggle feature, the channel listing is shown chronologically, instead of numerically, so it immediately toggles you to the most recently viewed channels (which if I'm trying to scroll to unviewed channels, takes more time to get to channels I haven't checked yet).Furthermore, I thought I could utilize AirPlay from Chrome so I could display work on my desktop to an audience in my office. Nope...this TV doesn't have that functionality built-in and no app capability that I could find. Also, the process of downloading Apps and content I wanted was time consuming. The setup process nearly wouldn't work at all via my WiFi network and I had to hotspot my phone and data to maintain a connection. My work has blocked servers for certain web content (netflix, hulu, etc.), understandably, so this TV is essentially useless when ""off line.""

Be prepared to sit through the updating procedure once you connect to the internet with the TV. After two TV updates, a remote update 30 minutes later the TV was ready for use.

The contrast is very good, certainly more than adequate for a PC monitor.  Blacks are very good but not great.  The biggest problem with this Toshiba is that the picture quickly becomes very dim off to all four sides.  As a monitor, this isn't much of an issue since the viewer would normally be watching straight on.  However, if this were being used as a TV and there are viewers off to the side or above or below the screen, this TV would be a poor choice.  P.S. - I gave the Toshiba 4 stars for Smart Features based on the ""manual"" but I haven't had any reason to use any of these features.

I replaced an old 40” TV with this one and was expecting that it would fill the same space however due to no speakers in the front and much smaller frame it takes a lot less space so if upgrading from older LCD TVs go up a few inches. Also not a big fan of the limited remote. I like to put captions on to keep noise levels down but finding how to turn captions on has been a challenge with some of the apps like Hulu.

I downloaded and set up Netflix and YouTube after the updates.If you are particular about ads and privacy, go to settings and turn off what you are uncomfortable with.Rename your inputs so you can ask Alexa to switch to Cable or to Blu-ray. It is even cooler when you pair to an echo device - you can ask Alexa to open YouTube without touching the remote. You can also ask Alexa to turn on/off Fire TV.The picture quality is very good. I tested how it handles 4K HDR content by playing the Planet Earth II Blu-ray.I have a little concern that the TV is not really off when you ""turn it off""... but will do some more research on that.I will see how the TV continues to behave with the passage of time; but for now, a very good TV at the price.",0

One minor irritation is the audio out jack (a 3.5mm stereo jack on the back of the TV) cuts the audio from the TVs speakers. Why would the manufacturer do this?!?! The jack is on the back of the TV so likely nobody is going to plug headphones in (or else they would be sitting very close to the TV). I wanted to use the audio out to feed my surround sound stereo system, but I don't always want to have to use the surround through the stereo if I am just watching a situation comedy or something like that.

","July 21, 2019",Yes,"Bought this on Prime Day, was a good price for a big tv. I read some of the negative reviews that the screen had some flickering issues after using it for some time. If that occurs with this one I’ll come back and reevaluate the rating.So far, so good. Or at least it’s OK. The screen is nice, I don’t notice any whiteout in the corners. The colors are sometimes lacking, even after adjusting the Picture settings. I also notice that the blacks aren’t as black as they should be, it sometimes has a washed out look to the picture. Not happy with that, but we get what we pay for, which is why I’m not rating it lower than I have, at least not yet. No dead pixels, and the resolution is really sharp. I watched Planet Earth II on Netflix last night and was really blown away by the colors, clarity and resolution. This tv was definitely made for that kind of show, or the other way around maybe. Really it was like watching a different tv, that’s how much different (better) it looked. Over-the-Air HDTV looks really good too. Maybe it’s just the shows I was watching earlier that left something to be desired in the picture quality, but I’m just kind of puzzled as to the difference between one show and the next with this tv.Anyway, I should mention also that I tried cancelling this order a short time after reading some comparisons between this model and a similar size TCL, but Best Buy couldn’t, or wouldn’t, cancel the order even though the request was put in before shipment. So that being said, I’d recommend buying direct from Amazon if you can help it, rather than purchasing from Best Buy as a third party via Amazon. Again though, I saw the deal on Prime Day and grabbed it quickly before doing my research. But for a 50” 4K UHD tv, I’m happy with the buy.The built-in Fire TV is also pretty awesome too. One remote for the whole shebang, rather than one for the TV and one for a Roku, which is what this tv replaced. Nice, clean interface, quick response. Go from streaming channels to over-the-Air channels with complete ease. Very happy with this aspect of the TV.Long story short, if you’re on a budget but want a nice entry level tv into 4K, this is a fine purchase. If you have a bigger budget to work with, do some comparison shopping first and read reviews, or go to a store and watch them side-by-side, like in the old days. :)",0

Regrettably the picture quality is lacking greatly; the images are not sharp and it took me a long time to find the right settings to live with it.

The remote is also the same as a fire stick with a few added buttons for convenience like a Netflix button that takes you right to Netflix. I have this setup in my kids’ room and the built in parental controls are great. My 6 and 4 year old both know how to use it and I feel safe that they aren’t watching things they shouldn’t.

We bought a 100.00 tv mount that supports 25inch-75inch TVs and can hold 100lbs. After researching which mounts were “compatible” for this tv, it isn’t compatible with mounts that it states are compatible with it. So if you plan on mounting this tv, it’s trial and error with mount after mount after mount. BUT other than that, this tv is perfect, you don’t need additional anything, the smart features keep you from having to plug a bunch of things into your tv and having a bunch of cords all over the place.

So i have a very old AppleTV overriding the new FireTV the majority of the time this TV is being used.  Dont waste your money on this TV if you ever plan to watch movies you already own.

Having worked for Samsung for a bit I can tell you that EVERY TV is different depending on who its sent to (Costco, Best Buy, WalMart, Abt etcetera) even if it has the same model number. Plus, models produced even a month apart can have subtle differences, usually improvements, that you have to consider before you purchase.

It said all is well in the settings and I did all the diagnostic tests I found on line. I am a retired tech support person from a HS. I ran a long Ethernet cable to the TV from my router and it connected. There was an update that was coming down that I found in the settings so I thought that might fix the issue.  It did not. The wireless card on the board must have died. I had a wireless extender I was using in the garage to extend signal there so I hooked it up to the TV through to Ethernet port. The problem was solved. The TV sees the extender as a Ethernet connection and overrides the WIFI.  Got this TV on sale for $99. The extender was around $30 so I am still under the price of the 32 inch on Amazon. So a 2 ft. CAT 5 cable and a WIFI extender will fix the wireless connectivity problem on this model. AT LEAST IT DID FOR ME!,0

The TV downloaded some updates and then started searching for the remote again.  I followed the steps I did with the Tech support guy, and nada.  Didn’t work.  Finally called tech support and they came up with some NEW dance moves to try.  When none of those planned out, she solemnly informed me that the TV was defective and should be returned.  I printed out the UPS label and then read the fine print; if it goes through UPS, I might have to pay part of the shipping.

Beside from being a very bad paperweight, the remote is also an ergonomic nightmare. If you try to press with one hand it sometimes will squirt out of your hand due to the rounded back. The wall mount screw plate is non-standard. I fortunately ordered one of those ""align your own holes"" mount kits so I got it mounted.

Sometimes I just want to turn the TV on and watch one of these handful of channels, which you wouldn't think is much to ask of a TV, but that's problematic for a few reasons: 1) There's no channel button or toggle on the accompanying remote, so you have to go through a silly process of toggling through the home menu and options to get to the channel you want instead of just pressing an ""up/down"" button between channels, 2) if you're having wifi or connectivity issues, which I frequently do at work, this TV basically becomes a useless box. I feel like I have to jump through hoops and options to get to ""live"" or ""non-smart"" content, 3) Similarly, if you get logged out of your Amazon account for whatever reason, you can't access anything - no apps, no live feed, which again makes this a purposeless box. I have a Fire Stick that I use with another TV at home with no issue, but I think there are issues specific with this integration.

","February 26, 2019",Yes,"I bought this as an ""upgrade"" for a 10 year old Toshiba set that's still working just fine and moved into my man cave.  I liked the clarity of the picture when it was working.  This set has had issue with the sound (cuts out for no reason and needs HDMI cable unplugged and plugged back in for it to return).  It started after a couple of weeks to randomly start crackling and then the picture would go out but seem to reset.  This lasted 60 days and now it turned itself off and won't turn back on.  I've contacted the seller and will update any changes as they happen. Update - - - Best Buy was excellent in replacing and handling the refund.  Unfortunately the replacement set (also a Toshiba Fire TV) had a very similar problem and I had to return it also.  Best Buy again was on top of it and within hours the refund was processing.  I chose a different brand of tv and hope it works better than this.I do NOT recommend this set !!! UPDATE!!! After changing out cables and tv sets I finally zeroed in on the root of the problem.  It appears my cable providers technology has been eclipsed by the tv capabilities and causes service problems.  I appreciate all Best Buy did, no questions asked"" to take care of my.

At first i think it just might be that specific app but then nothing else works either.My other complaint is that it shuts down completely after you don't use it for a certain amount of time. So if you go to get a snack or use the bathroom, make it short because you'll have to turn on, pick app, pick the show, and pick the episode every time. I hate it.

The sound quality is amazing and is loud! Which is good. The TV displays the colors of what you watch beautifully and its not all weird looking. I run my xbox 1 through the HDMI and I had no trouble setting it up. For a price of $229.99 you get a lot out of it.The only difficulties I had was starting up the TV and logging into Amazon Fire but that was only because the WiFi I have is really bad.

When you do turn it on it never resumes the last hdmi port you had set you have to select it all over again each darn time.So those are the things I would see fixed, auto resume when an HDMI port returns from a sleep state, return to the last used hdmi port when powered on and remove that diabolical LED.",0

(1) The television is no good for any hdmi device like a cable/satellite box, security monitor, or computer.  It has a setting to wake/start on most recent input, but it forgets that if it has been off for more than a few minutes.  Pointless setting.  Every time you turn it on, you have to use the remote to go through your home screen options to find the input, even if it is the only input you ever want.  every.  single.  time.  (2) a minor consideration is the remote is painful to use if you are even slightly arthritic.  do not get this television for an elderly person, they will hate the remote, it is too narrow and the main navigating button requires a surprising amount of force.  also, there is a android app that serves as a remote, but the app cannot be used if the television is off (so you can't turn it on) and has no power button (so you can't turn it off).The picture is good, as expected, if you are using it for the typical amazon/netflix/hulu streaming services those work fine too, and the stand is stable.  I feel if you have an alexa device that might offset the remote issue and maybe make the input issue minor (I don't have one, but maybe another alexa device would let you just say 'alexa turn on the television to input 1').

I have zero complaints on how to operate the TV. It was pretty simple right out of the box. Besides an update that it did upon hooking it up to our Wi-Fi, it probably took two minutes until I was watching something on it.

","February 19, 2019",Yes,"I did not buy this set from Amazon, but found it on sale locally.  Decided to take the plunge.  For the money, this TV really surprised me.  Blacks are black, whites are white.  Currently using it as a monitor for my PC.  Probably 2 or 3 feet away viewing distance.  It replaces a Toshiba 42LX177 which was a top of the line 1080p Toshiba when I bought it 10+ years ago (Price was $1600 I think then).  It trumps that TV in just about every category, which is to be expected though with the age of the older TV.When I initially hooked up this new Toshiba, I used my existing HDMI cable, and put the screen to 4k 60Hz, it worked for a good half of the day, then started to give me garbled lines and blips in and out from a black screen.  The TV even rebooted on its own during this.  I thought for sure the TV was faulty.  Turns out, I just needed a 4k 60Hz capable HDMI cable.  I picked this up:  https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078LTNDZW/  and I havent had an issue since.  Its also a little clearer with the new cable.  I have a feeling the old cable was just picking up interference every now and then and was not 4k 60Hz capable.Only complaint I have with this TV is the actual TV settings, which are integrated into the Fire TV interface, this makes adjusting colors/brightness only available in the Fire TV menu, so you cannot adjust in real time while in an APP or on a specific input.  However the color/brightness is pretty well balanced out of the box.  This is still something others have complained about.  Also othes have complained about the wireless in the TV, mine seems solid at this time.  including a picture of a speedtest from the firefox browser in the TV.Although I worry about the longevity of this TV after reading some of the reviews.  Hopefully it lasts a while.  For what I paid so far, I am very happy with the purchase.  Having a cable that specifically supports 4k 60Hz solved the problems I initially experienced.",0

First the internal audio stopped working, but since I feed the audio via fiber to a real sound system, that wasn't a deal killer.  Then this evening, HDMI 1 stopped working and I had to move my Roku to HDMI2, which worked for less then an hour then, so sound.  And no sound from anything, including built in apps.  Finally I turned off the setting that lets you control it with other remotes and the sound came back on.  I spent 1 1/2 hours with both amazon tech support and toshiba.  As we were getting going with toshiba, they cut me off and by the time I wended my way back, their tech support was closed for the evening.  In years gone by, I was a big toshiba fan, but this is not how things should work.  It mostly looks like a software bug, but getting someone to do something seems impossible.",1

I found the setup for this set to be a little cumbersome and I don’t see other people with less experience having the patience to try different things to get it setup. One thing that is particularly annoying is when you first power on it forces you to try an immediate update. Do yourself a favor and skip this step!! Get the inputs labeled, hook up cable boxes, streaming devices, game consoles, etc and then hook up to a wireless network, download the update and walk away and leave it be for ten minutes. Now that it is setup I’m very happy with it. The picture (once properly adjusted) is clear, looks great and if you have a Fire Stick the layout is almost identical.

","January 11, 2020",Yes,"I've thought about this review for a while now. Everything I'm about to describe should have the caveat ""for the price"" attached to it.I thought I was buying a smart TV with Amazon Fire integration. It's more like I bought and Amazon device with a 50"" screen attached. That's not really a bad thing.  I'll break it down.1: Picture. This TV replaces an older Toshiba 50"" 1080P that I've had for a few years. The difference in the picture is dramatic. I'm not a gamer so I can't speak to things like latency or speed, and I have seen better 4k pictures. The black isn't as true, the corners are just slightly less-than, etc. Considering the caveat I mentioned earlier I'm very happy. 4.5 stars.2: Remote. I'd been using a Fire TV Stick before this. The included remote that comes with the TV is familiar and easy to learn. However, it feels cheap. It's hard to say how, it just isn't as solid in my hand. Alexa works well. There are 4 shortcut buttons at the bottom. I call them gimmick buttons. I guess if you have all four of the preset apps it could be useful. 2.5 stars.3: Sound. Wow! Over the years I've become accustomed to the sound from flat screen TV's being thin with not great volume. My previous TV would need to be at 25 or higher to listen comfortably. This new one? 9 is *loud* and it has pretty solid bass response for TV speakers. Very impressed. 5.5 stars.4: Fire integration. This is my bedroom TV so I don't have other devices connected. I'm also a cord cutter. My last TV I'd have to switch inputs and remotes to watch local in my digital antenna. Not so now! My antenna channels appear in a channel guide along with my Pluto channels. I can hide channels I don't want and add favorites. Pretty cool. It could benefit from a more traditional remote however, having to go through all those channels with the scroll wheel can be time consuming. Still.. that caveat, right? All other Fire TV functions work as expected. 5.5 stars.I've read some reviews of TV's failing, dropping networks, etc. It made me a little bit nervous to buy one. While I've only had mine for about a month now everything is working great. For everything it had you really can't beat it *for the price*.",0

It literally took its last breathe the day the Toshiba arrived.  Very easy to set up and lightweight so that one person can manage.  Easy to mount the base for the TV, worst part was getting to the power outlet stuffed way back behind the large hutch.  Ports are easy to access, and aren't tucked behind, they are on the side making it easy to pop in/out device connections.  Cable coax like any other TV I've dealt with is in the back, and DIFFICULT to start threading, mostly as the cable connection ""sleeve"" is wider now, than a few years ago.Took a bit to get all registered/setup/updated but once done, I was then ready to try to access my cable.  This part was not as straight forward as it could be, but I eventually figured out navigation to output settings.  Trained my cable providers remote to do basic functions (on/off, and HDMI setting to reach cable)-- the only bummer when that using cable providers remote is not being able to access settings like sleep timer, but I'll live with that and maybe one day I'll have time to find a way to hack cable providers remote to reach Toshiba's sleep timer..Picture quality is awesome and sound is great (especially when compared to my prior TV).  My cable plan includes some of the same apps included with Fire, but there are others that on a rainy day, I'll peruse.  Having a constant inet connection should keep these as well as firmware updates current, so no sitting an waiting, waiting, waiting for updates that will only run once you turn on older model TVs that don't hold a good connection w/inet.i haven't tried out Alexa yet, mostly as when I'm watching / using, I'm heading off to dream time... maybe one day though. Should be able to accept screencasting or remote projection from a laptop, but haven't tried that -- because of the landscape width, I'm not sure how these would behave, but most of today's technology plays fairly well together.

They aren't intrusive, but there is something wrong with spending hundreds of dollars to still have ads.-Remote is of the point and click variety. Was hoping for a Bluetooth connection similar to the firestick.So I've been a firestick user for years. The firestick is good for one reason and one reason alone: It runs a version of stock Android. Those of you that understand what goes into internet TV can understand why that might be useful. I've never been impressed with the features or responsiveness of the firestick.Then I bought a Fire Tablet. I had to sell it. The version of Android on that tablet is absolutely atrocious compared to anything Google has ever released.So needless to say, I didn't have high expectations for this TV's software. But I do want a stock Android experience so I got it.I'm blown away by how impressive this is. Responsive, and the feature list is outstanding. If you value a stock Android experience (internet browser + third party apps), look no further.There may be better value TV's out there if you don't care so much about the kind of smart TV software that you are getting.

","February 15, 2019",Yes,"The hardware portion of this devices is build with cost in mind, there are understandable trade offs for it's price.  If the software was just built cheap I would give this 5/5 for price/quality (I accept cost limitations in inexpensive devices).  It's the software that I don't find understandable here.  The machine uses a 4core 1.7Ghz processor... it should be able to do more.  Streaming from a mobile device to a TV is something I can do easily with a huge host of other devices but with the Fire TV it's not just broken but appears to be intentionally hamstrung.  Amazon, FireOS needs more work, it's looking more and more crippled next to vanilla Android installs.",0

Smart features are great and the interface is pretty snappy not much lag at all that I can notice unlike amazon fire sticks/ Roku sticks. TV is a bit on the thick side but what do you expect with a $100 Price tag lol. Picture quality is really good with 720p, at 32 inches you really don’t need 4K or even 1080p. The benefit of the lower resolution is a much better refresh rate. My only very minor complaint was the delayed shipping but this item was fulfilled through Best Buy, and with all the units I’m sure they sold on prime day it’s completely understandable.

","March 2, 2019",Yes,"I’m giving this TV five stars, due to the value of features offered at its $200 price.It’s a basic 4K tv, nothing special. The picture quality is good when viewing it from the center, but really starts to wash out when you move to the sides and increase the angle. I knew this when I purchased it for a smaller spare bedroom in our house. So, I would not recommend this for a larger room with wide seating.I’m most pleased with the Fire TV interface. While I’m not new to Amazon, I had never used their Fire TV equipment. It’s easy to navigate and the Alexa voice option on the remote is great. We are Playstation Vue subscribers, and the TV guide within the Fire TV platform seamlessly integrates with it (there’s even a button on the remote for PlayStation Vue). The ease of this platform actually encouraged me to purchase a standalone 4K stick for my living room tv, in efforts to provide one common platform for my family to use. However, I did notice that the Fire Tv interface on this TV doesn’t have all the features of the full stick, like equipment control features for the remote control.  So, not sure of it will integrate with sound bars and other equipment directly through the remote. Not a big deal for a spare bedroom, but maybe for you.Once again, great budget TV for spare bedroom with lots of value for the price. It has its limitations, as long as your aware of them. Since it’s relatively new and it doesn’t get watched much, I don’t have many comments on life span.",0

There are two stands (or a wall mount if you went with one) and you have all of 4 screws needed to set it up. The manual is clear and helpful in not only installing the stands but the wall mount as well.As for the actual TV, the picture quality is wonderful. Like many others say, sound quality is okay, but I am far from an audiophile and admit that on occasion there it is difficult to hear what is said in spoken dialogue. Alexa works perfectly for me and has no trouble understanding my voice even with a somewhat thick french Canadian accent thrown into the mix. The settings a fairly average, with no unusual settings that you wouldn't see on any other TV.I would emphasize that the settings are incredibly easy to figure out and many other reviews mention issues that can be solved easily within 5 minutes of opening the settings menu. Things like turning on the TV and having it open to a specific input are entirely possible. I will also say that the TV seems incredibly fragile and that you should be careful setting it up, but there are instructions on proper removal and setup included in the box and following them should be more than enough to keep it safe. Finally, the TV does require a short boot when turning it on, but it takes all of a few seconds and honestly if the speed bothers you then a smart TV probably isn't your thing anyway.All in all, if you follow the directions, be careful with the TV, and take 10 to 15 minutes to set it up properly in the settings menu this is a great purchase.

It is a damn shame that amazon limits its app choices. It seems like it is doing the same thing as Apple Appstore. I have an iPad and iPhone and apple has been from the beginning done this since they started out. And Amazon is doing this too. Such a shame because you are no better than Apple. You are the same.

I still really like the TV but there is a problem with the remotes that come with this tv, after my remote started acting up, I started looking around and there are a lot of people who bought this tv with the same issues.  I thought it was just a little glitchy at first because my issues weren't as bad as others have reported but then my remote stopped working all together.  Super annoying that the remote doesn't work because there are no controls on the actual tv and if you're lucky to pair your phone or tablet to the tv you can use the app as a remote but flipping through youtube or netflix using the phone remote gets real old fast.  You can buy a replacement remote but you have to make sure it's the right one, with Amazon naming everything the same that isn't compatible makes ordering something as simple as the remote a challenge, besides the real issue is that a remote should last longer than my underwear!Love this tv... not ideal for cable users, but is great for internet services and over the air tv. I would recommend this tv to anyone who likes to use net based tv watching!",0

The picture isn't as crisp as others I seen on different brands and size. The sound is abysmal with no bass and the tremble gets weird when on full volume. The smart function acts dumb most times. It will randomly disconnects from the wifi. Hdmi imputs, sometimes I have to unplug my ps4 hdmi to the t.v and plug it back in so the picture will show up sometimes when I first turn on my console. A lot of flaws and regrets. The alexa feature works how'd you expect it. You say what you want to look for and it'll get it right but rarely it mistakes what you said. The t.v's return to home feature stopped working on the remote and on my app, which leads me to believe it's a software problem with that issue.

Picture may not be as sharp and vibrant as other tv brands like samsung or lg but it’s still  pretty good especially after tweaking it in settings. Smart capabilities are really nice, fire os is a type of android so it’s pretty flexible. You can even installed 3rd party apps which is nice of you are into that. Built-in alexa is working pretty good too. But still couldn’t figure out to integrate with my echo dot yet. On the alexa app on my iphone toshiba brand doesn’t show up, weird.The packaging was well done. It comes in un branded rectangle box, and inside the actual tv box. So the first box is providing another layer of protection. I guess best buy learnt its lesson after all those damaged units.Price/performance ratio is I think pretty decent and it worths.Overall I think it’s pretty decent upgrade to 4K if you don’t  have already.

Our household is fairly ignorant to TVs and TV brands so when we saw the box that said ""Insignia"" on it, we foolishly assumed that Insignia was some sort of subsidiary of Toshiba and that was the reason the box didn't say Toshiba.  We opened the box and set it up and the TV worked/works fine, but after a bit I googled Insignia and discovered that it's actually a Best Buy brand.We paid $280 for what we thought was a Toshiba and ended up getting an Insignia TV which lists on Amazon currently for $250.Because we had already opened the box and set up the TV, we decided that we weren't took keen on going through all the effort of reboxing and figuring out how to return the TV in order to get the Toshiba.  We made a request to the seller to simply credit us $30 since we paid 280 for a TV worth 250.  The seller refused.  I don't know exactly how to even figure out WHO the seller is but they identified themselves as ""SD"" at the end of their email and their email address is :  8dnw69c6zzr3wqn@marketplace.amazon.comIn fairness, they were willing to allow us to return the set, but the process seemed fairly involved and we were already i guess comfortable with the Insignia set that we had set up.  Perhaps this is a scam where they figure most won't bother to return or perhaps it was a simple error on their part, but we were disappointed that they weren't willing to simply credit the $30 price difference to make things fair.So in the end we got the wrong TV (although the same inches and resolution) and we paid $30 more for the Insignia set than the current going rate on Amazon!  Not a great experience but I just admit the Insignia is working fine and much better than what we had before.",0

But I bought it anyways because I just needed a TV nothing fancy and figured since I wasnt shopping for Top of The Line quality it would be fine. But its not fine, its a pcs of crap. Spend the extra money and get something worth it. Since day 1 this TV has not only been slow loading - whatever you intend to watch you better start 10 min prior because it takes that long to load channels... Not that bad once you get used to it, I could even deal with that. BUT also half the time it doesn't even power on at all. You select your show and blank black screen, never loads. I watch alot of sports and have constantly missed the 1st 30min of them due to this and thats if it ever powers on and loads. Ive missed full hr shows messing around just trying to get anything on, after 1 hr of trying I usually give up and find another activity vs TV time. Sometimes if you unplug it and reboot it you MAY get to watch TV but that doesnt even always work. So if your looking for a large black paper weight nick nack to stare at buy this. If you actually intend to watch TV or see any picture of any kind then Do not buy this. Wish Id of listened to being sceptical.",0

The instructions show what should be in the box for a 39 and a 43 inch, and not one of the three comes with the screws necessary to mount the TV to the wall. There are screws to mount the feet, but not for wall mounting. I'm sure the set works fine, but it's currently useless to me until I make a trip to the hardware store. The TV I bought is the same brand, but it is an older TV, and has a different mounting pattern, let alone screws. With sets being as large and weightless as they are, mounting them to the wall is the safest way to keep them. I can't believe Best Buy would bother selling a device that you can't hang out of the box, or why Amazon would want to install their software on it. I know it seems like a small gripe, but how hard is it to put 4 more screws in the box.I may change my rating once I get the TV functional. But for now, this smart TV is the complete opposite!UPDATE: I went out and bought the screws the instructions said I would need to hang my TV and they worked perfectly. The TV works as expected, but still, how hard would it be to include these in the box. Better yet, just screw them into the back of the set. You could probably charge $5 more and no one would care.I changed my review from a 2 to a 4 star review because the TV is exactly what I wanted, needed and expected, but I can't give it a 5 without the screws needed to hang the TV.",0

Within the first week after using this TV, I experienced volume issues where I would turn the TV on, and there would be absolutely no sound. To fix this, I just turned it off and walked away for a few hours. After this happened more than 3 times, I finally contacted technical support, who told me to do a hard reset and forced me to redo all the the initial setup and logins. After asking what I should do if this happens again, they said to do another hard reset. Do they think this will solve everything? Redoing the initial setup and login every few weeks?Another issue with the volume is that maybe every 1 in 4 times I turn on the TV, the volume is extremely loud. My volume is usually set to around 6 or 7, but when this issue happens, I have to turn the TV down to 1 or 2 to listen comfortably. It doesn't happen every time, but it does still occur and is frankly super annoying when the TV starts blasting unexpectedly.Last issue I routinely have is that the apps freeze. It's happened for my two most watched apps: Netflix and Hulu, probably what most viewers use as well. My only fix is to, again, walk away for a few hours and watch later. It's made me so mad that I'll just turn off the TV and watch on my laptop. What's the use of a TV if it doesn't work?This Toshiba is absolute trash.

I wish the remote functioned like a regular remote rather than a bluetooth smart one, and that the TV actually turned off instead of going to sleep.

Now if only it opened straight to an input, instead of into the Fire TV interface... I could save myself the 60 seconds of watching my TV scroll way past the inputs / recents section...One last thing, isn't it irritating that I have to scroll past a giant banner ad to get to my TV inputs???

So I ended up sticking with DirectTV.  Had I known I wouldn't have purchased the TV, even tough it was a great deal.",0
5.0,"Perfect TV for the Price
  
","December 6, 2018",Yes,"After finding a killer deal on here for this TV I decided to give it a go, upgrading from a 32"" Samsung 1080p. Outside of receiving a defective TV like many of the reviewers seem to have, I don't see how you couldn't love this.-The picture: Upgrading from an HD to UHD I was expecting a high quality image that was noticeably different from my previous TV. This Toshiba completely delivers on this front. The picture was crystal clear, the contrast was excellent, and the motion was smooth as butter.-The sound: The sound is strong, vibrant, and will get VERY loud if that's what you really want. I have yet to test it playing music, but from what I have experienced through watching shows on it I fully expect it will still sound great.-The interface: I could not be more pleased with the Fire TV interface. I have used a Fire stick plugged into my TV for the last 3 years and I was pretty disappointed with it. It was glitchy and slow and all around kind of a pain. While I wasn't thrilled with my Fire stick I do love the Fire platform as someone who doesn't own a TV subscription but streams from Netflix, Hulu, etc. I was hoping that with the ability to use an ethernet cable and the Fire TV being built in it would run better, and boy was I right.  It is very responsive and I love the ability to go directly to Netflix when the TV is off just by pushing the Netflix button. I'm not thrilled that the two partner buttons that do the same thing are Playstation Vue and HBO as I don't use either, BUT, overall I am very pleased with the Fire TV.-The materials: It's quite clear that you get what you pay for. Don't get my wrong, I don't think the TV will be falling apart any time soon, but having previously owned a Samsung the difference in quality is quite clear. The screen is made out of a cheaper material and seems more fragile, and it is fairly bulky for being an LED TV. If there's nothing broken when you get it I wouldn't worry about it, but I now understand why so many reviewers have had issues receiving broken TVs. I would not recommend this TV for people with anger management issues as anything thrown at the screen will surely destroy it. With that being said, the TV works beautifully and I didn't expect it to be made from the best quality materials given what I paid for it.Overall, if you can get this TV on any kind of discount it is most definitely worth the purchase.",0

There are times where the TV remains on, but since the remote isn’t functional there is no way to watch the TV. I even downloaded the FireTV app and even then it’s malfunctioning.

I did buy the Extended Warranty just in case but noticed it DOES NOT start AFTER the 1yr Factor Warranty ends, so technically it’s only 3 extra years and not 4. Also, for people who buy this because it’s 4K, if you don’t have something to produce a 4K picture/signal, i.e, cable box, game console, then don’t expect much difference from a 1080p TV. It’s still a good picture though with great sound and the apps are good for people without a cable subscription, like me, but make sure you have a 4K source to get the most from the resolution.

Unfortunately when it does this, the tv no longer detects my wifi which is very annoying.After having to reset the tv to factory settings the first time, which fixed it but then I had to reinstall all my apps, I called toshiba for assistance.

Plug the tv back in and use the remote to turn it on.This has worked for me the past few times it has disconnected from my wifi.My advice would be to maybe look for a better  tv.

We knew the reason behind the ridiculous price was going to be that it's an Amazon TV &amp; it would have the sub-par Alexa crap &amp; probably have ads but we had no idea the extent to which this thing would suck. Connecting other devices to it is annoying to say the least, changing inputs is not streamlined whatsoever. It's SUPER laggy and the apps are always crashing on the smart TV itself so the difficulty changing inputs is really annoying. Now, let's talk about the ADS! Yes, we should always expect smart devices to be listening to us and advertising to us but this TV feels like a new level of invasion. Every time you turn your TV on, you're getting advertised to watch an Amazon show or buy an Amazon product.

","March 6, 2019",Yes,"I feel like most people now see ""4k"" and immediately assume amazing quality picture. This is not the case for this TV.

Compared to my 65"" Samsung in the living room (granted, &gt;$800 TV vs a &lt;$300 TV) the Toshiba is garbage. Picture quality is extremely bad, and there practically nothing you can do to the display settings can improve it. Trust me, I've spent hours trying. Even Rtings.com has nothing. Also sound quality is terrible. I bring the PS4 into my room once in a while and every time I do I immediately regret bringing out of the living room while I simultaneously regret purchasing this TV. I watch a lot of NBA as well, and the picture is always grainy and washed out and just generally not appealing.I also constantly have to restart the TV to get certain apps (Netflix, Sling) to work properly. Even 4k content looks generally bad, like washed out and over-processed 1080p. The only reason why I'm not giving this one star is that you get what you pay for, and I probably expected too much from this TV. If you just want a large Smart TV to watch The Office on Netflix and nothing more, then I'm sure this TV would do the trick.",0

Setup was a breeze.You can change the home screen to last used so it will come back with your tv screen instead of the Amazon screen after shutting it off.If you put the audio sound setting to enhanced bass it’s a lot better.

This happened for every television show or episode we tried watching, almost without fail. Infuriating, and made watching anything on the SmartTV impossible. I wouldn't have been opposed to just using this as a plain old TV to just play everything off of my playstation - but the SmartTV functionality is something you constantly need to interact with in order to access anything on the TV itself.

It is a very close relative of the Android TV system which means many good Android  apps (close to 85% of the  Apps I tried worked fine) can be easily installed.2. Use something like ES Explorer you can easily browse contents on any computer on the local nework.  This means you can install apps apks and watch downlowded videos which makes this TV behaves very much like a samll PC.3. Can install other App Markets to supplement contents or usefullness.  For example, I install the Dongbei Market which is geared towards Chinese audience.  I am sure there are other alternate markets out there for different language regions.4. Can easily installed VPN software (good ones are paid) to bypass region blocks contents.5. Although there is a rift between Google and Amazon which made Youtube the victim.  This means you will have trouble running the native Youtube app on this TV.  I have found a adequete alternative via the use the Puffin Browser where you can run youtube as a web site. Not great for searching content but you will be able to easily watch all you prescription Youtube channels on this TV.5.I connect an old laptop to the TV via one of the HDMI port.  This means I can run many Windows based software on the TV.  This is not for everyone.  But every once in a while a Windows based software  can make this TV very versatile.  Also any old laptops (mine was a 14 inch Dell fourth gen i5 based work notebook) can blocks around any TV or TV boxes.There are many other things that I do with this TV such as shopping, music, cooking aide, home security etc.  With the 6 above mentioned features, the possibilities are endless. I basically use this TV like I would use my Android phone.  For those Android users, you will find this TV's eco system very familiar.  In conclusion, it is a great Smart TV. and obviously I hope it doesnt break easily like some users have experienced but I will not be too upset when the day comes.",0

When i bought this tv i was not expecting much from the internal fire tv platform and planned on using my Nvidia shield as the main IP platform. To my surprise,and delight, the fire tv platform is working much better than expected.All of the apk's that i have on my other boxes were able to be loaded on the fire tv with just a few minutes of watching YouTube to figure it out. My internet provided cable service, which cost $5 a month for every channel you can imagine was very easy to ""side load"". One of the best features that is included on this tv is the live television built in with connecting a Hd Antenna. I live about 8 miles from Pittsburgh and with just a $15 window antenna i receive 30 over the air (OTA)  channels and there is a built in guide for the channels that we receive. If you are considering being a ""cord cutter"" please realize you still need an internet provider and make sure you get a fast internet speed so buffering is minimized. The color on this television to me is great coming from what i had before. If you want a cinematic experience you are not getting it with a sub $400 television but this is great for our family with light gaming, medium movie watching,and a lot of television watching.

They also run commercials for very adult Prime programming before and after content aimed at kids like Annoying Orange.  Annoying Orange is PG13 but really it’s aimed at younger kids and the content is not kid safe.  You can set up parental controls but since no kids section to limit what they can see Prime offers (they can see thumbnails for content they need the code to watch) I have a daily fight about what my son can ask cannot watch.  He is constantly asking me for the code and it would be much easier if they just had a kids section like Netflix.,0

After trying those options I went to a real hardware store, McFadden Dale, even there the best I could do was M4 x 30 which is a little over a 1/4 inch too short.  Amazon has a pack of M4 x 40 for about $6, so I have 36 left over if anyone wants to wall mount!  I am not a fan of the mickey mouse feet provided either as previous sets had weighted feet that helped keep the CG low to prevent tipping and could be anchored with screws in case of an earthquake.

I had to make a trip to Home Depot to complete the mounting install.

This started 2 weeks after I got the TV.It is a pain to actually troubleshoot with the provided device remote, since the remote intermittently works I find myself using the FireTV app on my phone more often.There was also an annoying audio sync issue between the FireTV and my AppleTV that I eventually resolved by restoring both to factory.All in all the experience has been sub-par. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯",0

","February 1, 2019",Yes,"The TV works very well and has access to all major streaming apps as promised. The only problem is that the remote, which is specifically designed for this tv, ALWAYS lags behind when you press any buttons. This means it is impossible to tell if you've hit ""back"" or ""Home"" or ""Volume Up/Down"" etc until about 5-10 seconds after you press button. It has taken me out of apps and interrupted viewing on several occasions.  Also, despite the Alexa enabled tv, the voice remote cannot set a sleep timer... seems like a simple thing to fix, but that is more personal preference so it doesn't affect my rating of this product.",0

Sure, it only takes maybe a minute to restart it, but why do I have to do this? I imagine Toshiba makes good TVs, but try not to buy a FireTV...from anyone.

The direction to put it together (even putting the feet on) were terrible but if you've ever assembled a TV then it won't be a problem. Product is great, they need a new technical writer for the directions.",0

","November 29, 2018",Yes,As soon as I powered up the tv I noticed there was a dark band in the right side of the image. Most noticeable when the program has a lighter color background.

","August 30, 2019",Yes,I really like that this TV was easy to set up and has a great picture quality.

","May 17, 2019",Yes,"So everything on this TV is great, except that certain channels have some perimeter feedback that gets broadcast ans distorts the picture along the edge.

","January 6, 2020",Yes,"I got what I paid for. The tv claims to be 4K but it doesn’t look like it. I’m assuming it’s based of your Internet ? My room is also quite cold and could also be the reason why it takes a min to start up or to even load up the show I was on. The internet router is in the same room and never seems to be an issue for my cellphone or consoles that run on WiFi. So I don’t know why the frames like trash. Other than that this tv does everything it claims to be capable off.

It will work perfect for while and you have to reboot.
