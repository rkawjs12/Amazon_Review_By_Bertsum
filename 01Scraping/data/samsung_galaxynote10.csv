5.0,"One of the few phones worth it's crazy price
  
","August 25, 2019",No,"SMARTPHONE INTROI've been buying the latest and greats smartphones since the early HTC days and have owned just about every significant Samsung smartphone release since then. Every year I will stray over to other manufacturers to see what the big and small players are up to. Most, but not all of the time, I find myself right back to my Samsung phone as the daily driver. Which is usually a Note. Now that Samsung has released another Note series for an increasingly high price, let's see how it does. In particular against my Note 9 that it's replacing.PROS:+ Excellent build quality+ The high-resolution OLED display somehow looks even better than before+ Superfast performance; zero lag+ Much improved speakers that you can *feel*+ The bezels continue to disappear; nearly all-screen+ Core functions, such as phone calls, still work great+ Lots of internal storage + expandable storage+ Generous battery that truely lasts all-day+ Fast wired and wireless charging for those very heavy phone usage days+ The ever-useful stylus continues to evolve+ 3 Camera Lenses for any scenario+ Great picture &amp; video quality with some useful featuresCONS:- Hole punch camera is distracting- The in-screen fingerprint reader takes a few steps back from the physical sensor- RIP headphone jack- Price keeps going upDESIGNCompared to the Galaxy Note 9, the Galaxy Note 10+ feels much more substantial than I expected. It has more heft and somehow even more solid feel to it. In particular with the Samsung OEM cases. Which are also expensive, but continue the high-quality impression of what you are holding in the hand.The left side has the volume up/down and power button. The bottom is USB-C port and stylus holder. The rest of the phone is fairly clean and simple. I prefer power on the right, but it's easy enough to get used to after a few hours. I opted for the white version to mix things up and I like it. It still provides a nice high-end look all while resisting visible fingerprints (and probably scratches) than most darker and shinier colors.Even with a 6.8"" display, it's still roughly the same size as the Note 9. There is now simply less bezel. But due to the squared corners, it never feels small. If you aren't already used to large phones, this will take some getting used to. And as manufacturers continue to slowly push the size of phones combined with no more bezels to shrink, this is probably about as large as I expect a mainstream phone to go. Any further and folks are going to have issues.SOFTWARELong ago this used to be Samsung's weakest point. They'd throw lots of half-baked features with no optimization, resulting in lots of lag and bloat. Those days are long gone. Samsung nailed that down with the Galaxy S9/Note 9 series. Except with the Note 10, it's even faster, and smoother. Which I suspect much credit goes toward the Snapdragon 855.I should note that I am a fan of Google's Android Experience. But every time I jump over to a Google phone (or another brand), I immediately start to miss all of the small but very useful features Samsung has built into their phone. The game launcher, scene optimizer, multiple lenses, display quality, high-end specs, etc.And honestly, after easily disabling Bixby, there isn't that much bloat. Disable/Remove a few random apps like Facebook and I'm good to go.PERFORMANCEAs noted above, the performance is absolutely fantastic. Usually while going through initial setup or installing apps, these phones tend to get very laggy. This was probably the only time I saw a hint of lag, but surprisingly minimal. In that, I could easily and quickly perform other tasks while downloading and installing apps, games, music, etc.Each year as performance increases, the need for synthetic benchmarks decrease. I think they still serve a purpose in limited use-cases for a ""reliable"" baseline. But today, I'm not going to bother. This phone is fast and can do everything you want.DISPLAY &amp; AUDIOThe 6.8"" WQHD+ Dynamic AMOLED display combined with some significantly improved speakers are simply the best upgrades from previous phones. Watching high-resolution content on YouTube or Netflix look and sound fantastic. I found myself glued to the screen during my demo session with various clips.Even the icons on the desktop almost pop from the screen. As though they are right there touching your fingers.The speakers finally have some force behind them as well. Allowing you to ""feel"" the vibrations in your hand. And yes, they are quite loud. With Atmos-enabled they provide a great stereo separation effect.I'll also mention there is an included screen protected. It's very thin but it's quite unobtrusive. I usually remove these. But since it virtually covers the entire screen and provides a smooth swiping experience, I'll leave it for now.And last I'll briefly mention the hole punch as it does have a negative impact with the multimedia experience. Anytime there is a bright scene around that area, my eyes are immediately drawn to it. This needs go away sooner rather than later.CAMERASAs the camera count increases, so too does the usefulness, functionality, and flexibility. The rear now has a 16MB ultra-wide camera, 12MP wide-angle camera (normal), and 12MP telephoto camera. The introduction of wide-angle is super useful and one I use very often. Each camera captures excellent pictures.I told my Pixel 3 and don't have it for comparison today. Are there better cameras available? I'm sure there are. But unless you are really comparing back-to-back, I doubt you'd notice. In particular, if you like to record video. That's one area the Pixel and some other phones don't do as well. The stability and clarity when recording 4K @ 60fp is excellent. Combined with solid audio recording and you've got a great overall camera package.I'm not into selfies, but that 10MP camera is somewhat mandatory these days. It's unfortunate it has resulted in a small but very noticeable hole in the screen. Which as noted above, is absolutely noticeable. In either case, it takes solid pictures as well. No complaints there.FINGERPRINT READERUnfortunately, there is another negative feature change. With the Galaxy Note 9, and virtually every other phone with a physical reader, you can just rest your finger and quickly unlock/wake your phone. With Samsung's implementation of the in-screen reader, you have to press firmly and wait a second for it to register. And if it doesn't read your fingerprint right away, it may be a few seconds or repeated attempts.If the screen is turned on, it does tend to be quicker. But you still need to press firmly and wait longer than in the past. I'm really hoping a software update improves this. Otherwise, I may just go back to the power button and a pin.DEX &amp; ""YOUR PHONE""There are a lot of other software features, but I did want to highlight these two as they are unique and stand out for me. I got used to Dex with my last Samsung phone. And there continue to be minor but useful improvements. Dex is surprisingly useful if you want to do some light work. When I'm on-the-go I can easily plug in a USB-C to HDMI cable, Bluetooth keyboard/mouse and have a portable desktop experience. You can also now use a normal USB cable and windows app to access Dex, it's just not ideal for games and multimedia.I've got personal and work e-mail, browser, youtube, office apps, and a range of other tools. I don't need to do video or photo editing on the go. And I found this can meet just about any task I need or want to do while traveling. This is a little more useful on a tablet, but in a different way, as the keyboard is already included. Less to travel with.And then there is the new Your Phone feature. This is a little more ""early stage"" in development, but still handy. Just plug in a USB cable to any Windows PC and you can mirror what's on your phone. You also have direct access to messages, but the mirror function is nice. You can interact with your phone, on the PC. All while charging it.I'd like to see more dedicated ports into this app. But being able to see and respond to any notification is great. Just don't expect to play games or smoothly stream youtube.THE PHONEThat's right, this is still a phone. And as such, it needs to make phone calls! And other core functions. As I use this for both personal and work, this is a critical but often overlooked feature. While it may feel like more of a check-box item, I've had more than a few phones over the years that still fail in this arena.I'm pleased to report that phone calls and text are excellent. Speakerphone works well. No issues with hearing anybody and vice versa. The radios appear to be good quality. Bluetooth is reliable as well as wi-fi, which is very fast. I'm easily pushing 300-400Mbps up/down with my Google Mesh Wireless network.CONCLUSIONSo how exactly do you justify a $1,100 phone? Honestly, you really don't justify it. At least not in the traditional sense. My Note 9 would have continued to serve me well for another year. But we buy these phones because they're interesting, they entertain us, and they make life a little bit easier. And considering the significant percentage of time many of us spend on these portable gadgets, it starts to make sense that we want to allocate more budget towards them.While it's not perfect (no phone is), I still believe Samsung has enough features, functionality, quality, and performance for me to ""justify"" the Galaxy Note 10+'s price and keep it as my daily driver for another year. I'll still grab a few more phones that intrigue me between now and the Note 11, but I'd be surprised if they truly replaced this one. If they can, I'd welcome it.",417
5.0,"Sorry
  
","September 9, 2019",Yes,"My New Note 10+ arrived Tuesday Morning.  Having Owned The Note 1, Note 2, Note 4, Note 7 (for a few hours before it was recalled), and the Note 8, I had more than a few expectations. After 6 days of ownership, i can honestly say every expectation was meet or exceeded. Battery Life unbelievable. Screen excellent. Included software, great. Have used it on both Verizon &amp; AT&amp;T with no problems. Not expecting any problems in Europe in a few weeks, in multiple countries, with 2 more service provider's SIMs  With 512GB built in, and my installed 512GB Micro SD Card, I can carry with me every document, every picture, every video that i want to not only for areas without or high priced Wi-Fi, but also as a secure backup for my small business files. So Why am I sorry?  I am sorry for the external battery sellers - I don't need to carry one with me. Sorry that I have purchased multiple QC3 vehicle chargers. Don't need most of them.  Almost sorry I have 3 tablets, 2 at offices, 1 at home. Have not quite given those up, but they may end up for sale.  Is the phone overpriced? Of course it is, however it is something I use virtually every waking hour.  Extremely pleased with it!",214

","August 26, 2019",Yes,"I'll keep this short, phone is great and all but moving from the Rog phone to this one is super hard, and this is mainly because the refresh rate 120 back to 60 is actually kind of straining on the eyes now ( eyes are kind of sensitive). Besides this everything else is great, oh and if you don't like the hole punch in the middle because of video watching there is like this semi full screen mode that just black bars the side and it's great, but 60hz on a $1200 phone hurts the soul.",90
4.0,"Good phone, not great...box had been opened
  
","September 7, 2019",Yes,"Slightly concerned as the box had been opened before getting to me. The phone seems to be new from everything I can tell, but that took some of my excitement away...not knowing for sure if someone had handled the phone prior to me. The sticker that is usually on the back of the phone was not present...you could see where it had been. The phone is quite nice, although not sure it's worth 1200 bucks. The camera is not really what the YouTube reviewers say it is...it does a lot of softening to faces...even with beauty mode turned off. Not sure if I'm keeping the phone after all of the above...still deciding.",82

One of the features I upgraded for from the note 8.  Basic features were fine it's a good phone but I bought it for a camera upgrade.  Just a waste of time I just plan to return..what if the next one has another problem?  Oh the pictures were not much improved.,68

It takes awesome pictures, it is buttery smooth in terms of speed, the pen features improved (however, it is smaller).  Everyone is jealous because of the screen size and capabilities.The only downside to the phone is the fact it is north of $1000 pushing towards the $1500 once you get the 512 GB Storage, the 512GB SD Card, Insurance and an OtterBox Defender!As a consolation prize, Amazon was cool to throw in one of those nifty 2nd Gen Echo Plus that was tied into it as a promotion.

","September 23, 2019",Yes,"first, the transfer of information from old phone to new phone was unclear as you have to connect to WiFi to do so, except you have to connect to the other phones WiFi. poor instructions there. spent an hour trying to do this until i realized Samsung just doesn't tell you what needs to be done. next, the mail, text messaging, and contacts is kinda confusing. i suppose if you use it long enough you'll get used to it but it really is a terrible system.........it seems each manufacture has a way of making life hard on you. just like us mail, there should be a common way to deliver don't you think? brand a is not better then brand b etc..... i also didnot like the fact that a lot of USB devices are not supported such as microphones and such. great, i can pair an x box controller to it, except i don't use x box or PlayStation. i use pc for gaming. i do use a lot of multi track recording apps though. so if tou like on site recording this aint for you. ok so great, it has a stylus. i can draw and paint which i do in real life. lets face it, this is for people who aspire and not anyone who would take it seriously. good idea though. thing is, now a days most phone manufactures are headed this direction which makes this kinda unnecessary.  i can speak in to most phone and it translates text better. i do like being able to write notes in hand writing and using a pencil, but for the future this just isn't logical or needed considering kids in school don't even need to learn to think anymore if you can grasp the future of education. this phone really doesn't have anything special to offer. its a 1000$ phone just like all the others and does all the same things all everything else on the market. big screen big deal, Cary your laptop if you need a big screen.  do your self a favor, a smaller phone will do everything this does and for less money. dont be a victim of marketing and get the latest greatest bs out ther. you can even get a used phone with a new battery for half the price of this garbage. lat, amazons return and refunds take for ever. once they have your money they send you through hoops and make you wait for any results. this is the second time i have had to deal with a refund like this and the last time i was repeatedly lied to just keep me in check while they took their time. terrible policies and wait times including the automated phone system. redundant questions in an attempt to route your call that just goes to a general customer service rep that asked all the same question all over gain and then goes through a scripted response that left me feeling more or less like a tool and number. nothing personal here, just makes you feel like a robot. thanks for another under par experience amazon. you've ruined my Seattle neighborhood and rent, parking, and food costs have gone through the roof while i struggle to pay for a phone that isn't even worth it.",32
5.0,"Android 10 update is out as of 12/31/2019 Happy New Year!
  
","October 15, 2019",Yes,"12/31/2019 - well the wait if finally over. the update to android 10 happened nearly a month sooner than scheduled. nice to see Samsung is rolling out OS and security updates sooner and more frequently than in the past! Android 10 brings some nice changes to the handset.12/21/2019 Update - i have only had this for three months now and feel i did make the right decision on getting this model. it enables me to do so much more than any phone i have had before. my hope that i would be able to use this phone in place of my pc for many tasks has worked out better than i'd hoped for. the time i spend working on the computer has easily dropped by half. this really is a great phone in so many respects.Before purchasing this phone the first thing I did was read through and watch a number of reviews for this phone from tech sources, zines, etc. Due to the cost of this item I did a lot more research going into it than I would for most other purchases. I wanted a phone that was well made, would last, could link up easily with my pc or even take its place for many functions especially camera and video. I got all this and more out of this phone! No wonder it is referred to as the 'swiss army knife' for smart phones. Should also note i wasn't surprised to see that every online review of the top android phones for the year had this phone rated #1.Design is fantastic! It looks even better in hand than in photos. Consequently there is no mistaking this phone for others. The screen has lightly slopped or curved edges which complete the near bezel-less design. It is as close to an all display screen phone as I could find. The structure is solid aluminum with no flex whatsoever. Gorilla glass all around and water resistant beyond what most phones are. This can supposedly be submerged in feet of water for many minutes without issue. Overall quality is as good as I expected. It is as close to a perfectly designed phone as I could find at this time.The screen is the largest you can get currently in the U.S. It is large enough for someone like myself with vision problems to see clearly, but not so big as to feel over-sized. See my attached photo of different phones side by side. The resolution and colors are jaw dropping good. I can see details in google earth on my phone zoomed in that I cannot see even when using my pc on a 65” 4K screen. That degree of improvement really surprised me. You can adjust the screen resolution from 1080P to 4K UHD+. When researching this phone I saw several ding the phone for having a 60Hz refresh rate and not higher? While higher refresh rates can be nice for gaming otherwise I am very happy with how snappy the screen is to respond as is. All in all I love every aspect of the display.The camera is arguable the best you can get when combined with the stock photo and video editing apps. Be it wide, telephoto, you name it this phone has it. The weakest area here is night photography. Currently there are a couple other flagship phones that do night shots better. That said when it comes to daytime shots those others don’t fare nearly so well. There is so much you can do, customize when it comes to taking photos and vids that words just fail. None of that matters if you don’t have enough space to store your media. With this I have no worries with the base 256GB of storage coupled with an SD card I have 758GB currently on my phone!They killed off the headphone jack! Yep it’s gone on the note10+ but not the note10? Lots of excuses as to why but real reason is they want you to buy their Samsung buds. I tried a generic brand dongle for my wired earbuds and it failed miserably. I then tried the Samsung version and got very good audio quality. IMHO that absolutely should’ve been included with the phone. Currently I’m using both my Bose QC20’s which are wired and a pair of wireless Amazon buds. They both sound excellent, no complaints whatsoever for audio quality. I still want the audio jack back though.Battery life and charging are the best I have ever had. Comes with a 28 watt charger that will take me from 80-100% in about 11 minutes. Even after a hard day’s use I have yet to dip below 50%. From my research it states and others have confirmed a 0-100% charge time of one hour. Unless you travel a lot, live in airports I don’t see the need for the $50 optional charger that won't do much more IMHO. The battery is the largest capacity I could get in a phone here and was also a factor in my purchase. It has never once gotten hot to the touch. Only a couple times has it gotten slightly warm and that was when I had it charging while using as a video monitor at the same time. It has the fastest wireless charging rate of any Samsung phone at 15W. The smaller note10 is 10W and the smaller of the Galaxy Note series is 5W for comparison. You can also do reverse charging, one of two currently made phones that can do that. Keep in mind doing so you get a slow charge but it works if ever needed.You get an 855 processor, vapor chamber cooling, base 256 GB of memory and 8 GB of ram. You also have expandable storage making it a true storage monster. As said great for anyone taking photos or vids. With all that underneath the hood you can truly multitask. Open as many apps as you want, I’ve never slowed it down one bit. It has enough horses to work easily with its system to connect to pc’s. There you can use your phone through your pc. You can grab and drag pics or files from one to another. All my office apps work on it. I should make some mention of the S Pen. It is great for doing any work on the phone. It enables precise work. Be it photo editing or just clicking on a box on a website, it absolutely improves the entire experience. You can do other things with but my take those are kind of gimmicky.The software, apps are very impressive. Coming off a near stock android experience it took me a bit to get comfortable with OneUI 1.0 meshed with android 9 but now I love it. I have already had several updates with OneUI 1.5 now on my phone. Android 10 has already gone out to some with the rest of us by years end. But back to the custom software, there are so many many things and ways to customize this phone to fit your specific wants and needs I cannot say enough good. Things like being able to set a safe location so your phone doesn’t lock at home. Similarly set it up so it’s safe when connected to a Bluetooth device, for me I set our vehicles as that so they don’t lock inside. My favorite of all is the Edge lighting. That takes the place of the old flashing LED notification light. Edge lighting is what you want from it. Set which apps you want to use with it besides calls. Get a text message the led show is on or not you customize it all. Colors, how it displays, where, how long, how wide. It not only looks amazing but it is much more visible than just one lonely LED light. You can even minimize it to just go around the camera punch hole. Security via pin, pic or sonar sensor. Samsung pay which unlike google pay will work on old stripe type machines. So you can use the Samsung pay feature in spots you’d never think you could. Seriously there are so many ways to customize the software I am still learning new things even now.Things I didn’t like, no 3.5mm audio jack made worse by no included dongle. The phone is beautiful to look at but the thing is slippery as all get out to hold onto thanks to being all glass. I put a case on the back immediately for just that reason. I don’t like having Samsung pay on the bottom to activate with a swipe up. Problem is if you have gestures enabled half the time instead of going to your home screen, especially if locked, you end up opening the pay app instead. S Pen gimmicks to me are a waste. My edge lighting didn’t work at first. I ended up having to get the edge lighting fix and edge lighting plus from the galaxy store (free). Point being it should have worked straight out of the box but minor gripe. They put a screensaver on at the factory, unlike any phone I’ve had before, and didn’t mention anywhere in the docs or packaging it was there. So I thought it was just another piece of the many protective clear plastic stickies you remove when unboxing, it wasn’t. They fixed that self-inflicted issue on the Samsung fold but not with the Note10+?Minor gripes aside this is the best, most capable phone I’ve ever owned. It is one of the rare phones out that truly allows you to supplement many things before you could only do on a PC. The extra screen size is not wasted. I don’t notice the camera cutout and that extra size makes it much easier to use with my poor vision. This phone is one I really can do work on without difficulty. I love the screen, the look, the hardware, the imaging setup.I would recommend this phone to anyone at this time based on my personal experience with it even at this price point. It does so much and is built so well. I fully expect it to stand up to the test of time.**FYI - The Note line is merging with the Galaxy S series to be formally announced 2/2020 along with a massive bump in the camera sensor size.",23
2.0,"More cons than Pros
  
","September 26, 2019",Yes,"I bet most people are buying this because of the camera and large ram and storage space. I’ve had this phone for a couple weeks... and although it looks sleek and awesome... I find that there are many flaws the more I use it. Here are a few good and bad things I find about the phone... more bad than good I suppose.Cons: the processing speed is not as good as my iPhone 7. There’s a little lag depending on what app you use or open up. One of the game I play on mobile ... mobile legend... I can not play using LTE... I have to connect to WiFi to play... where others games I didn’t have to. I find on the threads that many are having the same issue. I’ve tried everything to fix the problem but to no solution.Graphic and colors on this phone when I play Mobile Legends... is not vivid and crisp like my old iPhone 7. The colors are brighter but not clear and crisp.The s pen had an issue where it didn’t connect, I had to restart my phone for it to work again.Pictures taken looks great at first, but when upload to Instagram or FB, the quality is not there. The pictures look grainy and not crisp. Kind of blurry, but the original picture saved on phone is nice. Same as when I transfer or send them to another phone. What’s the point of taking great pictures of you can’t share the same quality to social media or other devices?Phone takes great picture of scenery but not good with people in the scenery. The colors pop out but it also makes our skin orange looking. I’d say they had a saturated tone. You will have to go back and edit it to look normal and not like a pumpkin.The screen can not display or scroll down to the full page length on some documents. On my google drive excel, I can not view the full page of my document. I can only scroll down. To like 3/5th a page and it doesn’t let me go all the way down to see the whole thing. Same as when I scroll right. Also, the edge curb is nice but sometime I have to try and look at a decimal number on the edge, which doesn’t display or can be seen fully because it won’t let me scroll right to see wholeDocument. This really got me frustrated, I had to use my old phone to look at the document.There is no USB cable. Both ends on the charging cable are same. I can’t even use an external battery to charge the phone.... probably have to buy an adapter to use external battery charger.Pros:There’s a lot more functions compared to iPhone. Though many are not practical and useful in everyday use.Nice sleek design and color.Large ram and storage space with option of added memory card for more storage space.Nice Dolby sound speakers.Lots of tweaks and twerks to make your phone more accessible to apps and widgets you often use. But also needs some time to set it up... if you know how...Over all I would give this phone a 6/10. Samsung got the right idea, but need improvements in picture vivid and crisp look not only color contrast. Also able to upload same quality to other devices and social media. For the hefty price tag, I would expect to have a better experience the more I use it and not just the first impression and then later discover problems after problems. That’s just frustrating. The large rams and storage space is great but processing speed is more important. The more storage you take up.. the more this phone will lag and glitch. All those space and not enough processing power to run it smoothly.",20

4.0,"Good Phone Coming from an S7... Note 10 Plus Charging Issues
  
","September 17, 2019",Yes,"Waited a long time for a Samsung phone with a Snapdragon 855 (Yes I know the S10, but coming from an S7 want something different). I don't just buy new phones when they come out, I wait until they are much faster and more efficient. Snapdragon 820 14nm chip, 845=10nm, 855=7nm.Pros: AMOLED, Snapdragon 855, 256-512GB Storage, 12GB Ram (Sorry Apple), Wireless AX (aka wifi6)Cons: Weak Charging Detected on Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 @ 80+ percent and will start to discharge your phone while using apps like Google Maps or YouTube. **I used a type A to C USB 3.0 with 56k resistor for charging. Used different QC 3.0 chargers and cables to make sure it was not the accessories. Your finger has to be exactly were the sensor is to unlock the phone. I would prefer it to unlock wherever I place my finger. No Aux (minor, but still useful in my opinion).FYIIf you want full charging capabilities of this phone you need a Power Delivery 3.0 with PPS and a USB type c to c ""e-marker"" cable. **Type c to c does not have a 56k resistors, make sure you get a e-marker cable for USB compliant and safety. To future proof get a USB 3.1 type C to C gen 2. This will support 100w charging and transfer speed of 10Gbps. Not any PD 3.0 Charger will do, you NEED a PD 3.0 with PPS that supports charging @ 10v/4.5a = 45 watts. No the Note 10 Plus will not charge @ 15v/3a standard as of 09/17/2019 (currently none on the market except official, waste of money unless you want to charge from 0-100 in ~30-40min). Once you go OLED screen it is difficult to go back to TN or IPS LCDs. Just make sure you don't set your phone to stay idle for a long time before it unlocks because OLEDs can ""burn in"" similar to plasma tvs. Wireless AX is the new wireless N, better speed and range. AC is speed only, no range.To SamsungI am not sure it is hardware, but if it is software. Please give us a firmware update that allows standard fast charging voltages.",16

3.0,"Before you SWITCH, read:
  
","October 22, 2019",Yes,"My review is aimed at those trying to switch from a more bare-bone android experience (or any other phone OS). If you you have  had a samsung phone for a few generation then this may not apply to you.-Samsung is trying to create its own environment, so depending on your situation,  switching may be difficult. I come a nexus 6p (google phone by Huawei, 2015*).  So my android experience was bare bones, and I liked the simplicity of it. Samsung on the other hand wants to trap you with all of own its applications, and while they are good, they are not the best. On top of that, it is not easy to uninstall or disable them (it is doable but you'd need time and above average technical skills to do it). An example of this is their own messaging,  keyboard, e-mail, browser, and assistant application (most essential applications). It'd be nice if they let you disable them, but you are stuck with them (unless you choose to use a PC software or other methods to disable them).-the specs of the phone are impressive, however, you do not get it all. in order to conserve battery the default of the phone is less than the top specs. for example the screen has 3 different setting for its resolution. So if you want the best resolution, you'd have to manually change it at the cost of more battery usage. Also, while using the phone with no apps in the background (aside from system apps and whatever runs behind the curtains), the phone was using an average of 6gb of ram. I am not an expert on this, but I think that that is too much ram being used for not doing anything. In my brain, the 12gb of ram being offered are not really 12gb of ram if the phone needs 6 of them to just run things in the background (again I am not an expert on this lol).-Camera si impressive, but it is definitely based on needs. the phone recommends using 4k 30 fps or video stabilizer wont work as well, I guess that is okay if the phone is placed on a tripod and not carried while videoing?  other than that, I was not all that impressed with the camera(s). My old phone took pictures that were good, this one took pictures were ""gooder*"" lol.-The pen. I come from a phone that did not have it, so idk, the pen is just there. I haven't really use it. I haven't had the chance to be like, ""hold on let me take my pen out so I can write down whatchu saying."" I haven't met anyone that does it either lol. Maybe if you are in school (but if you are in school and you can afford this phone, good for you!)?-depending on your carrier, you may or may not be able to use wifi to make/recieve calls or send/receive MMS, so you'd have to use your plan's services and data. This is big deal for me because there are places where I can only get wifi and not service. or there are times where I only want to use wifi.-In conclusion, switching to this phone is a big deal so be prepared for a lot of change if you choose to do it. The phone looks fancy, performs nicely, and is great. But at the end of the day, that is pretty much every phone out there now.",11

","September 12, 2019",No,"I bought this phone a week ago at Best Buy. After spending hours adding four fingerprints, installing apps, etc., it told me it had a firmware update, so I did that. After that, it wouldn't let me access the phone again. It forces you to use your password, and it told me mine was wrong. I knew it wasn't, I have a password system, plus I'd written it down. It doesn't give you the option of using a fingerprint or anything but your password.I then spent two hours on Chat with Samsung because I couldn't call them on the stupid phone. I gave them a detailed description of the problem, yet the doofus kept asking me to repeat information I had already provided. Finally he said he'd switch me to someone who would send me a new phone.After chatting with this person for a while, I discovered that he was in the Promotions Department. Are you kidding me? He then switched me to someone who SAID he was in Tech Support. I learned after a long discussion that he couldn't help me either. He had to gall to tell me that chat support had never heard of this problem.I Googled it and discovered that discussions about this problem that were at least two months old were in THE SAMSUNG COMMUNITY SECTION OF SAMSUNG'S WEBSITE. There it says that they have a ""special team"" set up for this problem. Someone needs to tell that to the chat support people.Pardon the yelling, but I've been using this phone for a week now, taking pictures, copying things from my old S6 Edge+, finding and installing apps, etc., set it so that it doesn't require authentication when it's at my home, and it has behaved perfectly. I've been on it all day at work, where it has accepted my fingerprint every time.I'm guessing it must have done a firmware update during the 12 minutes it took me to get home from work, because now it's locked again. This time it didn't ask if I wanted to update the firmware first; I would have said ""No!"" So again I had to switch the SIM card from my new phone to my old phone to call Samsung.Samsung Tech Support told me I could unlock it with findmymobile AGAIN (at least this time it found it; last time Google's Find My Device found it but Samsung's findmymobile did not). I unlocked it there, but it was still locked, both times I tried, and even though the icon on findmymobile went from locked to unlocked the first time and stayed that way.So, now I'm going to transfer everything from my Note 10+ to my computer through findmymobile (if possible), do a factory reset, wipe my data, return the Note 10+ to Best Buy and fight about the $35 restocking fee, and buy a Google Pixel 3XL. I'd just keep the S6 Edge+, but it's dying (hot when charging, losing charge at an excessive rate).",31
4.0,"Upgraded from S9+
  
","December 16, 2019",Yes,"Upgraded to this phone from Samsung Galaxy S9+. There are some stuff that i like and some other stuff i really hate.Okay here comes the cons; first, the on-screen fingerprint reader, compared to my S9+ fingerprint scanner, the on-screen is trash. Very hard to read and even if i get it to read, it takes more time to unlock than the S9+. Iris scanner is gone, which is quite unfortunate due to the trash on-screen scanner. The other part i dont like is the location of the power button, the power button is now combined with the useless Bixby and located on the left side, right under the volume button. I find it very hard to reach and sometimes get mixed up with the volume button. I'd rather have it on the right side. The aux is now gone too but not as much as a big deal for me, i just hate to see it gone. The battery doesn't last as long as i would like it to be, given i have to charge at least twice a day. Oh and one more thing, the notification light is now gone, there are apps to enable light notification on screen but I'd rather have the led than led rings on my screen cause it might cause burn-in in the long run.Okay now for the pros; the screen size and color is outstanding, bright and very pleasant to the eye. The S pen is great to have but not really a game changer for me. The screen is curved but not as curved as the S9+, which i highly prefer because it is so much easier to put on tempered glass. The sd card slot is still present on the Note 10+ but it was also on the S9+. Speakers are decent, nothing outstanding. Camera is okay-ish with additional wide angle camera. The cut out camera is great than having bezels on top and bottom. The Aura Glow color is Amazing.",7

The screen is bright, the camera is good, and One UI somehow hasn't made me vomit, Bixby is also something you can just completely avoid, there's built in Win10 integration, and the S Pen is just awesome.But the phone isn't perfect. Unfortunately the fingerprint reader isn't the best. It's slow, and often fails to recognize my fingerprint especially if my finger is dry. The lack of a 3.5mm jack hurts, and ruins the ""no compromise"" feel that the absolute top Samsung phone should have. And their attempt to force Samsung Calendar down my throat was annoying to say the least.All in all, I would recommend this phone if you're willing to sacrifice the 3.5mm jack for the S Pen, but at the same time I really expect a near perfect experience for $1099.99.",6

One, it came with great Memory right out of the box.  Two, no lag (very speedy between apps),  Three, the stylus is Great!!  I love to write notes and having extra features built into the stylus is just a bonus.  Finally the Screen itself is just stunning.  Pictures and movies are amazing on this display.  It's large... but not to large.  Even with the Phone protector (a Defender Otter Box)  on its really not that big and fits into my pockets easy.  I purchased additional memory for the already ample amount of memory that was on the phone already.  I just wanted to keep my books and movies separate.The primary reason why I got this phone is to replace my old LG Stylo 2.  This was a large phone as well with a stylus.  It had only 16GB of memory.  I had this phone for several years and it still works fairly well.  However, the battery was giving out on it and the memory was less than adequate.  These were the primary reasons to upgrade.  When I researched this phone I wanted one that would last several years again and have the memory and speed to keep up with future apps and software updates.  The Note 10 Plus just fit the bill.",3

Android 9 and Samsung UI 1.5 are fine but the new update (whenever it comes ) makes this phone probably the best android you can buy.The photo proximity feature is really cool and useful for doing projects,and the new update will finally get a worthy screen capture of recordings.Something needed on the Samsung line ,along with other improvements.I paired my phone with a Gear S3 watch and this is probably the first time Samsung has not abandoned an older product.I much prefer the Samsung in style looks and notifications along with exercise and paying are really my main watch things.The battery is excellent,the screen is amazing I don’t even notice the little hole.Both fingerprint and facial recognition have worked well with me.  Super happy with this phone and would recommend it as a work or personal phone to anyone in Android/Samsung universe.The smart switch from my S8+ worked very well.And it isn’t too big still fits in a pocket on a front shirt or in the pockets of my travel bags.",2

The Samsung cam over saturates and loses detail in photos where the google can will capture more realistic results with more details and less photoshopped results that make the photos look almost fake.- The default samsung messaging app is also really bad, it will compress any images and videos to such a degree that it will be totally blurry of you send things over SMS. It will also limit the size you can send beyond what other phones allow. Images you send will be subpar and pixelated. I had to switch to the google messenger downloaded from the play store; it is superior in every way and I can send things over like I was able to on my iPhone; the quality is much better than the compressed mess the Samsung default message app was doing- the navigation swipes are hard to do sometimes due to the size of the screen and the keyboard layouts are not well designed for one handed use even in one handed mode, I had a much better one handed experience on my note4.- this phone is near impossible to operate with just one hand most of the time- the placement of the camera in the top left corner means when you try to take photos in landscape mode your fingers can easily obstruct a portion of the camera and show up in your photos.  They should've kept it like the S10 where it's in the middle of the phone so your fingers would be a lot less likely to get in the way of the camera lense.I haven't owned a note since the note 4, so for me this was a huge improvement in most areas and I was waiting for a fullscreen bezeless phone with an onscreen fingerprint reader so that's why I chose the note 10+ over the pixel 4xl. I also wanted the flagship phone with all the bells and whistles so I chose it over the s10+. I switched from a note to iPhone and being pissed at iPhone's limitations after 5 years, mostly related to storage and random apps disappearing into icloud, I decided I needed to go back to android and was waiting for the right phone.I am overall very satisfied with the phone in the $600-700 price range, but wouldn't get it in the $1000 range due to some big flaws I mentioned above. I'd buy this phone again in this price range because i still it's great and in most ways its superior to the pixel and iPhone, but I think samsung could've done much better on this phone  especially since this is their flagship model. Oh also Bixby is annoying and I turned that off right away. If this was full retail of over $1000 I'd sadly go back to using an iphone or pay $600-700 for a pixel 4xl.",0

","January 6, 2020",Yes,"Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ (unlock-phone) is definitely a perfect smart phone, I purchased it; but I had to return it since US Product Phones - such as this Note 10+ - will not work in Indonesia due to IMEI restriction and registration to the Office of Ministry of Communication and Information Technology Indonesia.  So SAMSUNG, I am sorry for returning this US Product phone.If you guys try to purchase US product phones, please be aware that not every phone will work in every country, unless you keep SIM Card of your US provider with it and better to check it out with local provider prior to your International departure. Just an advise!",0
5.0,"If your looking for an upgrade, get this phone
  
","December 27, 2019",Yes,"There is really only one negative thing that I have to say about this phone.The finger print reader is good, but it isn't perfect,  sometimes it is slow. Use the face reader ifbit REALLY bothers, its MUCH FASTER!After this it is only positive!1. The phone never lags, ever! Even when under high stress (having dual split screen + app pop ups! Though some may never use this feature, it is highly practical!2. The display, oh my the display. Samsung usually has the biggest and brightest display of the entire phone industry and this device is King of 2019 displays. When watching videos to viewing photos, this phone's display is gorgeous!3. All of Android One UI secret features and customization - The Note 10+ is brilliant when it comes to Customization and building your phone to your preferences.  If you can imagine something,  you can probably customize it. Ive gone through customizing certain things about my phone several times throughout the past 4 months of having it, and IM STILL finding new things to change! For example, recently I wanted to change the shape of my apps on my homescreen and I found that I could by turning on the Devleoper Options. Its really spectacular what this phone can do.4. Battery life - what's to say that hasn't already been said? The battery, even under full blast ""high performance"" mode will last you all day.Pretty much it comes down to this:Have a phone thats 2+ generations older than the 10 series? Get this phone. Want to go from a Galaxy s9 to the note10+? Get this phone. Want to switch from iPhone to Android for more customization... GET... THIS... PHONE!I havent even discussed the s-pen yet which is the whole appeal of the note series, but it is fantastic!",0
3.0,"Box was open when it arrived, but great phone.
  
","January 2, 2020",Yes,"I took points off because the phone essentially arrived as an open box and everything had been knocked out of place inside. That is purely against Amazon for that, not Samsung. Despite this, the phone itself arrived in new condition.As for the Phone itself: Overall 4.5/5Pros-Screen is beautiful and vividPhone is large, but not uncomforable (this is case-by-case as I have large hands)Phone is extremely fast and responsiveBattery life is very good, I don't need to charge my phone before I leave work anymore.S-pen is a great addition and I love taking notes while the screen is off and lockedCons-In-screen fingerprint scanner is not nearly as fast or reliable as the one normally on the backNeither here nor there-Facial recognition can be duped, but I never use it as I prefer fingerprint readers, because I don't want to pick my phone up every time I use it.Overall, I am happy with the phone, but not with Amazon since somehow the sticker came off before or during shipping allowing everything in the box to move around.",0

It struggles to capture good detail. My S5 almost did better. Night mode isn't bad, panorama is cool, but I spent 1,300 on the 5G + version &amp; I am highly disappointed in the camera. Taking outdoor photos, it would blur, pixelate, and simply jumble detail throughout the photo...also had a major issue with depth of field in some shots. These I posted are a few of the best shots I got.On a side note, the Aurora color/silver phone is beautiful, ended up with a white because I orginally returned the first one that I thought had a camera defect. It's that bad.UPDATE: I have discovered it's some HEIC software/engineering in the phone ...apparently apple has done this bs for a while! It's supposed to reduce file size while retaining quality...well it doesn't work!! You can say save in RAW/JPEG format, but it still processes smaller than my S5 did (around 2-2.5MB) simply put: poor quality! However, the bones of the camera(s) itself are good...so I'm hoping a different camera app or even a software update is released later on where people can use the camera to it's full potential!!!",18

5.0,"Best Note to date
  
","August 26, 2019",No,"First off, let me say this is the 5th Note I have owned (2,4,8 and 9 previously).  I was horrified at the price ($1200), but the pre-order freebies took a little of the sting away.I can honestly say that besides the camera, there was little to no difference between the Note 8 and Note 9, and not REALLY worth the upgrade given the price.....The Note 10 on the other hand is a different story...it's worth upgrading from ANY previous note.I've had the phone 4 days so far, and amazed at how quickly it charges with the included 25W charger.  After setting it up, transferring files and playing with it for a few hours, I was able to go from 56% to 100% in 23 mins with the fast charger.  Battery life is better than my Note 9... I use my phone a lot, but am not on it all day, and haven't seen it dip below 70% so far (except for initial setup which is battery intensive).General speed of the phone is much snappier than my Note 9.  All I can say is that it feels more ""fluid"" than any other phone I've owned to date.  Gallery is lightning fast generating thumbnails and playing videos/viewing pictures....even from the SD card.  Sound seems to be louder than with the Note 9.Camera takes AWESOME video and stills.  Many new camera features I have not explored yet.Size of the Note 10+ is noticeably larger than the 9.  Which is great, for me at least.I have not tried out the fingerprint sensor yet, and when I do, will probably still stick with the facial recognition unlock...it's just so fast and effortless, I can't see adding the extra step of pressing a certain spot of the screen.S-Pen works great, and the ""air write"" mode is fantastic.  Again, many new features I have not explored yet.CONS:PRICE.  VERY expensive.  I'm not sure how long the promotion will last, but Samsung will give you $600 for a Note 9 trade in, which should be jumped on....getting THIS phone at $600 off with a trade in is a bargain.No old style headphone jack...which is not a con for me, as I have never used headphones with my phone, and if I ever did...I'm sure the included USB-C headphones would work just fine for me.  No replaceable battery...a feature not seen with Notes since the Note 4....I wish they would bring it back.  You have to pay extra for the even faster 45W charger.  Including a 25W charger vs the 45W charger is just a tease... but on the bright side, I read where charging your phone THAT fast greatly reduces the life of the battery.All in all, this phone feels like a major upgrade, where previous models felt like a minor upgrade.  This is a QUALITY phone top to bottom.  If you are looking to upgrade, all I can say is ""pull the trigger"".  DON'T get wrapped up in opinions on the net about how you should ""wait for this phone"" or ""wait for that one"".... I mean there will ALWAYS be newer, better features on EVERY newer model.... so if you are constantly waiting 6 months or a year for the newest ""better phone""....you're never gonna have a new phone.  LOL  As a loyal Note user, this has to be the happiest I've been with a new model in quite awhile.",11
5.0,"The Pros, Cons and Oks for Samsung Galaxy Note 10 (HR).
  
","September 10, 2019",No,"Pros:__________· Compact design, almost bezeless display, feels extremely solid, and the design is purely top notch. Nothing else out there as of 2019.· The AMOLED display looks fantastic. I found it a joy when watching or reading anything from this screen.· I found the fingerprint reader to be very sensitive and quick.· The Aura Glow is something I honestly thought I would hate. But this rainbow effect is a beautiful look because you don’t see a rainbow but, depending on the angle of the phone, you only see one color. Look from a different angle I get a different color. Very creative and something new in a world of black and white phones.· The video editor is super easy to trim and add music to your clips. I did see that it does work with Adobe Premiere Rush, so that’s a big smile for all your move makers on the go. I will also say, using the pen is a lifesaver when you’re trying to trim seconds of a clip on a smartphone.· For a phone like this, battery life is very good. From 0-100% it only took an hour, and as an average phone user, a full day charge, with the 25-watt charging they provided, will bring my phone around 20% battery life left. Samsung has a 45 W charger than can cut the time in half of the charging, but you need to pay extra for that one. Still impressive.· The S Pen is shorter and thinner than it looks in person.· The Pen does an excellent job of converting my weak handwriting into a text. All you have to do is write your note, tap the text area, and press an onscreen “Convert” button. For English grammar, it worked flawlessly for me. I see the use of this feature if you need to take a quick note asap.· You can sync the Note 10 to your windows desktop (Dex mode). I haven’t tested this feature out, as you’ll need a USB-C to USB-C, but I do love that you have a mini laptop hard drive in your pocket. Just connect it to a computer and the phone will mirror its screen on to your monitor. I can see this super useful if you need to do presentations at work. Just put the PowerPoint file in your phone and connect it to your computer at work.· Another cool feature in the video making world for this phone is the “zoom-in mic” feature. If you don’t have an extension microphone, the phone will use the mics that it has, but not at the same time. When recording, it will the mics on the front of the phone to record your voice, making it clearer. And if you zoom in the mic sensitivity will increase, like having a boom mic. I didn’t test this fully as you’ll need to spend some time comparing this feature, but from basic video playback, the mics are spot on. Samsung is putting up its gain for anyone who wants to film.· Taking photos or videos in very difficult places, the S pen will be your best friend. You can begin filming, or taking, shots, by just clicking on the S pen. It’s a small feature, but I believe is one of the most useful to have.· The stabilization is excellent. I was just walking while filming, and it looks like the phone was on a wire. This is the best stabilization I’ve seen on a phone so far. Well done Samsung.· You have revers charging with this phone, which will, of course, kill your battery. But still, cool to have.· The AR Doodle feature is really cute if your taking photos with friends. I took a picture of just random people and this feature allows me to draw anywhere on the pic without destroying it. Using the pen, making hats and mustaches can make even boring pictures funny.· The Live Focus mode main function is to let you blur out the background. I did like this a lot because you can just block anyone in the background that doesn’t fit your “perfect” picture. It does work well if your object is focused before taking your shot.· The cameras are…well…there just great. Sharp, colorful, ultra-wide provides the same color profile/quality as close up zoom. The details that these cameras can provide is beyond words. I have nothing to say on the overall outcome a smartphone camera like this. It’s the top of the class until Google’s Pixel comes into play.· The sound is also great. It doesn’t come to any specific location, but rather throughout the phone. Samsung built the volume deep in the phone so it can go everywhere, are you will never cover it with your hands. Loud and crisp (no base though).· Playing games like Alto’s Odyssey had no issues other than getting noticeably warm after 40 minutes, which makes sense for that power. Also thanks to the support of UFS 3.0 specification, you’re going to get faster loading times (This was hard to test how much of an impact it has on the phones day-to-day activities, but all I can say is that I had little to none loading time).Cons and Oks:__________· It’s the end. No more headphone jack. Bringing so much joy and now Samsung’s closest ally has let it go.· The night mode is good, but it’s still nowhere compared to phones like Google. Samsung has yet to master the night mode shots as their system is to up the ISO and slow the shutter speed. They did up there game, but it’s still not enough to get great night shots. I’m overall getting a busy shot and using the telephoto and ultra-wide lenses are both useless at night.· No microSD card slot on the Note 10.· The ultra-wide sometimes creates a fisheye effect. You will see this effect more if there are some bright/mixed colors at the end of your pictures (like a tree or a building with windows). I did notice that I got a slight bend at the way end of my pictures, which makes the image look weird. The solution I found was just to crop the image. I hope software updates will fix this.· With a group of people walking in the background, there were times that the phone had a hard time trying to get focused on the person I was taking. This happens when trying to use the regular and telephoto lenses.· The telephoto lenses tend to over sharpen my images. Taking a close pic of a rose I saw this issue come up. Now for a regular person, this is no issue at all, but for a photographers eye, you’ll see this.· Be warned, get a case. An all-glass design makes writing with the pen a slippery task. I felt more concern holding the phone than what I was writing, so I knew this a must-have case.· You can only write short notes with the pen. I notice that you can’t even write a full sentence on a single line if you wanted the phone to convert your writing into a text.· 45-watt charger cost extra.· The front-facing camera is…well, it’s a front-facing camera. Nowhere near as good as the back, but good enough for having meetings.· Samsung’s keyboard is horrible to use. If you get this download Gboard, it’s the best in smartphone keyboards.· The ultrasonic fingerprint sensor is fast, but even the tiniest dirt on your finger, it makes the process a little slower. Nothing really impressive on this if your hands are sweaty or dirty.· I hate the fact that you have to go to your notifications to shut down the phone. Holding the power button activated Bixby, you can change this if you want. To be honest, Bixby isn’t the best around, so I’ll always change it.· The S pen Air Actions are a neat little tool to use, but I saw more as an accessory than a tool. I didn’t feel the need to use this feature, but it does work. It also does take some practice to get the hang of it but it’s irrelevant for the day to day use.· The battery drains at a pretty consistent rate. The beauty of the device is the screen, but it’s the most that kills the battery.· Every single space on this phone is a fingerprint magnet.· This phone does have a little more weight than your average smartphone.Bottom Line:__________Samsung is putting the stops in making this a phone for filming. With an almost bezel-less display, an excellent video editing program, and a great battery life, the theory is supported. I admire the premium layout of this phone as the S-pen is very fun to use (but not yet a priority in daily use), the screen is just beautiful, and the system as a whole is excellent.There are some issues with the cameras on this phone, like the “night mode” inaccurate pictures, and I also wish they moved the front-facing camera to the side like before (even though the little black camera is small, it’s still noticeable.). But the honest truth is that I really have nothing super negative about it. Some small issues are there, but I know software updates will fix these problems, or at least I hope they can.Overall: A phone enjoyed for everyone, but built for those who want to film.Hope I was a help to you.Love,Honest Reviewer",11

I figured I'm just not used to it yet, but after multiple enrollments and trying to get it working well i HATE it. It makes phone much less convenient to use, at least it's a Note so screen off memo helps some.DeX @ 4k: Phone doesn't suppory this.  This was why i didn't go OnePlus 7 Pro, which i had tried.Battery drain seems significantly worse than my Note 9. Maybe its apps, I wont dismiss it could be testing phone more hours than I actually USED my 9.. but seems worse. Charging is fast enough it's a non issue.Roboform doesn't work and I've had done other app issues, I dismiss this mainly offer than roboform password manager. This makes inconvenient to use phone.If you have older phone, or NEED CPU I'd upgrade, otherwise I'd skip this phone.

","December 4, 2019",No,"Major issues with the audio, I had to purchase a 3rd party usb-c to 3.5mm adapter when I first got this because the official Samsung one was delayed at launch (serious???).If you want to do screen recordings and record your own voice at the same time, wait until they fix this issue. Basically, the mic gain is 2-3x more for the screen recorder than other apps (like Voice Recorder) for some reason, which will hit the noise ceiling easily causing distortion to your audio recording. But that's not the worse part, the big issue is there is a tick/pop sound that comes on intermittently as you start recording past 15 seconds rendering the audio recording unusable. This happens using the phone's internal mic or the included headset, or any other mic.I have contacted Samsung via email and the Members app way back when the phone launched in August but nothing, never even got one reply and the issue persists to this day.For those that aren't aware,  now instead of having a high quality DAC inside the phone, we have to rely on a cheap DAC inside a tiny dongle, so wired audio will NEVER be good as previous generations.In my attempt to get decent audio from this Note, I hooked up a Shure SHA900 DAC/Amp, and this introduces intermittent distortion (can hear the zing in the video)!  Ugg, can't win....USB C audio is just a big big mess, Samsung should avoid it and bring back the 3.5mm jack asap.PLEASE FIX THIS SAMSUNG.It's a real shame because the rest of the phone is great.",0

When purchasing unlocked, you have more control over the phone such as apps that are factory installed. The unlocked phone also gives you better advantage for no contracts with some carriers. Overall for price, Best Buy saves you $200 instantly when purchased in-store. Amazon is overpriced! With Amazon, to get the best deal, you would have to apply for their Amazon Prime credit card and get a $60-$100 when you open a credit card and then even after purchasing with the credit card, they give you a 20% off on top of that which still cost more. If you have an Amazon credit card already, the $60-$100 off does not apply as it is only for new card members.This is a awesome phone with great features! Definitely can't beat the camera and some upgrades.

","December 28, 2019",No,"First off, this thing is enormous. It has a massive 6.8"" 3040x1440 OLED display that is simply stunning. The clarity, color, contrast, everything is perfect and it actually reminds me of what the giant OLED tvs by LG and Samsung look like in terms of those things.I'm much of a tech collector and my phone before this one was the LG G8 ThinQ. It has the same chipset as this phone yet, this one is so much faster. I mean it literally scored almost 50,000 points higher on AnTuTu for me.The battery life is fantastic. The battery isn't massive and it's certainly not the biggest out there but with some background app restrictions in place it will easily go a whole day of medium use with battery to spare.The cameras are great, I think the main shooter on the G8 was slightly better but this phone has 3 of them. Main, wide, and telephoto. The telephoto lens is really fun to play with and can make some awesome shots.The build seems very solid. Even though LG's high end phones are often made using military grade durability tests, I feel safer with this in my hand than I did with the G8.As I said, the display is massive, color accurate, and sharp. Streaming media on it is a surreal experience. You're close to the screen size of a small tablet but can still hold it in one hand. I watch Netflix, YouTube, and stream my PC to it via nvidia gamestream. (Also, if you get at&amp;t's unlimited elite plan, you get HBO GO included 😉)The only gripe I have with this monstrosity is that it has no headphone jack. I suppose there is room for understanding with the regular note 10 but this thing is massive and on the bottom near the call microphone I'd say there is room for a jack. I use wired headphones because they simply sound better. You can't get better quality than a hard connection. If you also use wired headphones I suggest a HiFi Bluetooth headphone amp such as the FiiO BTR3, which is what I use.You know you want it. Buy it. I'm broke now but I'm not complaining. Bad financial decisions keep life alive :)",0

Universal Flash Storage 3 is not only over 2 times the old standard (2.1=1200 MB/s vs 3.0=2900 MB/s) but it also has lower power consumption.  So far app and game launches are blazing fast.Time will tell, but with these whopping storage options, 12GB of Ram and 4300mAh battery, this beast is going to keep going and going!And when you need to charge it, Fast Charge has you covered.  HOWEVER, for even faster charging, get a super amped USB-C charger (87w/90w).  I’ve got one for my laptop (ordered from Zon) and it feeds the Sammy 10+ faster than the included adapter.When my Note was at 75%, the Samsung stock adapter showed 41 minutes to full charge.When I hooked it up to my USB-C brick charger, it stated 36 minutes but was done in 33!  (I was not using the phone at the time).  So if you want faster you can get it.Wireless charging worked great, with and without a few cases I tested, along with my magnetic chip insert, it didn’t get in the way.In the box:-Phone-USB-C Charger with 3ft cable-USB-C AKG Headset (sounds fab, rubber like cords near ear and mic, soft braided cord going into the phone)-Extra Ear nubs (S/M/L)-Some documents which in the picture you will find a key one...The Note 10+ Unlocked comes with a screen protector!  What a great surprise.  It’s always a challenge getting good EDGE coverage on a 3rd party glass or skin.  This one is tight.  I wouldn’t have known right away had it not included the paper telling me so.  I’ve included some pics (with some dust to show contrast hah).  Over the top couldn’t be happier with the phone so far.You have camera and fingerprint sensor embedded in the screen as advertised, but also a hidden top speaker.  With the bottom and top speakers going the phone presents quite well.Be sure to turn on Dolby Atmos in the toggle section right away to get the hidden speaker to perform even better.I’ll post in comments if I have any more revelations (or insight to testing DEX software integration) or if you have questions, something you want me to check out, let me know!",19

(I bought a U.S. unlocked note 10+).2) Experience UI 1.5 is a serious downgrade from UI 1.0.3) I replaced a Note 8 with the Note 10+ while I am using 2 Note 9's. The pixel density and color reproduction going from 500+ pixels to 400+ is so obvious, the Note 8 was light years ahead in color. No comparison to the 9. It's night and day. Even my Note 4 of yesteryear had better colors. All in FHD+ BTW. For $1,100 I expected better Samsung. Sad to say, if I did not need the features such as Write On PDF and Hancom Office Editor, and hated the return process to boot, I would have returned the Note 10+ for another Note 9.4) And Samsung, why do you include a 15 watt charger, with extremely fast charging capabilities but you include a 2 feet long cable for $1,100?

1.0,"I bought the new note 10 plus as a gift for Samsung so they can keep it
  
","November 27, 2019",Yes,"I preordered the note10  plus so i could receive it soon as it was available for shipping. When i received the device it was new looked nice. As i was getting familiar with the device I kept seeing the commercials about the 30 min fast charging. I noticed mine would take over 4 hours to charge from maybe a 10%percent to get back to 100%. After messing with the settings, and knowing that 5G connectivity is around the corner if not already available in certain areas. My device said auto connect to 2g and 3g, with the majority being connected to 2g. (I did not purchase the 5g model) I called Samsung, they had me chat with a representative through text. This device is supposed to come with a 12 month warranty but they acted like I did something and am trying to get over on them. They asked if I'd dropped or exposed the device to water more than a few times during the chat session. Didn't offer any type of repair or exchange.  They walked me through numerous trouble shooting options. (Factory reset) That didn't work so they gave me information to one of their connected repair shops. I took the device in and immediately the gentleman said that sounds like a software issue and here we do the physical things like cracked screen etc. I call Samsung again get passed the chat process finally talk to a real person. This representative was nice, but the same questions about dropping and water exposure. Explained the process I've already been through, finally agrees to get me a shipping label since other options haven't worked. They required me to send charging cable and (my sim card) already explained that i tried numerous sim cards even a different carrier since it's unlocked, (a guy from work let me use his real quick)  same issues. I sent the item, received email updates about the status, like they received it, it's being worked on etc. It was returned with a note explaining what they did to it and that issue was corrected. Immediately I noticed they hadn't addressed the connectivity issue only charging problem. I had to wait for the battery to die down to see how long it took to charge. Remember the commercial said lightning fast 30 min? Well mine still took over 4 hours to fully charge. I received a survey by email asking how did we do. I was honest and was not the best review stated my unhappiness about all the hoops that I have to jump through and after paying over $1200 I still don't have the device with the capabilities I thought I purchased. Received an email with a small apology and said ship it to us once more and we'll replace the device to make it right. I did that and it's been around 3 weeks and iI have no confirmation emails with status updates. I tracked my package through UPS and it was delivered and received.  I finally called and they told me they had received it (two days later than UPS records) No further information since they barely received it. I called again and asked they informed me they have to take it apart to find the problem. I said I was told to send it back to get a replacement. They said no they are going to inspect it for water damage or evidence of dropping, and they are going to repair it if they deem it can not be repaired they will send a replacement. Also they said the connectivity issue was not addressed because I refused to send in my personal sim card. I still have no status updates of any kind no emails nothing. So my advice is not to deal with Samsung directly and to go to your carrier where they exchange them easier and let them deal work Samsung. Im extremely disappointed with Samsung over this ordeal I started with the S5 and have bought galaxy exclusively for my family over the years including tvs and a refrigerator. Now that it was time to upgrade the kids s7 edge and s8 active I let them both go to the dark side and get Iphones. Didn't want to Jane to deal with this issue 2 more times.

","December 2, 2019",Yes,"Let me say that basically, I liked this phone.  I have an older Samsung Note 3, and I had no problems transferring all my data to the Note 10, which was contacts, phone numbers, pictures, etc.  However, I did have issues with getting this phone on the Straight Talk network.  I have a Note 3, and simply wanted to transfer my number &amp; all info to the new phone.  Easier said than done.  After many hours on the phone, and a visit to Walmart, still no resolution.  I went online to order a new sim card &amp; contract (that I didn't need), and their website would not complete the purchase.  So I have returned the Note 10.  Let me add, this phone does not have a headphone jack, so you can't use an aux cable to stream music to your radio.",0
5.0,"Great phone for professionals!
  
","December 23, 2019",Yes,"I got the phone around Thanksgiving . I switched from a Google pixel 2 and I love the new 10+. It has a great battery life of around 24-30 hours with my usual usage of emails, music steaming, browsing etc. The fingerprint reader is slower than the pixel's but works well none the less. I love the high storage capacity on the phone which allows me to work on the go while editing word docs as well as PowerPoints. The screen is huge and has a very good resolution that really pops when you watch HD videos. I am ambivalent about the camera given that I was using the Pixel series. Don't get me wrong, the camera is good, but probably could be better. My photos are not professional (just random shots -family, pets, etc.) And it works well for them. I do like the love focus mode and the night mode (night-light from pixel) is also pretty decent.From a professional standpoint, I think this phone blows most of the other phones away with it's specs and capabilities. I forgot my laptop at home one day and I used Dex to get all my work done (used my Mac's USB C to HDMI+USB C+USB adapter to connect to keyboard, mouse, charger, and monitor). Worked like a breeze. I have the Samsung S3 tab so I was familiar with the S pen. Although I do not use it as much as I thought I would but it still is a nice piece to have when I am taking notes or want to draw over a photo or diagram.Honestly, I would recommend this phone to professionals. Admittedly this is an expensive phone but it is well worth the dollar amount if you are looking for a professional device that can take on not just the normal work load but go above and beyond what other phones do.",0

1.0,"Horrible Fingerprint Reader, and bad bad bad audio through USBC
  
","December 8, 2019",No,"I got the Note10+ at [boxstore] last week for a really cheap price out the door with a case. Super deal and I was extremely excited to get it. I used to have a note 4. Really missed the s-pen and when I was due to upgrade was the year the of the Note battery issue.Anyway, I really wanted to like the Note 10+. It is blazing fast. Fast doesn't mean usable. The phone had two major flaws for me so it's out. I think I actually could have lived with it if there were only one out of two of the below flaws, but in the end, I've returned it. These flaws may not be present for you, but they are being talked about and I didn't realize it when I purchased.Flaw 1: But that fingerprint reader on the note 10+ is just abysmal. I tried all the ""hacks""... multiple finger prints, multiple fingers, etc. Nope. It was 40% reliable or worse. You have to position the finger, looking at the big phone... no real muscle memory to hit it... slide on the glass, and the stupid ""press harder"", ""unrecognized"", etc. And when it does finally recognize, it's slooooow compared to my s8+ which is like lightning, 100% reliable every time. I thought maybe I'd wait for a firmware upgrade, but the device has had several, and it's still awful, so IMO it's not getting better. Also Samsung is likely moving away from this technology because it's slow and unreliable, which means they won't invest in optimizing, or they can't. Why did they go to this bad tech? Why didn't they stick with what works?Flaw 2: The use of the USBC for headphones is a terrible experience on the Note 10+. Audio on included ear-buds keeps cutting off after 10 minutes when touching the connection. Which means if it's in your pocket, all the time. If you're working out and it's on a machine that is vibrating, it cuts off, etc. You can read more about my experience I've posted about this issue here. When others chimed in with similar problems I decided OK, this isn't so isolated and likely people just use bluetooth but I'm not going there yet and expect to use what they provided.Other cons I would have been willing to live with:Too big for hands with case: For me, the larger phone and typing, I found was more problematic. My thumbs have to move significantly more distance. Like I said, I would have gotten over this, but just sharing this is pretty huge and I have pretty decently large hands.Voice to text... I don't know if it was a bad mic or what, but my speech to text was much less accurate.No LED status light. i missed it. Samsung should do this in software in the always-on-display. They should code a LED notification. Yes, there is an app in the Google play store. But the way it is implemented it uses more battery (10% a day?) than if Samsung coded into the OS directly.My s8+ just feels ""good"". The Note felt bad. It might have been the case. It might have been the sharp square corners. It might have been the total width. It might be the smooth curved screen of the s8 that I used to wish were flat. I don't know.Screen shots are hard on the Note 10. The power button moved. It's just not as easy.There is no ""discrete checking my phone"" with the note 10 +. Everyone will know you're checking your phone.There are some positives which I mentioned above. I really wanted to get back to using the s-pen. Someone told me to get the Note 9. Maybe I will, but I don't know if it is really faster than the s8+. The ""other cons"" above I would have lived with and eventually gotten used to.Sharing this experience to help others, and I'm sure there are many note 10+ users who are extremely happy. I was not one of them.",2
2.0,"Bloatware, Spyware &amp; Shovelware Galore. No 3.mm Jack. FM Radio chip disabled.
  
","December 4, 2019",No,"My employer gave me this phone.  The amount of RAM and available disk space is nice, but I would not recommend the phone for the price.FIrst, it is loaded with bloat and spyware. I used adb shell uninstall to remove close to 100 pieces of bloatware and spyware the phone came with that could not be uninstalled/disabled by default-- including back door software (so they can help you... yeah no thanks) and the ever annoying Bixby. The Samsung app store has a difficult to find auto update feature that you have to turn off to get the phone to stop reinstalling bloatware that you just removed via google play. It also won't stop messing with your permission settings. (BTW, the EULA on the Verizon locked phone states it will cram updates down your throat regardless of if you want them. Might one to check that on the unlocked version). The Package Info app from the playstore is a must to see all the hidden bloat on this phone. Unfortunately, that app also wants intrusive info.Second, the phone doesn't have a standard 3.5mm headphone jack. The 3.5mm jack was not just used for headphones, but also for card readers like Stripe/PayPal Here and as an FM radio antenna.  I use that adapter all the time. Now I have to buy an adapter. Failure to include at least an adapter with a very expensive flagship phone is not really acceptable. So far using an adapter has been more miss than hit and a source of frustration. Even if the adapters available worked on all headunits (they don't), you can't charge the phone and play music at the same time like you could before, so no good on road trips.Third, the phone has a FM receiver chip and some reviews and sites incorrectly report that it supports FM broadcast radio. Well, nope. The chip is disabled-- despite Samsung saying it was no longer going to shut these chips down. Even if they issue a firmware update to enable it-- the 3.5mm headphone wiring doubles as an antenna for these-- and it is missing-- so no radio reception anyway.Really a disappointment and not an update from previous generation phones that had these features. Buy an older gen of this phone to get these missing features back, or buy something else entirely and save some money. My personal phone is a flipphone-- as I got tired of spyphones (probably because as an ex silly-con valley mobile phone dev I got sick of the unethical practices of the entire spyphone industry).",2
5.0,"Insanely great
  
","October 30, 2019",No,"First I didn’t get the phone through Amazon, I upgraded on my carrier plan, which is Sprint. First impressions, it is just a great looking phone and while it is a large phone, smaller than expected. There’s very little to complain about other than of course the cost but it is what it is and depends on how you view it.COST- It isn’t cheap in any sense but is coming down after being out a bit. However if you take into account the the base 256gb memory and 12gb RAM, it’s not that bad. This is one of if not the highest base memory phones you can get. Then you can still add more with a micro-sd card, getting it to about 1TB (accounting for phone’s needs). The other flagship offerings start at lower memory and most don’t offer additional memory in the way of cards. 12gb of RAM is huge, got look at any laptop and see the amount. I think my laptop only has 8b, which is a couple years old but does begin to struggle. Now this isn’t exactly the same thing but when you account for the pen and office programs it gets pretty close.SIZE- It’s big but is it really? Compared to an older Nexus 6, not really. In my opinion it’s just long, the width really isn’t that bad. Then add in how slim it is and the overall package feels and looks smaller than the largest iPhone. I don’t have large hands but can still easily navigate the screen one handed. This could be that I’m used to larger phones, so if you’re coming from a smaller one, it may be a learning experience. A good example is my friend has an iPhone 7+ with an OtterBox, we both thought the Note felt smaller and easier to navigate, which has the slim OtterBox case on it. It again boils down to how thin the phone is.BATTERY- Crazy good, is the best description. I can charge it and play games do whatever and it lasts pretty much all day. Then when it gets to 20%, slap it on the supplied charger and in about 30 mins. it’s full. Wireless charging is pretty fast as well and I honestly have just a cheap wireless car charger. The main thing to note is to use medium power settings, night mode all the time, and pay attention to screen brightness. I found this keeps the phone fast but doesn’t drain it. It has several options for power control to use.Then pen works great, the cameras are really nice, it will save as RAW if wanted. Now it does lack a few things such as headphone jack, the newer 90hz screen and could have gone to the newer chip 855+. The jack I don’t miss as I have been using iPhones and easily felt the trade off for a micro-sd is worth it, plus they do provide a set of headphones. I haven’t used them as I use Shure’s Bluetooth ones.The 90hz screen is kind of a nag but battery life is going to be better with the 60hz. I don’t think you’ll notice unless you have been using a 90hz screen. The same can be said on the newer chip, battery life may be better with what it has, and it is super speedy.In the end though, if you have a note 9, you really don’t need to swap yet. I actually was going to go 9 until my carrier offered a deal. The 9 would have actually cost more, so I went 10+ after trying the note 10.",1

","September 25, 2019",No,"Random note: not sure if it's a different model or international one or what, but my Note 10 + box also came with a provided clear case as well in the box with the SIM ejection tool. Maybe double check that to see if you get one as well bc I have not seen anyone else posting this!User interface: I'm currently still testing it out, but I previously had the Pixel 2xl which is still great in all aspects for today's phone tech environment. I loved the simple ui and design of the Pixel and the bare Android experience as well as the icons, so I was hesitant to get this phone bc I did not like the Samsung ui, bixby, or the bloat. However, after getting the phone using it about two weeks now, I can say it's not too bad. They provide a lot of customization with the Samsung themes so I was able to change up the icons and a lot of pre-downloaded apps can be uninstalled if you don't need or want it.Battery life: 5 stars. Great battery life and the extra fast charging is really quick with the in box cable and adapter. Wireless charging is also pretty good, though I haven't used it too much, only to test it with my 24000mah battery pack that had wireless capabilities. Note that I am not using the maximum display resolution. I'm using the default FHD as I feel I need the battery life more than the full display resolution capability this phone can handle.Screen: 4.5 stars. Vibrant. I docked it a half just because it's almost too vibrant and saturated, even when put on normal or natural settings. Example, was playing some games to test it out and the reds were just way too saturated and bright. It actually hurt my eyes a bit bc it made everything else so washed out and it was just bright glaring red. I had to double check to make sure I wasn't in the saturated display mode and it wasn't. This might not be a problem with others but for me it was something highly noticeable and wished there was a way to tone it down a bit. However, I do know Samsung has always had more saturated displays. Otherwise than this minor thing however, everything else is quite beautiful and good.Processing: 5 stars. Videos, gaming and just all around application use and processing is fantastic so far. The ram is huge and it handles many things very well. I can have about 10 apps open and not worry about it refreshing in the back ground. My pixel 2xl was starting to get old and dated and would begin to constantly refresh and restart everything even if I just left it in the background for a small bit and returned to it. This may be subject to change as I get more use, data and applications on the phone but so far it's very good and everything is super smooth.Camera: 4 stars. Haven't tested it thoroughly, but so far the pictures are nice. The default camera app has a lot of different modes and features that make full use of the camera. The Pixel line of Google in my opinion has had some of the most amazing camera quality so this phone has a lot to live up to in that aspect for me. I will continue testing this as I go.",1

The Best Buy version of the same phone (Model #SM-N975UZKEXAA) did NOT work on Xfinity Mobile's network.**I'm a fan of the Note series. My last phone was the Note 5 and it did it's job for 4yrs. Sadly, the battery dies fairly quickly now. Upgrade time: staying with the best Android hardware, Samsung. Best Note is the 10+/512GB. That's what I bought and went with Xfinity Mobile (using their version of the 10+, SM-N975UZKEC). It's fast as heck and with the 12GB RAM, it has no issues or slow downs. My old Note 5 had 64GB storage, which I banged up against a couple of times. This monster has 512GB of storage. The stylus is a bit smaller than the Note 5, but it has better functionality.My service is Xfinity Mobile which is basically a reseller of Verizon with the added benefit of hitting all the xfinity hotspots if cellular is an issue. It is not 5G, but it's not available to me anyway (or for awhile). The GREAT thing about using Xfinity's Note? The did not install a bunch of Candy-Crushed-Bird-Verizon-Crap apps that you can't get rid of. Seriously, 2 apps ""My Account"" and ""Stream"" were installed.Overall, I'd recommend this to adults - not to your kids. Get them a name branded cheap phone and you keep this flagship monster.",1

All frustraiting.Google Pay - I go t use google pay and 9 out of 10 times, I put my phone on the NFC tag and have to then unlcock it. I tried everything. Apparently if I'm connected to a blue tooth device , like my headset or smart watch....that's why. So I have to turn off blue tooth. All these issues are deal breakers.Hopefully samsung listens and fixes....",1

","November 7, 2019",No,"This is my 4th Samsung.All the replacement are not counted. My original reason was for the largest screen size. The Galaxy 3, Note 4, and Note 8 lacked quality.I was told Apple and Samsung are equally bad in defective phones. With this phone I was told the quality was far superior and instead of two years it might still be good for 5+ years. I have put Ghost Armor screen protectors on a lot of phones and Tablets.Incredible quality 100 %.The 10+ screen protector is garbage and  will be replaced. The bloatware is hideous.For a person who has never played a single video game and no use for Bixby it would seem that I should be allowed to remove anything I desire.The face recognition after all these years should be much better. Attempting to use the phone is hampered with interfering advertising. I was misled and wasted a lot of money on the latest Tablet. You would think it would be mostly comparable with the 10+. There is no point in also bashing the Tablet.Are they worth $2,000 for a year?",1

","September 12, 2019",No,"Love the phone as a whole.  I tuned off animations and it made a huge difference, mostly with certain apps like outlook and youtube. The fingerprint reader works ok but not great. It's the slowest thing on the phone imo coming from the note 9 with the reader on the back which was way faster.The power/lock button being on the left side took me awhile to get use to but I'm glad the buttons are all on one side now. You have a flat surface if you want to use the level feature. The bezels are almost completely gone which makes movie experience much more immersive and the speakers are some.of the loudest on any smartphone I've had. So loud in fact the vibration form the speakers slightly make the phone rumble. Some people don't like that but I love it.Camera is amazing. Night mode is slow somewhat annoying having to hold steady for such a long time allowing the shutter to let light in.Overall it feels good in the hands, note taking is on point (pun intended) and the battery lasts all day. I would highly recommend this phone to anyone.",1

","December 20, 2019",No,"Do not buy this phone there is issues with their WiFi card. It will randomly kick you off your WiFi and it will say ""connection blocked"". It happens on all networks doesn't matter if it is linksys/netgear to ubiquiti to Cisco to Ruckus happens on every network. I ask my friends who have the same phone and they have same issue. There may be a day it doesn't happen then it will happen 20 times a day. There are forums all over the web complaining about the same thing. If you ask Samsung they deny it and are zero help in resolving it. Besides that it is truly and awesome phone.",1

","December 20, 2019",No,"Great phone, but in its case (from Samsung) dropped 3 feet onto carpet. It hit the back corner adn shattered the corner and sent cracks across the back glass.The Note 10+ is NOT as sturdy as the Note 8, Defunct Note 7 or Note 3.The Samsung case is worthless for protection. Other cases have corner gaps inside the case so the phone doesn't get all the energy transferred to the corner if it falls. Not so for the Samsung case.If you buy the phone, get a better case than what Samsung sells, and keep in mind you might want an Otterbox case, which is big. And this is a big phone.They smartened up by shipping the phones with a protective film on the front. No bubbles!! But, the film is terrible. It scratched right away. So I need to replace with a nice screen protector from Amazon, and deal with the bubbles.I love the phone otherwise.",0

","January 6, 2020",No,"The phone is decent, *IF* it would function properly. And as far as Samsung's Tech Support- yep, they're equally as disappoint. A $1000 wasted, as I'm a few weeks in, and AT&amp;T blames Samsung- and of course, Samsung says ""We're aware of these issues, but there's nothing we can do until a software update comes out."" Awesome! So, here's what my $1000 phone gets me: 1. No top speaker. So, if I get an incoming call, I can only answer it on speakerphone. And to make calls, I can only use speakerphone. Bluetooth. Nope, keeps crashing. Certain apps, and websites. Yep, they crash too. A $1000 piece of garbage. Good riddance, Samsung.",1

","December 21, 2019",No,"Coming from a old LG G6 after owning the Note10 for a month I am really disappointed. Battery life is a joke,(mt Lg battery would take me to the night, but on Note the battery is gone at none with same apps and brightness so low I am ashamed to show it to somebody) fingerprint recognition a joke(takes multiple try and a few seconds), face recognition a joke(only in bright light and takes a second or two). Besides it barely gave me anything more than the G6 but costs 10 times more. Samsung is a scam. I am so sorry I bought this phone.",0
