5.0,"CAN'T BEAT THIS T.V. FOR THE PRICE!!
  
","February 1, 2019",Yes,"Received this product today.  It was in EXCELLENT QUALITY when I received it.  Easily un-boxed and able to set-up.  All items were present. I have to say this was the quickest set-up I've ever had for any type of device (T.V, PC, Laptop, Phone, etc.).  Although I did a bit of research before I purchased this device through Amazon.  Then after I ordered it and while I was waiting for delivery I did a bit of reading on this site (reviews &amp; Q&amp;A's) just to have an ""edge"" when it came time to set it up.  When all was said &amp; done it probably was an hour to hour and a half from opening the box to setting back down on the couch after all was done.Once you read through all the Q&amp;A's, and about 75% of them are questions that have been asked two to three times, you'll have ALL of your questions answered so once your t.v. is delivered you have a plan of action and push right through that set-up.Here are the biggest ""complaints"" that are non-sense when dealing with a ROKU t.v.:A. It doesn't COST A PENNY TO SET UP A ROKU ACCOUNT and activate your T.V...if for some reason you come across a site or a phone call demanding payment in order to activate your t.v...hang up or whatnot, and reevaluate (i.e. make sure you have the correct website typed in or the correct phone number dialed in).  You can activate your roku t.v. with a ""free"" roku account.  You don't even have to put in a credit card.B.  You get what you pay for...Yes, while that is true in every aspect of life you can get a good deal without having to pay out the butt.  I believe this is one of those times!!C.  This item DOES NOT COME WITH A WALL MOUNT.  If you want to wall mount it you buy the mount yourself.  If you want to specifications of what size wall-mount to buy they are all in the directions that come with the t.v.  While I didn't wall mount it (I just used the stands that come with the set) If I wanted to all I had to do was either read through the Q&amp;A's (as that question has been asked over 20 times) or just read through the ""directions"" booklet provided with the T.V.D.  If you want to use your phone as your ""roku remote"" all you have to do is d/l the app from your store (G-Play or apple) and you're good to go.  No, the roku remote doesn't have numbers on it and yes it does have volume control on the side of it. Just remember, both your phone and your T.V. have to both be on the same wi-fi connection in order for your phone to work as the remote, if not, then it's a NO-GO!!E.  If you have satellite, cable, etc...YES, it works with this T.V., along with Wi-fi.  The model I have doesn't work with Ethernet or bluetooth, but TCL does have models that do work with Bluetooth &amp; ethernet.Be a bit proactive, it'll save you a bunch of time in the end!As I stated earlier, it didn't take any time at all for me to set this up from beginning to end. Take a bit of time and do some research!!This set is great quality and you are easily able to adjust it to your liking in the settings menu.  Every aspect of this set is adjustable.  I couldn't be happier with the amount I paid for it!!!Try it, YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!!!In the pictures below, one of the pics is the front of the set and the other is a side shot showing the thickness of the set along with the fact that there aren't a million plugs coming from the back area.","1,659"
5.0,"Very happy
  
","February 13, 2019",Yes,"I first want to say that I read through about an hour of reviews before deciding to purchase this TV. Fully understanding that sometimes you get what you pay for. I've waited almost a week to write this review because I wanted to give myself time to fully evaluate this TV. I give it 5 stars for price and quality. I'm very happy I took a chance to try a lesser known brand over the bigger names. The things that stand out the most that other people complained about are 1) no volume buttons on the remote. Not true. They are on the side of the remote. 2) having to enter your credit card for the Roku account. Also not true. At the bottom there is an option ""skip this step"" so you do not have to enter any payment information. 3) some people complained about the sound and picture quality. If you go into the settings, you can change all of those things to your liking. There's even a ""game mode"". So overall, I'm extremely happy and I would reccomend this TV to anyone who is looking for a great TV at an even better price.","1,191"

","December 15, 2018",Yes,The TV is excellent and weighs about 10 lbs.  You have to register it using a code.  I tried doing so with my phone but it didn't work.  So I called a number on the registering app -  Turns out I must have entered the website wrong and then dialed a scam number.  This guy told me I needed to pay $99 to register the TV.  I said not a chance bozo I'll read the manual and send it back If I have to pay anything else with the TV.  I called the number in the manual and the woman said there is no cost to register the TV and that the first number must have been a scam.,"1,148"
5.0,"Great as a computer monitor
  
","November 2, 2018",Yes,"I purchased a TCL 32s301 ROKU tv to use as a multi computer monitor in my office. It was only 720P but I was impressed by the quality of the picture. I do not do much gaming just an occasional flight sim. So when I saw this TCL 32s327 was 1080P I thought to purchase it for my wife who plays lots of games on her computer.  The good points about this TV: excellent picture quality, ROKU, WIFI, great customer support from TCL (contacted for general questions and received answers within a couple of hours), thin bezel, 3 HDMI ports, USB port and excellent price for quality and features.The bad: It was not free but compared to what I have paid for dedicated 1080P monitors of less size and quality in the past it was almost free.The bottom line: this is a reasonably priced Tv with great features, great picture and overall good quality.  It is a really good computer monitor.  I highly recommend.",671
4.0,"""Great"" TV
  
","December 1, 2018",Yes,"Having read reviews that mentioned issues with shipping damage, l was hesitant to order online.  However, the tv arrived in perfect condition.  At first l couldn't insert the HDMI and did not want to force  it.  Thinking the HDMI cable was out of date, l initially hooked up using the coaxial cable.  As coaxial, l found out, cannot pipe HD, the picture quality wasn't great.  I went back to the HDMI and pushing harder was able to insert it.  Once l did, the picture quality improved quite a bit, yet the input info still said only 720p.  Researching further l learned that my cable box has a hidden menu to enable setting the output to 1080i or native.  I set it to 1080i and picture improved further.  The picture quality is stunning when looking fairly directly, but loses quality quickly as you move to the side.  Typical of LED TVs.  How livable to you depends on how much you want to pay.  For specs that say the speakers are only 8-10w, the sound quality is great!  My preference is the theatre setting.  It's getting hard to find anything but a 4k TV, which most people will be watching in 1080 anyway.  I have gone to my local big box store and see no difference in the 4k picture quality at 1080 or this TV at 1080.  49"" is big enough.  The distance between the leg stands is 37""  It is costly to purchase a TV stand for a larger TV.  Some as much as the TV.  The Roku and other free offerings are many.  There are commercials when watching free content, but that's to be expected.  For the price, size and quality, this TV is a homerun!After owning for almost 6 months, l downgraded my review to 3 stars because the TCL tv has started making a rumbling and crackling noise when l stop, start or ff a recorded program watched from my DVR.  It also occasionally makes the same sound when scene changes while watching regular tv.  Instead of a digital tv it sounds as if l have a mechanical tv with an electric motor.  I called TCL.  They had me boot up a couple of steaming channels that do not make that noise.  Therefore they said, it is my cable provider.  Only l have other brand TV's that do not make this noise.  Because of that, my cable service says its the TCL tv.  As TCL blames my cable service, l am stuck with this annoying noise.  The picture is great and tv is great otherwise, but this remains unresolved.  Update: I determined the problem was that I changed the volume setting to ""level""  With that off, the tv no longer makes tha noise.  I haven't contacted TLC about yet.  Other than the noise, with or without volume leveling, I notice little difference.  Otherwise it's still a great tv and value.",520

","November 28, 2018",Yes,DO NOT BUY THIS TV ITS NOT WORTH IT.  It doesn't connect to WiFi and if it does Everytime it is turned on you'll have to re connect it yourself or wait an hour for it to auto connect. Now remember this is if you can get it to connect at all. When you call the makers of the TV on their support line their 1 and only solution was to unplug the TV and plug it back in. Awful customer service. Awful product. Awful everything. Don't waste your money buy from a better brand. Even at 200$ it's not worth it because for them to call it a smart TV is false.  I'm sending it back in getting my money back.,294
1.0,"TCL Roku TVs are great! But...
  
","November 29, 2018",Yes,"This TV had no picture. I think it was from the screen having a huge crack in it. Yes, I am sure that's it. I think one feature that it lacks is some sort of protection before I opened it, but I can't talk about that, per Amazon's rules. Yet, having an adequate cushion is very important. Very disappointed. I love my other Roku TVs from TCL but this one was doomed. TCL should rework this feature.",292
4.0,"Light, Bright, Quality for the Price.
  
","November 20, 2018",Yes,"I love this TV. I bought it to replace an old Insignia that burned out. My first surprise was how little the set weighed. Assembly was as simple as four Philips head screws for the stand feet below the set, plugging in, and completing the Roku onscreen setup.On to the details - The Picture quality is crisp and vibrant. Playing video games is incredibly easy, and the display connected to my PC without any hiccups. I blew the first three hours just watching BSG clips in glorious HD. You do have to download the free youtube app, as the preloaded youtube app is for the pay TV service. The build quality feels solid, but I have a minor defect inside the LCD panel that I've decided to look past like a flaw in a Persian rug. Sound quality isn't the best, you get two speakers mounted below the display panel, and they're not the most powerful. However, plugging in external speakers is extremely easy.As this is a smart TV, Wifi is of course, built in, and performs well.I'd never heard of TCL before deciding to purchase a new TV, but a guide website recommended it as a best value at price point. A minor negative review for amazon here, I had a heck of a time limiting buying options through search. Thankfully, I had the TCL name to guide my purchase.If not for the minor screen defect, I'd probably have ignored the sound quality and rated this full stars across the board.",153

","November 29, 2018",Yes,"I have purchased two of these 32"" Roku TVs. I originally bought on for my guest room and I like it enough to give one as a gift to some friends. This small TV weighs very little and the feet are not all that stable so I used some U-hoo tac putty under the feet in case the cabinet (which has wheels) gets moved.  To set it up all you need is a Phillips head screw driver and the CORRECT password for your wi-fi. It does not have an Ethernet plug, it only connects with wifi. You will need access to the internet (computer, tablet or phone) to set up your account (free) and type in the activation code on line. That's it. Once activated you have lots and lots of things to watch and lots are free. Apparently you can add an external antenna for off the air shows and even use it as a computer monitor. I have not tried those features.When you start up the TV it will search for your Wi-fi. Identify the correct wi-fi and make sure you type in the correct password. There is a set up video on their website if you need help. If you get two green check marks it will do any updating  that is needed and when done, you are ready to explore new video choices.  If you don't get two green check marks your password is not correct. Either you got the upper or lower case wrong, typed it wrong or it was changed by ""someone"" in your household. My friend was trying to set up his TV and was not getting the green check marks. His wife came home and gave him the current password to the wi-fi and it then connected just fine.",106

","February 25, 2019",Yes,I’m a 63 year old lady who is 100% oxygen dependent. I had this 49 inch smart TV up and running on my mantle within 25 minutes. It’s a little heavy for me since I am short and I weigh 136 pounds. Honestly I was worried at first.  Anyway I put the feet on lifted it into my mantle plugged in the HDMI and power cords. Followed the directions with my iPhone and it works beautifully!!!!  The price was reasonable and the Roku remote is easy. I downloaded the remote onto my iPhone so if my cousin looses it I will still be able to use the remote by using my phone.  The picture quality so far is awesome. Sounds great.

","January 15, 2019",Yes,"Over the years, I've had many LED TV's of all different brands. I was a brand snob a few years back and always got Samsung but with time and age, I realized the quality difference isn't that substantial. I opted for the TCL 49 inch 1080p Smart Roku LED TV because it was 280 dollars. For the price, you couldn't beat the competition.After having this TV for about a month, I can safely say it works perfectly. The image quality is wonderful, the native Roku app built in comes with all the apps I could ever want and need + the size and weight of the TV is amazing for moving it.Never again will I buy a tv priced more than what I “need” and I can’t see myself jumping to a more expensive brand for the same results.

","February 20, 2019",Yes,"If I could give less than 1 star I would. Not for the television itself in particular but it keeps adding channels I didn't order not want. Its a royal paints keep deleting them. The television itself works. When you activate it SUCKS! After you turn on the tv it gives you an activation code. A little while later you get a call that asks for that code then the tirade of pressure selling of special activation orders  even though it says on the activation screen says that ROKU does not charge for activation. Then you are transferred to tech support where they give you the options and it is very confusing and the call has so much background noise coupled with the accents make half of what was said unintelligible.

5.0,"I'm Impressed
  
","February 2, 2019",Yes,"I think for the price, TCL cut reasonable corners. Somehow, 32-inch TVs now are ""small TVs"" and as such, are more appropriate for bedrooms. This is where I set up my TCL smart TV, and it goes perfectly. I have no complaints about the image quality. Sound quality from the built-in speakers won't blow you away, but it is perfectly fine for a bedroom. The sensitivity of the built-in TV tuner isn't anything to write home about, but it is far from the worst I've seen. There is no wired networking, but 1080p video streams over Wi-Fi just fine; you only really need wired networking to stream 4K, which this particular TV model doesn't support. I appreciate that TCL went with Roku for their Smart TV platform rather than trying to reinvent the wheel with their own thing. And other than a red TCL theme, the Roku experience is pretty stock too.PROS* Good picture and sound quality for its size and price.* Near stock Roku software experience.* Bloatware is removable. Or in many cases, you can even prevent installation of unneeded software in the first place.* Easy to find and easy to understand signal meter when watching antenna TV.CONS* Wobbly legs even when fully screwed in.* Roku remote is pretty limiting for watching antenna TV. There is no way to direct dial a channel number. You also can't dial RF numbers to manually pick up channels not picked up during the channel scan, so your only option is to run a rescan and hope none of the previously found channels is taken away.* Roku remote has four shortcuts that can't be reassigned to apps you actually use, and you can't even disable these shortcuts. If you are watching live TV and you press one of those four shortcut buttons by accident, you'll be taken away from the channel you are watching without any confirmation.I don't know how this TV will stand in the test of time, but so far I am impressed and would not hesitate to recommend the 32-inch 1080p TCL smart TV.",61

","December 21, 2018",Yes,"Amazing tv for the price. It reads hard drives and thumb drives from the USB port(the harddrives have to be the proper format first). It plays most formats of pictures, music, &amp; video.The smart tv channels have a lot of media to choose from if you have wifi. There are lots of cable channel apps like HGTV, TBS, etc. that offer both paid media and free media. It looks like the first season of a lot of the shows are available free, then you need a subscription to the channel to see current media. My wifi is limited, so I won't be watching much of these channels for a while.The app for the tv is great. It doubles as a remote, but also can play media straight from your device wireless. I only tried the android app. I was able to write a program for my tablet that turns on the tv and plays music videos from the hhd as an alarm. Now I get to wake up to Taylor Swift singing me awake.The only bad thing I have found is that the tv doesn't have Bluetooth, which is very disappointing.

4.0,"Updated Review after further testing, Exeptional buy for the money.
  
","February 18, 2019",Yes,"I previously left a very negative review for this product.  First I do stand by my statement about the panel.  It is cheap and can be damaged with very little effort.  TCL needs to stop using tape with what amounts to super glue to secure the panel.I resolved networking issues by performing multiple updates. Packet captures indicate loss and drop of less then 15% so not too bad on WIFI.  I was able to find advanced settings, navigation is confusing in that video and audio settings have to be done in a channel?  Not logical to the consumer but if you think about it you want to set your picture settings when your looking at something besides a grey screen.The supplied media player ONLY SUPPORTS H.264 and MKV files for video.  If your media is AVI or MPEG your not going to be able to use that using the media player.  You can however use PLEX as long as you set up a PC or something else as a Plex server.  Most will prefer that anyway. I complained about brightness.  By default the system comes on low  power settings.  The Panel is a bright LED, but it will use more power.  It has multiple options for picture quality and sound.  The Roku App is outstanding, not issues there.  The software is actually very good , the hardware is a little lax but good for the price.  Again the panel will break with almost no effort.  USB port is a little hard to get to TCL should reconsider the width of the port access panel. The remote is simple and easy to use.  Navigation is fast.  Sound quality is actually better than my Samsung 60 inch that I paid over a grand for.  I have yet to test antenna quality video.Last, the TV does have bluetooth however do not expect to use it without paying Roku $200 for a set of speakers.  Roku decided to block any bluetooth use unless you connect their speakers.  Once you connect the speakers you can connect bluetooth devices. The speakers have mixed reviews and I do not agree with this type of ""product functionality ransom"" that so may companies are moving towards.While you could actually hack this by setting up a device with the MAC address of the speakers there is a simple way to work around it.  There are many cheap bluetooth transmitters here on Amazon you can purchase that plug into the audio out.  This will get you around the issue for about $30.  Just be sure to get one that is not just battery powered but can be plugged in.Overall the functionally of the menu, the apps and the stability of the software is outstanding.  Given the price, this is an exceptional buy.  Just be warned it comes with some caveats.I will update my review if I find any new exceptions.  I stand by my rating.",41

","February 10, 2019",Yes,I needed a second monitor for my work laptop and saw that for a 32in it was cheaper to get a TV then an actual monitor. The tv looks and works great. I love the extra roku features that come with the smart tv and the easy-to-use interface. Since its 1080p I can clearly see text on my screen. The thin bezel takes up very little space and set up was just screwing in the legs. For graphics it might not be the best but for regular computing it's a great deal to use as a monitor. I like that I can always switch on roku and watch TV shows if I want to at anytime. It also shows me a thumbnail of what will be displayed depending on what input I select. It's getting rare to find 32in TVs that are 1080p. Most are now 720p. At this price point it's the best deal for a 32in with all the features that I was able to find anywhere.I also bought the 4k 49in TCL tv for my office and love that too. I'm really surprised about the quality of the product for such a cheap price. As soon as you turn it on it goes right into setup mode.

The number of ports it has is outstanding even though I will at most only use 2 HDMI.  I was even surprised by the packaging.  I noticed there were a couple 2"" long holes in the front of the box so I was nervous of damage.  It was fortunately packaged with a foam cover, not very thick though, but sufficient that there wasn't a single scratch much less a break.Lastly, I want to comment on the weight.  This is the lightest TV I've ever picked up.  I live in a 3rd floor apartment and have lugged both a foam mattress (90 lbs) and an oversized bean bag lounger up those stairs.  I was dreading bring up the TV.  I'm not exaggerating in the least when I say that I could carry it with one had.  The box has 2 handles and I only used one taking it from my vehicle to the stairs.  Obviously I was more careful on the way up, but in my apartment, I literally picked up the tv with one hand to put it on it's low stand.  It was a strange feeling.TL;DR: Great TV, more than I expected, super light and I would recommend it to anyone and probably will.",25
3.0,"Issues
  
","March 6, 2019",Yes,"This could be a 5 star TV but the design/function of the remote system fails. First, having the volume buttons on the side is really awkward to use. Second, the remote (or sensor) seems to go to sleep after a very short time requiring that I often have to push a button twice to send a command. Having the LED located on the bottom/back also causes ""misfires"" unless the remote is pointed at the top of the TV. It also appears that the remote sensor is located on the bottom edge of the unit and uses a piece of plastic to pickup and channel the beam.  The wi-fi connection seems to be weaker than what I have on a simple Roku stick located further from my router. (The TV is about six feet away in the same room). The included legs are rather flimsy and cause the unit to sit about 1 1/2 inches lower than an older TCL TV with a pedestal type base.. Trying to use a soundbar would block the IR sensor. Could be a decent TV but for these sloppy designs.UPDATE: Called TCL support and after numerous troubleshooting steps, the rep said they would send a replacement remote. The replacement arrived within two days but was actually worse than the original! Did some testing and found that either remote works perfectly when ALL of the following are met:  the remote is less than five (5) feet from the TV, the remote is held at the same level as the bottom edge of the TV, the remote pointed exactly at the center of the bottom edge of the TV. I started shopping for a universal or learning remote and settled on the RCA Platinum Pro 3 device remote. Neither the listed TCL or Roku remote codes worked but using the Auto Code Search on the TV device bottonI located a code that worked all functions. Using the code retrieval function I found the code number which turned out to be codes associated with Tatung and Vizio brands.When I tested the remote, it worked from across the room (about 25 feet) and controlled all function instantly with only one click. Hopefully someone from TCL will read this and redesign and improve their remote!",24
5.0,"Love it! Should have bought before now!
  
","January 8, 2019",Yes,"I held off a year buying this to replace my older 40"" commercial monitor because I wasn't sure I'd like the computer monitor functionality. I also purchased it because I'm looking for a digital signage solution for my wife's business.So, if you're on the fence, here are a few things you might want to know that aren't well advertised.Auto-Channel Select: In my case I want it as a monitor, so I didn't want the screen to turn on, go to the Roku home screen, and me have to select the computer every time I turned it on. The default settings are just that - which makes sense for a home. But it has a nice selection of settings to change that. I can select the default input to go to when it powers on (so for digital signage I can auto-power on to the QuickESign digital signage app if I want to). But for my home-office purposes (shown in the picture) I can have it auto-tune to the computer's HDMI input and it will become a screen automatically.Sleep Settings: Of course when the computer goes to sleep, the monitor will do so by default as well (which is fine for me) but you CAN change it if you want it always-on.Computer Resolution: The resolution as a computer screen will default to 1920x1080 wide screen - in case you're curious what the maximum resolution is. That's it.The Remote: It's easy to use, but I DO wish you could reprogram some of the buttons. I'm never going to use the ""hulu"" button my remote, so it would be nice to reprogram it to COMPUTER input instead. But that's really my only complaint and it's not like they advertised that you could change it. It would just be a nice feature.Weight: It's incredibly light weight. I don't actually know the weight, but I replaced a 40"" commercial monitor that weighed almost 80 pounds with this thing and my old monitor arm is just overkill at this point. You could mount this with any TV mount capable of holding 20 pounds with room to spare. (though I wouldn't do that if you were going to be extending the arm out on an articulating mount... because... physics.)I love it and will be ordering another for the XBOX upstairs in the guest bedroom and another for a customer's digital signage solution.",24
1.0,"Decent tv, could have probably splurged for a better one
  
","April 9, 2019",Yes,"Set up was incredibly easy. Not sure why so many reviews below had so many issues with scammers? I set up a roku account online and easily hooked up my account to the tv in less than 5 minutes. The best part about the tv was definitely the price and how easy it is to set up. The image quality is good and the tv has all the apps you would ever need. If you’re like me and don’t pay for cable but have a number of streaming services, then this tv is foryou. The only issue I really have is how slow the apps work. Sometimes it takes Plex or Hulu a while to load and kicks me off sometime for poor internet connection. I have the fastest google fiber you can get and shouldn’t have any streaming issues. Whenever I check the network connect on the tv it always says there were no issues detected so not sure why it tells me my conection is bad when I’m the only person on the network? Anyways, if you just want a cheap, decent TV, I would recommend this but don’t expect “Samsung” (my other tv brand) quality is terms of speed and picture. But again, it’s less than $200So it was worth it to me.Updating my review to a one star just because after having the TV for two months it is always freezing and laggy and slow and can beever catch up with the remote.

","March 15, 2019",Yes,"I rarely write reviews and benefit regularly from them: THANK YOU to all of you who take the time to let us know how you rate your purchase.  Amazon is awesome.  I bought TCL 32S327 32-Inch 1080p to put in front of my treadmill in the basement: tired of using my tablet.  I mounted it on my wall with Mounting Dream TV Wall MD2380 and I couldn't be more pleased.  The WiFi signal (from about 50 feet away, upstairs) reaches great (as it did for my tablet: which I worried about).  The set up was a breeze.  Note: at first I couldn't find the volume control on the remote.  It drove me nuts until I realized the volume up down buttons are on the SIDE of the remote (phones do that, not remotes: at least, so I thought).Also good to note, I did have to create a Roku account, but it didn't cost anything.  They use the account to keep track of which apps you want on the device.  I only have Netflix and Amazon Prime videos, and so far they are both working great.  I highly recommend this TV.  Oh, an added bonus is that Roku has an app that allows remote control from your smart phone.  If I want to listen via headphones (if I don't want to wake anyone up) I can plug the headphones into my smartphone and listen from there.  This prevents me from having to get to the back of the TV to plug in the headphones there (which is what I was originally planning on doing).I literally just installed this TV last night and haven't had a chance to see it in action.  But all my testing has been very pleasing.  I will update this review later if my experience is any different.",15

I have had the new, 2018, model for about a month and sure enough, the same problem appears - sounds cuts out and I have to unplug it and plug it back in to fix the problem.

The glow is not noticeable in the day or if there is any light in the room. But, if you wake up in the middle of the night, you will see the entire screen of the TV with a glow.The issue here is that I worked with TCL support to absolute zero resolution. They continued to ask for a photo of the glowing screen. The glow WOULD NOT show up in a photo because it was too dark. It was only noticeable to the human eye in the pitch black room - a camera could not capture it. Rather than offering to replace the TV or try to replicate it in their lab, they continued to ask for a picture.I finally sent them a picture of the TV in the dark (the photo looked completely black, but they asked for it?). I also sent them a photo of the TV in the day (they asked for a photo of the TV). After I sent these pictures and reiterated, once again, that the glow could not be captured on camera, they asked for a photo again.TCL said they could not replicate the issue in their lab (I doubt they tried).

5.0,"See pictures: Perfect TV for a non-theater type home setup. Simple and intuitive with a nice picture
  
","April 7, 2019",Yes,"This TCL 40-inch TV offers a great solution for most casual home setups.  We have put it in our closet like armoire that had been previously accommodating a fifteen year old standard definition 42"" plasma TV. That old plasma had been handed down from our family room a few years ago when we upgraded.  The problem was, it required we keep an extra cable box setup in our bedroom at a cost of $11/month.  Since we infrequently use the bedroom TV it did not make financial sense to keep the cable setup and as a result we sacrificed a usable TV.  This TV was a reasonable investment whose upfront cost would offset the cable box setup in a little over a year.  We also now have Netflix, Youtube, Amazon Music and many broadcast channels from the internal antenna jack and all the app channels we care to add on (ESPN, News, etc).The installation was simple and required nothing but another device with an internet connection to verify connections/logins (I used my iPhone).  The remote control is simple to use and the TV's interface is simple to navigate.  For a simple home setup, this TV is perfect; with its nice HD picture, simple interface, reasonable price and internal speakers.  This was well worth the purchase for our needs and I would recommend this TV for all but those looking to use it as part of some glorious theater setup.  Should any issues develop as time goes on I will update.  A picture is attached for reference.",13

","August 25, 2019",Yes,"Two very bad things about this TV. First, I already had an Amazon Fire TV device on my existing TVs, and the reviews on this TV said you can use a Fire TV Stick with this. Let me assure you that it is a nightmare to set up, and then barely functions with the Firestick. Secondly, the original code that TCL sends to set up my TV did not work, and I was given a number to call and a web site to visit to get a new number. Well, the web site I visited and subsequent phone number was a scam designed to mirror the official TCL site. I had read the directions specifying that there would be no extra fee charged to register the TV with ROKU, so when the representative said there would be a fee, I challenged her and asked to speak to a supervisor. She said she would ask someone to call. While waiting, I checked the paper copy of the instruction manual, and noticed the phone number in the manual for TCL Product Support did not match the number on the web site I had visited. I finally did get the official TCL representative, and she confirmed there was a problem with a scam web site. The TV seems to work fine now, but the risk of falling victim to a scam is very high.

We were intending to use this as a monitor for a BluRay player and video camps at a camp without internet.  I had to drive it to a nearby town to get it activated.  I am not sure it will remain useful without a constant connection.  This is a truly terrible concept; the TV is not yours. It's Roku's, and without your birthdate and credit card they won't let you use it at all.Also, the Roku website requires THREE different Captcha tests, which do not work (or even appear) on an iPhone, so you need either a larger tablet or a real computer to activate the account.Stay away from this ""television"" at all costs.",10

Because of that I had to return and get new ones. And my wall studs are not lined up so I can't use the one they recommend since it's a single point mounting.

Pressing one of these buttons takes you directly to that channel.  Great works well. The problem is that the user can't re-program these buttons to the channels of their choice. For example, one of the buttons is pre-programmed for ""Sling"" which would be great if I subscribed to Sling, but I don't. I would like to have the ability to re-program that button for PBS.

I researched this problem on the web and discovered that many others have experienced the very slow response time when viewing Netflix. This is unfortunate, because we otherwise liked the TV and the price.",10
4.0,"Excellent performance, poor remote
  
","March 23, 2019",Yes,"I chose this model because it appeared to be the only 32” TV (or one of the very few) to satisfy my main requirements: full HD, three HDMI inputs (cable, DVD, and computer), good reviews, and low price. On performance alone I would give it five starts: the picture is excellent, the sound is good for a TV of its size (much better than my two previous ones), and it has a full range of adjustments in its settings and options menus.  Still, nothing is perfect, and I have a series of complaints that force me to give it at most four stars.Only one complaint relates to the actual performance: in spite of the TV’s relatively good sound, I still prefer to play anything musical through my external amplifier and speakers.  That worked perfectly with my previous TVs which had analog audio outputs.  With this one I have to use a digital to analog converter, and the sound level I get is rather low, so I often have to use the built-in speakers to boost the sound to a satisfactory level (admittedly, I don’t know whether that is the fault of the TV or of the converter).The most serious shortcomings of this TV are in the remote control.  It is tiny and implements only a few functions; for others one has to go through the on-screen menus.  In addition, the on-button doesn’t work some of the time, do I must use the physical on/off button located on the bottom of the TV.  One of the worst features of the remote are the sound volume controls: they are narrow switches on the edge of the remote, like those on telephones. These switches are hard to find and one often presses the wrong one.  Furthermore, the volume scale is very finely gradated, which means that one has to press the switch for a long time to get any noticeable change in volume.The shortcomings of the remote can be somewhat alleviated by downloading the ROKU app to a mobile device, such as an IPhone, which can then be used as a remote.  This gives a much more visible display, and the usual iPhone keyboard can be used in searches – much more convenient than dragging a cursor around the on-screen virtual keyboard.  A great advantage of the app vs the remote is that the app provides virtual volume controls on the I phone's screen.  However.It would have been nice if several additional functions had been implemented as virtual buttons instead of menu options, specifically functions that one wants to apply while the TV is playing, such as aspect ratio changes and captions on/off.The app also suffers from being unable to turn the TV on if it has been off for more than 12 minutes, because the WIFI connection is then severed automatically.The following comments about the video streaming experience do not, strictly speaking, apply to the TV’s performance, but they are relevant since ROKU puts its label on the product.  I think this experience isn’t all it could be.  For example, the forward, backward, and pause buttons don’t work on many streaming programs. In some cases, they work on the program, but not on the ads.  Even when the buttons work they give very little control – there is no fast forward and back, only jump to the next or previous segment.  One has much better control when watching a program on YouTube through the computer.Finding material to stream is easy when one knows what movie or performers one wants, since one can search for them.  On the other hand, browsing through available material is frustrating, since one has to go through an enormous amount of material from many different sources, and because one is presented with a large icon for each item, the lists require scrolling through many screens.  I wish one could get simple alphabetic lists, as one does in most VOD implementations.In summary, this is an excellent TV for the price, but it could be significantly improved by perfecting the user interface.  I would have gladly payed a few more dollars for better user controls with a better remote.",8

","August 31, 2019",Yes,"These TCL TV have processor issues.  In setup mode or any mode where wifi is not active, the tv operates properly by instruction from the remote.  As soon as you use any feature that requires wifi, say Roku, the remote stops working.  I have spent several days troubleshooting this myself because TCL customer service is useless and dismissive.  The problem is that the tv depends on the Roku interface to control basic tv functions which depends on input from the remote.  So, since the tv won't process the wifi signal and the remote signal at the same time, nothing works.  It's that simple.  If you buy one and you think your remote is bad don't waste time being sent a replacement remote.  It's not the remote, it's the processor.  This is why some people say their phone works better than the remote, because the phone is controlling the interface thru wifi.  Now, that isn't necessarily a fix, because the tv has horrible wifi performance.  Our old Wii has better performance.  While I wanted to like this tv because it has a decent picture, the faults strongly outweigh the positives.  It's cheaper for a reason and it's not worth the trouble.",5

It asks you to select what device is connected via the HDMI cables and then that’s it! You’re ready to go!Netflix, HULU, ROKU, and Amazon are all pre-loaded apps.

The remote has to be aimed just right at the sensor, meaning most of the time I have to press buttons more than once to get them to work, and it doesn't work from the other side of my living room which is apparently too far away. That's really annoying. It also doesn't ""remember"" the last device it was on--for example, if I'm using the Xbox, turn off the TV and then come back to it later, it has returned to the home screen instead of remembering the Xbox input. Finally, the Roku is slow and has a slight yet irritating lag. Makes it pretty hard to accurately use the remote to click through Netflix options or input letters on the keyboard, etc.",6

I use the TV mainly for my children to learn Spanish and Mandarin from Netflix with different languages audio feature.The TV box came in a perfect condition. However, I had a problem on the first day with it when connecting the TV with my Wifi Internet.It took several try to get the Internet connected to the new TV. If I got it successfully connected, it then the line often dropped.To test it,  I put my old TV attaching the chromecast in front of it, then using my either Acer laptop or Ipad to cast the Nextflix movie/cartoons like I did it for the last 3-4 years. I had no problem in casting it. The distance of the new Roku Smart TV to the router/modem is the same distance as of the old TV with Chromecast and Acer lapton/Ipad.This means that the Roku Smart TV has a weaker receptor to receive WIFI's frequency wave from router/modem, whereas the chromecast/router/modem all have no problem in doing so.I have no choice that I must return it and I am thinking of buying different brand name, because definitely it is time to buy a smart TV. the regular TV with the casting devices attached to it is becoming obsolete.",6
4.0,"Light, VESA 100 mounted TV is seamlessly integrated with ROKU functions.
  
","June 26, 2019",Yes,"The TV arrived today, so this is a first look.  I believe it uses VESA 100x100 mounting, that is, it replaced a TV that was on a mount that used VESA 100, with the standard 4mm screws, and everything just moved over.  So if you are buying a mount for this TV, you need VESA 100.  It is physically very light.  The box is labeled ""team lift"" but that is silly. I was able to carry it with 3 fingers very comfortably.I bought this because it supports ROKU natively. I had just set up a ROKU ultra and the setup experience was exactly the same, plug in, connect to WIFI, tell it language and where I was, and then I hooked it to my ROKU account.  It took about 15 minutes to download and install all updates.I am still in the cutting the cord transition.  Right now I am testing PlayStation Vue but it does not work well for me.  But it does have local channels (no antenna possible where I live, and wired internet is limited to 10 megabits) and some DVR so it works.  Sorta.But the ROKU TV gives me options. It seems to support almost everything and does it smoothly.I downgraded the remote because it does not allow the service buttons to be reprogrammed.  There are dedicated buttons for Netflix, Hulu, Prime, and Sling. These buttons are convenient if you use the service and a pain if you don't.  Whether or not you have the channel, if you accidentally push the button you are suddenly not watching what you were. I don't use Sling (for example), wish I could repurpose the button.  Well, anything is easy to access from the home screen.Once the Roku part of the TV updated, I had to access each service I use and authorize the TV.  This took about 5 minutes per service to type passwords and codes.Finally I used the ROKU Android app to check that the app worked as a remote control.Since I would probably have bought a Roku box for my TV anyway, this just saves time and a connection.Internally the HDMI connections and tuner are treated as channels.  If you never use them they can be moved to the end of your channel list.My smaller BenQ monitor has a noticably better picture.",4

These seem like the most popular ones.  I'd be nice if you could customize these somehow, but since we can't i'm glad they picked good ones.

","May 11, 2019",Yes,"I'll start out by by saying this is my fault for not looking close enough to the pictures (bunch of models and not all of them have easy to read specs).  I've been looking at 43"" TCL televisions for the last couple of years and finally got fed up with poor wireless performance on my 32"" TCL (I love my 32"" TCL except for the wireless part).  I don't believe it was my TVs fault...I just have wireless users/clients at my house that jump on and pull a lot of bandwidth streaming other things.  I finally saw a good deal on the 43"" TCL and bought it.  Went to set it up...no ethernet?  This is a shame because I love TCL products and I love the integrated Roku.  It's really mindblowing such an inexpensive feature isn't on all smart TVs.I wouldn't have bought this model if I had known there wasn't a wired ethernet port.  My choices now are to return the TV or live with the caveats.  I'm grudgingly keeping the TV after my update below because I don't need a 4K TV and don't feel like paying an extra $50-100 for a Series 4/5 version with an ethernet port.Update: After doing more research, only the 4k 43"" versions Series 4/Series 5 versions have an ethernet port.  I don't need or want a 4k TV for a bedroom, but TCL forces you into this decision if you want an ethernet port.I did find a USB to ethernet adapter that can be used on this TV.  I don't like how hot it gets, but so far it seems ok.  Also, when you turn off the television...it doesn't really turn off.  It's in suspend mode and puts the USB in sleep mode.  When it wakes back up, the adapter won't work until you restart through the menu.  Apparently using a powered USB hub is the fix for this.  All this hassle and mess does nothing but take away from the end user experience.I bumped the review from 3 to 4 star, but I still feel like this is all so unnecessary for the ~50 cents it costs TCL to add a built in ethernet port.Update: Bumping it back down to 3 stars.  The ethernet adapter performance was actually worse than the wireless.  When the TV goes in to sleep mode, the adapter doesn't wake up without a full system restart.  Tried installing a powered USB hub, but that doesn't stop the adapter from going to sleep.  Worst case scenario...buying a Roku for my Roku TV that has an ethernet port...It would be nice if one of the search criteria on Amazon for TVs was whether it has an ethernet port...it's too easy to lose track of what you're looking for when comparing features for multiple TVs.",4

So I call the number and Jerry takes all our information and wants $99 to activate the TV and hook it to our existing system.  I tell him that it says right on the TV screen there is no charge to activate the TV.  And he tells me that it is not to activate the TV, but to hook it with our system.  So we start dancing back and forth about this charge.  If it was up to me, I would send the TV back to Amazon at this point, but my wife says lets just do it and get it over with.  Jerry says it's a one time / life time charge for adding another TV to our RUKO system.  My wife thought she was getting a good deal buying the TV for $149, but now we are up to $248.  Then as I write this review, I'm reading the other reviews and wishing she would of bought a better TV and just put a RUKO stick in it.

At first I thought is was odd but I figured they (TCL) knew what they were doing. I figured wrong.  When I used my TCL in the bedroom and used the Xfinity App it became a real issue.  I go to the guide and it starts on channel one.  The channels I like are from 301 to 498.  The only way to get there is hit the up button one at a time.  It would take me 10 minutes to get there. Plus I would have to do that each time I go to the app.If I wanted to go to channel 431 and I was on 328 I cannot just enter the channel number because there are no numbers on the Remote.  That is a big enough flaw to return the TV I purchased.  One of the dumbest mistakes I have ever seen in technology.  I think the team at TCL really dropped the ball here.

I actually really liked that TV and it worked well for a desktop PC that I rarely use. I figured I didn't need to splurge for the 1080p version of this TV since the smaller resolution was perfectly fine for the few times I use my desktop PC. Unfortunately I realized when I hooked up the 720p version, the PC's resolution was actually 1080p, and it was showing through a 720p monitor... long story short, it looked very bad and I realized I had to return it and splurge for the 1080p option. Quick review of the 720p one: Great quality overall, I actually really liked the viewing angles and picture quality of that. I think it would make for a great TV, however for a PC it made the text a bit choppy and difficult to read, so I don't recommend it as that. The same day, I went and ordered this 1080p version. It is designed slightly differently but overall looks the same. Resolution is much better, makes everything on my PC look normal again. I am pretty disappointed with the viewing angles and brightness. The TV is almost darker around the edges. It almost looks like it fades into the edges, which is very strange. Viewing angles are atrocious, but part of that could be attributed to the strange darkness around the edges. Screen is pretty bright, in general for a budget TV I'm happy. But oddly enough the screen on my very old TV that I was using before almost seemed better. Let's just hope I get another 10+ years use out of this one!The setup was very, very easy. It tries to make you register for a Roku account however look carefully at all your options, you can choose to ignore the setup (it was completely unnecessary for me) and go straight to using it as a computer monitor. The setup however is pretty easy and self explanatory. The ""smart"" aspect of this TV works well, it's not laggy at all like other smart TVs I have (though they are older as well). I would totally suggest getting this if you plan on using it as an actual TV. As a PC monitor it's alright, but I can't help but feel like since you're looking at it closer up when as a PC monitor, it might be better to spend a little more for a better brand with a better quality panel. This here gets the job done but I'm not wowed. Another pro is that it is VERY, very light. I was shocked at how light it was. Definitely not what I'm used to from my older flat screen TVs!",2

The feature that impressed me the most is switching HDMI inputs via voice remote and it's super easy, just press the button say what the HDMI input is named and it switches.  The downside of voice remote is sometimes when voice searching it immediately after an input  its says ""installing (name of channel) and you can't stop it from installing and have to remove it later if you didn't want it or will just switch to Pandora if you have it. I also once had a brief problem with voice search hard to explain exactly the nature of it but I believe it was internet issues related (no issues with my  internet at the time)I went to ROKU's websight and ordered the voice remote ""for all ROKU TV's"" for 30 bucks plus tax and shipping.  Besides the voice feature its not a line of sight remote but uses radio waves so you can be in another room and control the TV.",2

I've never had this problem and still have strong connections on all my other devices, so troubleshooting 101 says its the tv.Update: This continues to be the worst tv.

","June 21, 2019",Yes,"I saw prior to ordering that this TV is noted for being somewhat fragile.  Sure enough, despite handling it with great care, upon power up it was quite apparent that the screen was badly shattered.  Front glass was intact.  Damage was only visible on power up where the screen's backlighting shone thru the damaged area.  Immediately contacted Amazon and got the replacement unit less that 24 hrs later.The second unit arrived intact, and has been quite impressive.  Great picture, and better sound than we expected for such a small TV.  We already have a Roku stick on one of our TVs, but this TV with Roku integrated into it is far faster in Roku menus and program selection.  We use it on the patio for baseball games and occasional TV watching, where it has been a big hit.  Was pleasantly surprised to find our entire Spectrum Cable channel line-up was available as an app on the Roku menu, meaning we can watch TV  over wifi, without a cable connection.Only negative might be if you aren't or don't want to be a Roku customer.  Signing into Roku or becoming a new Roku customer is pretty a much mandatory first step before using the TV.  You do not have to register a credit card to do this, though this will speed up any later purchases.",2

I live in an apartment with clearly marked buzzers &amp; they didn't even ring, just left it in the common area where anyone could've taken it... and the 'delivered' notification didn't show up until an hour later.

The only configuration we have to tweak is hooking satellite tv receiver up with the Roku—might have to use both remotes in order to choose channels from our dish satellite.  My husband and I spent more time attaching the screen to our stand than actually setting things up to play the tv.  We already had Roku so it was a matter of resetting password and following prompts from the screen.Some things to consider:1. Make sure your stands or wall mounts fit the hardware!  We had purchased this tv to replace a Toshiba HiDef that was about 10 yrs old.  I have bracket mounts showing right now.  Will conceal with some florals at the top of the mount.2.  You may need  speaker system for sound.  I did find settings a bit tricky to find.  Knowing how to navigate smart tv functions is a must—TCL doesn’t clarify the settings features with the tv in their user manual.  I simply hunted for proper screen settings—the black end screen bars can be stretched to fit the full screen.3.  We probably could have gotten the 50 inch tv to better fit our stand—the width of the screen is quite narrow on this model.  We were not sure how this tv would fit on our tv stand.Otherwise, so far so good!  My husband and I appreciate the affordability of this smart tv.  Just wished we had gotten a little bigger one for our stand.  This one is very nice for the money—our satellite channels are really beautiful pictures!!For a starter smart tv, this one is an excellent buy!

The person in India was nice but barely speaks enough English and had me bending over the television reading a tiny serial number with three back conditions and doing a bunch of troubleshooting tasks, when I had already followed the manufacturer's instructions to troubleshoot. Why not just send me a remote that might cost the company a dollar? Needless to say I was pleased with my previous TCL for the heavily discounted price.

It was a super easy to set up and Roku provides a much easier way of looking up your accounts ( Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, etc. ) and logging into them than anything else I have tried! The remote is simple af to use as there are big buttons on them for the popular Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, streaming services! Or you just simply go through the easily accessible menu interface and download/select what you want to use! The only downside to this TV is the sound quality is not that great.

When I called their customer support they did submit a ticket and state that my items would arrive in a week if the ticket was approved.

Even if you're not ready to install the display, take it out of the box and test it with a video signal generator application. (Easily found on the web). They will reroute you to TCL customer support to run you through troubleshooting. Once they realize it's a manufacturers defect, you will be rerouted back to Amazon customer support. They will replace the display at no cost. Being in the AV field, this kind of stuff happens all the time, especially with cheaper TV's. Have pictures of the dead/stuck pixel ready to send to TCL Support and make sure the whole TV is in the picture and note where the stuck/dead pixel is in the photo.

And a mute button.Ok, so I usually don’t write reviews, so this might not “flow” very well. I bought this as a gift for a friend whose TV had quit. Had it directly delivered to his house. He had it mounted on the wall and run through his cable but not connected with the Roku. So we(“I”) tried the code, it gave me the 800 phone number to call,as mentioned in several reviews here, where it costs $99 dollars to set up. I told friend that I needed the owners manual so I can call customer service. Long story short, hed misplaced it, I googled it, called them, walked us through it, here’s a very key point-you MUST have a Roku account set up!!! Maybe those codes would’ve worked from the beginning had friend had an account!!! Anyway, set up an account. There’s a place where it asks for payment information. Friend did not want to put in that. AND you don’t have to!! After it was all set up and we’d hung up with the nice representative in India. We connected to the cable and scanned for channels and then put it on the channel my friend had been watching in the living room. There was virtually NO SOUND!!! NONE!!! I went through every setting many times. Little to no change in volume. I was so disappointed. I was ready to print out a return label and pack it up and at least exchange if not return. I happened to mention that when I had had a Roku stick before it was really cool because you could download a remote onto your phone. And I still had it so I opened it to show him. It had VOLUME CONTROL BUTTONS!!!! I was able to turn the volume all of the way up and then us his cable control to control the volume after that. Such relief!!Another little glitch was the picture size. The picture wasn’t filling up the entire screen. So the next morning I called the TV manufacturer and while I was on hold the information that I needed was given to me. It said while you’re watching a program or movie and you want to adjust the size push the * button. I did it before the rep came back on the line and it worked!!So no return needed! So happy now, everyone is happy!I hope this review will help someone else because as I said I was really going to pack it up and send it back!Good luck!!👍🏻😎",2
3.0,"Basic TV with Roku remote - NOT good for Over-The-Air broadcasts - and NOT for older eyes
  
","December 16, 2019",Yes,"The TCL 32S327 is a lightweight basic TV with an easy set-up.It comes with a little Roku remote so its easy to use the built-in Roku app right away.  But this same remote makes watching Over-The-Air broadcasts a real pain.  You can't go to a channel directly because there are no numbers on the remote.  You have to tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap your way to the channel of your choice.  It can take 10 to 20 taps to get to the channel you want.The TV does a decent job of scanning for OTA channels with one HUMONGOUS, downfall - its impossible to add channels manually or to scan for additional channels.  The scan simply ERASES EVERY channel from memory and starts from scratch.  Its a HUGE problem for us because our channels are broadcast from more than one tower and we have to change the antenna position in order to get reception.  This means we can never, ever get all our channels recognized by the TV at the same time.  This is unforgiveably stupid.The picture quality is mediocre and dull.  There are no adjustments for contrast, color or shapness.  Brightness is barely adjustable at all - you can choose from Dimmer, Dim, Normal, Bright, Brighter.  Unfortunately, all of those options are dull.  Even the 'Brighter' option is dull.  The older members of your family are going to hate this TV because the picture will always be way too dim.  Another problem is - the TV screen is slow to respond.  It must have a low refresh rate.  Is things are moving on screen, the picture looks blurry.  Again - there are no settings to change.  It simply IS the way it IS.This TV would be best for an area subject to weather or damage - like a kid's playroom.  Its not good as a main TV.  Older people will hate the picture quality and the remote.  And anyone who regularly watches over-the-air broadcasts with an indoor antenna is going to be frustrated by the channel scanner and the poorly chosen remote control.",1

","September 3, 2019",Yes,"This is my game room/workout room TV. I bought it to replace a (more expensive when I bought it) Vizo that had something nasty fall on it and crack the screen. After having this running for a few weeks I'm really impressed by it. Picture is great for what it is. My main TV is a 4k Sony, so I've seen what a jaw dropping picture looks like. By comparison this won't be your centerpiece showoff TV (and won't set you back nearly as much), but it has a nice color depth, doesn't look washed out the way cheap sets usually do, and didn't take much tweaking to get looking how I wanted. As I write this I'm watching an episode of Stargate Atlantis on Amazon vid and it looks superb.The Roku OS works far faster than the Roku stick I had for a smaller TV I don't use any more. I like that it powers up to that simple, customizable Roku screen. The old Vizo wanted to come up to a kind of bloatware 'look at all these different channels you can sub to' screen, and occasionally would fall back to that if you tried to navigate to Netflix or Amazon video too soon after it powered up.I'm running the headphone line out to the input of a 2.1 speaker system I have. The volume is a little on the low side - I have to turn the volume on the external speakers up more than I had to with the Vizo. But so far I haven't had a case where either streaming service, connected Blu Ray player, or connected PC volume output can't go high enough for me. I can't speak to what the built in speakers sound like.I like that the remote is nice and minimalist. The only downsides so far are that with the volume rocker on the side I'll occasionally hit them on accident while I'm gripping it and trying to power up, resulting in it not doing anything until I change my grip. And also I can't seem to figure out how to get CEC to work with my Blu Ray player (the set may not support it, but it's not a burning need for me). Oh, if it'd had a dedicated button for Amazon video the way it has one for Netflix, Hulu, and ESPN would have been great, but that's at the level of 'would be nice if it came with an ice cream, too' - not deducting anything for not having that.All considered it's easily worth the mid 100s price point in my opinion. If someone broke in and stole this from me I'd replace it with the same thing again without hesitation.",2

If you're not a Roku user, the set up will be more cumbersome but the payoff is great. Roku is a fantastic ecosystem and i have used them all.Regarding signal quality for wifi... A non issue for me. I have Verizon FiOS with stock FiOS equipment kept hidden in a closet on the front side of the house. My tv is outside on the back patio maybe 30' from the closet, separated by two walls. I had the occasional hiccup but nothing worth talking about. That's just my personal experience. I get the impression people with connectivity issues have defective TV's,weak wifi signal from router, or distance issues. I can't say I've experienced anything like that.The quality is excellent in general, nevermind for the price. I'm using it outdoors, so naturally there is a fairly high glare at peak sunlight hours. However, I expect that and I'm not using it the way any manufacturer would advise me to, so I can't fault the product. The stock sound is pretty decent even outside but I did buy a bose soundbar for it. At this price, I could afford to do more than I could at another price point.Value for the money here is outstanding. I've been a Samsung snob my whole life.

It is very light for its size and hangs very nicely.I did not want a huge TV, since the bedroom is small, but it had to be 1080p.  I am surprised how many smart TVs this size are not 1080p.  Even the 17"" screen on my laptop is 1080p.  We often will connect a laptop to the TV to watch movies.The sound is very good too.  It is not theater sound, but very good for a $200 tv.  It is loud enough to easily hear over the rooftop A/C which sits between the TV and the bed (anyone that owns a RV knows even ducted rooftop A/C units are loud).It did take longer to setup over other TVs.  I did not see an option to skip the Roku setup, which is the most time consuming part, but it did go smoothly.  Connecting to our WiFi router (yes we have one in our travel trailer) was easy.  I have noticed that the TV, every once in a while, will claim it needs an internet connection even though it states it is connected when confirming the connection.  The WiFi router is less than 10 feet from the TV.I don't live the remote.  It is nice and smooth, which is great for our small bedroom, but there could be a lot more buttons.  It makes simple tasks more time consuming having to go through a menu.I also wish the Roku Media Player supported more video codecs.  We have a NAS in our travel trailer that contains all of our DVDs in digital format.  A lot of our older movies were ripped in AVI format and the media player does not support AVI.  It only seems to support MP4.For $200, I highly recommend this TV if you think you can deal with the very limited remote capability.",1

This TV got good reviews and the price was right.Setup was a breeze. If you're used to how Roku works, you will find the whole experience to be really easy and familiar.Sound is good. No distortion even when I bump up the volume. Is it surround sound with lots of base and whatnot? No, but it had good, solid sound and that's perfect for me.Image is good.

That could probably be fixed within settings if I wanted to bother fiddling with it, but it's fine.Functionality is great. I've had no issues with it. It actually responds faster than my old TV which is great.Honestly the only thing that bugs me (and the reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5) is the standby light at the bottom is this BIG square. Every other TV I've ever owned or even seen has a small red or green light for standby. But this is a square about the size of a silver dollar. Maybe even a little bigger.

It'd be fine fine in the living room or a den, but anywhere a person is trying to get some sleep...well, forget it! You got this bright light in your face.

","October 4, 2019",Yes,"This is a fantastic HDTV, and the bargain price is an added bonus. If you're familiar with Roku, this television has the Roku operating system built into the television. That means that a separate streaming box or streaming stick is unnecessary. Just connect the TV's wifi to your home wifi network, and you're good to go (this model does NOT have an ethernet port and is wifi only).I attached an external antenna to the TV when I received it, and scanned for over the air local channels, and was able to get over 50+ HD TV channels, which is perfect for cord cutters. I've found that the picture is outstanding with streaming content (Netflix Amazon Hulu Vudu), over the air signals, and average for cable television channels. Remember that the picture quality depends on your content source. A weak or diminished wifi signal will produce a weak picture. I read so many reviews that claim an HDTV has a lousy picture and they send the TV back or give it a one star review. All too often the consumer is unaware that a crappy picture can't be blamed on the TV. The television might be too far from the wifi router, or your home network could be overwhelmed and the wireless signal is too slow or diminished, or your over the air (OTA) signal needs a boost (and an amplified antenna).I can rave about the value and quality of this HDTV for hours and I'd bore you to death. This is my second TCL Roku HDTV, and when I'm ready to upgrade to 4K, I'm going to buy the TCL 55R617. If streaming is new for you, or you aren't familiar with the Roku platform, ask questions. Use Youtube instructional videos and amazon reviews to learn, and don't be afraid to ask questions. You'll be a streaming champ in no time! Especially if you buy this TV. You can't go wrong.

","August 2, 2019",Yes,"First, the ""bad"" part: I took advantage of a great sale on Prime Day and bought this TV, in part because we wanted a bigger TV in our den, and in part because the home theater system we have has streaming apps that will no longer be supported by Amazon and Hulu. When the TV arrived, the screen was broken. There was a pressure fracture right in the middle of the screen when turned on. A few clicks on Amazon's site, and I had a replacement TV on the way and a pre-paid mailing label. I was mildly inconvenienced by having to drive 5 miles to our local UPS pick-up location. The replacement TV arrived 5 days later (due to the weekend) and was in perfect condition.On to the TV: This is a budget smart TV. The speakers are good but not great. The picture is more than acceptable to me. The price was right. Options for the TV are good. You will need to have a Roku account to get the maximum benefits of this TV. The initial TV set-up is fairly intuitive. I had never heard of HDMI ARC until I bought this TV. Now, when I turn on the TV, it will also turn on my home theater system, put the system in the correct mode, and play through the home theater. If I turn off the home theater, the TV will then turn on its own speakers. Simple, but neat tech.My only complaint about this TV: It doesn't default to the last video setting when you turn it off and back on. My DirecTV Genie remote will turn the TV on and off (plus control the volume), but if I plop down in my chair and turn the TV on with the Genie remote, I will still need to have the TCL/Roku remote in hand to select satellite TV.Edit: I found the setting within the menu that allows the TV to automatically turn on the satellite TV.Last tidbits: Legs are easy to attach (watch!

The receiver on the TV is very bright.  If you are putting this in your bedroom and you like to sleep in total darkness, this isn't the TV for you.Also, something not too important, but worth mentioning: the power cord is pretty short.Other than that, then picture is great and the menu is designed really well.

The remote has some big favorites (NetFlix, HuLu, etc.) but it would be nice if you could have programmed them with ones you have.  I'm still using DirecTV which did recognize the TCL so I can turn on the satellite box and the TV with the DirecTV remote but you can't do that with the TCL remote.  Also, the TCL comes on and you need to select the input (HDMI 1,2, or 3).  It would have been nice if it came up with the last input used.  This is an issue since now I will need two remotes to use my setup. It is not an issue for me but guests will need to be trained.  The picture quality is great.  I was using an Amazon Fire stick for my streaming (NetFlix, HuLu, HBO Now and Prime).

The other is that the Roku does not have (at least, I haven’t found) the function of reducing the resolution to less than HD. Since I am in a rural area with horribly slow internet, this is a drawback. My solution is to run streaming through my kindle fire where I can reduce resolution, then screen mirror to the TV.

It frequently needs to reestablish connection to my internet and go through all the prompts to do this before loading different apps. This problem has become much more frequent since the purchase of the TV.

This is different it will not even start up completely without the Roku registration. My other concern is that it will turn into a doorstop if Roku decides to drop support or something.Roku IS free. You do not have to give them your credit card, but they do try to get it. You can by pass the credit card data with a link at the bottom of the page. The setup process is a bit of a hassle in my opinion.If you have a cable subscription don't go signing up for content you already have access too.

Thought it was just my network connection or the app itself.  Then there were intermittent audio issues where you could not hear audio on content at all (Netflix, Cable, aux).  However, the system sounds were still playing fine (power on/off, navigating options, apps, etc).  Weirdest issue I've ever encountered - and of course it all really hit a week after my return window closed.Worked with Amazon Customer Support and they refunded me.  So, no harm there, but extra aggravation means I'm not going to order this device again.",1

","March 2, 2019",Yes,"Thought I'd wait for awhile before I did a review just in case. So, after owing not quite a month now, I have to say I'm amazed at the quality for the price I paid. Just wanted to replace a 32in I had in my bedroom with something larger and spotted the TCL. Glad I did---sorry for those that DID have a problem (it's usually me) but I didn't  have any problem whatsoever. N O W----on to the BEWARE PART----When you google set-up it will direct you to a site (somewhere in India) that will try and sell you a subscription to activate. JUST HANG UP and go directly to TCL's own website. They are located in the Philippines but are understandable and very helpful. They will walk you thru the entire process. I have Comcast Xifinity cable so for those of you that do as well---the code for the remote to be recognized by the tv is 11756.  (The remote will work for all features but NOT the on-off or volume--this code will fix that) Also, Americas largest big box store (starts with a W) carries this same tv, but being a Prime member I received it 3 days earlier and the 4yr protection plan is $18 cheaper thru Amazon.

3.0,"Nice TV, Abysmal Documentation
  
","December 10, 2019",Yes,"Perfect size to fit in old school ""entertainment center"" formerly occupied by 26"" analog square tube set.  In this small 32"" format, 720p is completely adequate.  Bought just for local channel antenna TV.Documentation is severely lacking.  Only QucikStart guide is supplied with set, includes NO info on how to select Antenna TV Favorites or how to cull unwanted Antenna Channels.  At TCL support website, there is a full North American manual which covers this,  but it is for the entire ""3 Series"" so it also covers multiple features not supported on this low-end model.  Weird:  On the TCL USA website, the downloadable QuickStart Guide is for the Canadian model of the set.  TCL Cust Support claims ""it's the same manual"" but the model numbers do not match and the back page of the downloadable manual directs customers to TCL's Canadian website.Even if you plan to use this set only for Antenna TV, you still need a WiFi connection to update to the latest firmware.  If you use Whitelist MAC Addr filtering on your router, the TV's firmware will NOT display the the TV's unique MAC Addr until AFTER a WiFi connection has been established.  So you must disable Whitle List filtering, albeit only momentarily, to establish a WiFi connection, then and only then you can view the TV's MAC Address.  IMO, stupid cart-before-the-horse GUI design.Would I buy it again?  Actually, yes.  Now that I've scrambled up the learning curve on viewing the set's MAC Address and broken the code on the completely undocumented setting Antenna TV Favorites &amp; dulling completely unwanted stations, this little set is just fine.",0
3.0,"Less Than Happy
  
","June 12, 2019",Yes,"I did not intend to write a review but have changed my mind. I like the tv, and it meets my needs, which is background noise. Honestly, support, despite their touting it to the contrary, is nonexistent. When I tried online support, it was clear the agent was working with more than just me; responses took upwords of a minute. I finally gave up and asked for email support. The only emails I got warned me that (despite my response) if I did not respond in 3, then 5, days, they would close the issue. The issue was never addressed, or even mentioned. When I told them that I solved the issue despite their lack of support, the response was ""If you do not respond in 3 days we will close the issue."" I begged them to close the issue and stop sending me emails. It did not help. When I emailed for support from crackle, I got the same useless support; in fact, it appeared to be the same group doing the support. When I figured out that programs were constantly loading because of the way commercials are addressed (they are not integrated like they were when I was a lot younger; instead, they start up randomly, typically in the middle of a sentence), I thought my issue was over. However the ROKU channel still complains frequently that my wireless connection is not fast enough. I have checked it numerous times, including immediately after a ROKU complaint. ROKU recommends 3Mpbs download speed; I have a minimum of 9Mpbs and frequently over 10Mpbs. My provider guarantees 8Mpbs. I am a widower with no one using my wireless connection but me. This problem occurs exclusively on the ROKU channel. What does happen on every channel is, consistently when I first turn on the tv, I am told the wireless connection cannot be found; however, when I restart, the connection miraculously appears. Finally, I thought it was illegal to up the audio gain for commercials. I can have the sound turned down to the point that I can barely hear it during the program and be blasted out of the house when the commercials come on. I rated the tv overall a 3; it probably deserves a 5. ROKU deserves a 1 for service and technology. Overall the average is a 3.",1
2.0,"Good Features, Mediocre Picture (Updated Review)
  
","November 23, 2019",Yes,"After trying to get used to the picture on this TV, we finally decided to get a Fire Stick and go back to our 2016 LG SmartTV because the picture was so much better. They are both cheap TVs but the LG produces a deep, crisp image from any angle and the TCL suffers badly by comparison. It's washed out and kinda milky no matter how I adjust the image and totally washed out from an angle. I'm pretty disappointed by this TV. It's in the guest bedroom now but I'd almost be embarrassed to have guests watch anything on it. Roku is a good service and deserves a better TV to be viewed on.Picture quality is decent but not as good as our LG 32"" LED TV, which has pretty amazing  clarity for a $160 TV. I'd really like a manual option for antenna channels along with the auto search. The remote is nice and sleek and has excellent functionality. A keypad so I don't have to scroll through the broadcast channels one by one would improve it dramatically for me. I like the Roku home page.  Since I don't really use Hulu or ESPN it would be nice to be able to change the presets at the bottom of the remote to take me to, say, Prime or antenna. It's pretty amazing how much louder or softer some channels, apps and shows are from each other, perhaps even more so than on the LG; I had thought this was a problem with the LG interface but it's obviously more widespread. I'll go from a volume setting of 16 being perfectly loud on one show and then have to push it up to 50 to hear another. There's enough user control over picture and sound to satisfy my desires. The interactive set-up was smooth and easy, changing settings and device names is fairly intuitive. The sound, as on all the other back-firing flat TVs I've seen, is thin and harsh when it's set to an audible, clear tone. Once I've added a sound bar (hoping for a Black Friday steal on something halfway decent) I think it'll be perfectly adequate in our tiny living room.",0

4.0,"Excellent picture and features for price
  
","September 26, 2019",Yes,"Only have had this TV operating for a few days so cannot comment on longer term reliability but I can say that the picture and included ROKU capability are excellent.The remote has limited functionality by itself (it needs the TV to do some things) and the setup can be confusing since it starts with setting up ROKU.  I'm not sure how I did it by I managed to bypass the ROKU set up and get the TV itself working and where I was able to ""tune"" color, sharpness and so forth.Once that was done I felt more comfortable tackling ROKU set up which needs an Internet connection for the TV as well as your own PC or phone to start the ROKU application there so that you can register the TV using a code the TV displays during the process.  Having to do this in two places (TV and app on another device) complicates the process a bit but while challenging is not impossible.Once you have completed the registration process you can access ROKU from the TV.  There are included apps on ROKU (don't know if they were free or billable) but I was only interested in Prime and Netflix which I was able to download from ROKU.  Once they were downloaded I could sign-on to each using my existing account information.It took a while and a couple of false steps but finally it was done.  Probably would be a challenge for those without at least a minimum level of knowledge into the complexities of smart TV's.  Would be easier if the TV defaulted to TV setup mode first, allowing you to later add ROKU if you want/need it since most would feel comfortable and familiar plugging it in and making a TV connection.  As a TV it is excellent at the price point, and ROKU is a nice benefit, but setting up ROKU to get to the TV might be frustrating.",0
5.0,"Very Nice TV
  
","April 20, 2019",Yes,"The Good:1. The TV is fairly easy to setup. I only had one hiccup and that was when I installed the Roku app on my phone and tried to use the remote control feature. The app couldn't connect to the TV at first, but after restarting both devices it worked fine and continues to work fine. Oh, and I should also note that I had no trouble connecting the TV to my 5GHz wifi.2. Using the Roku app you can take advantage of your smart device's keyboard and voice recognition rather than having to type things using the remote control's arrow keys to select one letter at a time. This is a HUGE win for me, I hate typing things one letter at a time in this manner. You can even use your smart device to provide user names and passwords for streaming services in this way, which is VERY HELPFUL. I can't praise this feature enough, very nice.3. The TV is very responsive. Selecting things with the remote is quick, very little lag time between my button press and seeing the results on the screen. I hate interfaces that are too slow, so this is another BIG win for me.4. It doesn't weigh that much for being a pretty big TV. This helps with wall mounting.5. The wall mounting screws are VESA 200x200mm so that makes using a wall mount quite easy.6. Picture quality and volume seem great, though I haven't watched it that much yet.7. There is a setting to turn off the standby LED light. This is a simple feature, but a great one if you want the room dark when the TV is off.The Bad:1. The TV only came with 2 of the 4 screws needed for wall mounting. The wall mount I purchased, however, did have 4 compatible screws with it so I simply used those.2. The power cable is too short for my situation. I installed it above a dresser in a bedroom so I needed the cable to reach the floor (ideally) but it's too short to do so.Other:You do have to create a Roku account to use streaming features with this TV, but it is completely free. You can OPTIONALLY add a credit card in case you want to use premium content features. When signing up it can look as if you are required to provide a credit card, but there's a ""skip this"" type of link at the bottom if you don't wish to.",0

Every now and again I experience network glitches, but that's to be expected and the glitches are few and far between.So, when I discovered these TCL units on Amazon, my curiosity was peaked. I researched and read the reviews. Decided to buy the 32"" unit. Was delivered in two days.Setup was very easy. Hardest part was trying to find where I had recorded my WiFi hub password. With the password in hand and entered  into the system, we were off. Programming (software updates) took a few minutes, but went quite quickly.The picture quality is awesome! I am very pleased with this television. Sound is great and overall quality of the unit is great. Once I discovered how to disable the LED standby light, which is very easy by the way, I am a happy camper.Oh, it should be mentioned that I did have to move my WiFi hub a few feet.  You see I placed this TV at the farthest corner of my home so the signal was a little weak and I experienced the occasional ""Buffering"" message. Now that my hub has been re-positioned,  allowing for a more direct signal, we are good to go.Bottom line? I would definitely recommend one of these new TCL units. Matter of fact I am currently contemplating purchasing a 43"" unit to replace my old 36"" Philips unit. Only thing stopping me is that the Philips is still orking so darn good.",0

With my file being 450 mb's this bar shows for a couple seconds, but there is no way around this other than smaller file size. A 50mb file had no loading screen, but I want quality and that takes larger size, so I would have to live with it.The only other issue is that there is no resume feature after a power loss. Being from a coastal town the power is a little iffy. One plus is that screen stays black and doesn't resume on the red roku screen.I made the mistake of calling ""tech support"". Unless you are severely tech impaired, don't waist your time. Indian women reading off screens from forums and such is NOT support. The 3 times I called it took them almost a min to say ok after I asked about loading screen, and none of them were capable of an answer. 5 emails have gone unanswered.

But one of the channels I'd want is not available on the Samsung Tizen platform, but *IS* on Roku.  OK, so either I can buy a more prestigious brand TV, *and* pay for a separate Roku (or similar), or I can take a chance on this TCL that already has a full Roku built in.  The reviews looked good, and I already was familiar with the Roku platform...so why not?Really this is a fantastic television, especially for the price.  Every pixel is good, the styling is even reasonably nice, low power consumption, etc.  The only thing (and this is a true nit-pick here), but when set at maximum brightness, it's about ""normal"" brightness on one of the more expensive televisions.  I think the specs bear that out--the screen luminosity is a bit less than more expensive units.  But it's still plenty luminous, and this television is a slam-dunk for a secondary TV.  I don't think this is what you want for the main family room tv (though it would be ok), but this is great for a bedroom or office secondary tv.  And the price is just insanely good.I have the 32"" version, it is very light.  The small VideoSECU wall mount is more than sufficient for it, if you're considering a wall mount.Buy buy buy!",0

Somehow we were not informed that this had  again changed and it was delivered on Wednesday when we were not at home.

The option to change the picture settings while watching a channel (i.e. Netflix, VUDU), I was able to make the TV look even better.  Furthermore, I was able to free up an HDMI port (since I had my old Roku Stick plugged into it).  Now, I can plug in another gaming machine for my room!  Overall, a very accommodating TV... with a few issues...The issues I would have is that the TV takes a while to set up.  This is the least of the problems (unless you don't have WIFI).  Second, setting up all the subscription channels can also take up a bit of time (depending on the channel).  The TV also feels a bit flimsy (possibly from being lightweight); however, once attached to the stands, it shouldn't be too much of a problem.  Lastly, I have noticed that TCL had removed the ""Expert Picture Mode"" from their Roku apps.  This was a bit disappointing, since I'm not able to adjust the RGB colors, noise reduction, and certain gamma aspects.  While the TV picture can be adjusted, the lack of the previously mentioned settings prevent me from tweaking it even further.In conclusion, the TCL 32S327 32-Inch TV is great and I highly recommend it!!!  :D",2

Bottom line is that without trouble shooting to try to make the remote work, TCL will not replace it. I called the technician that installed the TVs and he is going to call TCL to explain about the remote, but if he has to come to my house to trouble shoot, I am sure I am going to have a service charge that may be more than the cost of the TV! What is crazy is that if I was able to take the TV off the wall mount, packaged it up and returned it to Amazon they would replace the whole TV! All I want is a replacement remote!

No calls to make, no fraudulent websites to confuse me.Packaging: Came unharmed. But I can see how damage could happen if a sloppy shipper or warehouse worker mishandled it. The tape around the edges resisted in some spots so, remembering the bad reviews, I was cautious in removing it. Maybe they paid attention to bad reviews because it came off smoothly with no damage to the screen or finish.Remote: Remember, it *is* a Roku remote and they are all a little slow. Personally, I found it slightly more responsive than the remotes for the stand alone Roku. It can be annoying typing in complex passwords though. So if the Roku channel gives you the option to sign in via the computer, it might be less frustrating.Longevity: I’ve only had it for a day, so it’s too early to tell.This is my first experience with 1080p and smart TV.

These will ALWAYS take you somewhere even when you do not have accounts.  You cannot reprogram them.  You cannot disable them.  If you google reprogramming you will find a lot of annoyed people who actually remove the button and fill it in to stop it from being so annoying.  This is particularly annoying when other roku-tv-remotes have other choices (such as Amazon).  TCL says that they have no other (eg. aftermarket universal) remote recommendations.  They did however help me to set up the page I want to see when the tv first comes on (it doesn't have to be the home page that is cluttered with all the stuff you don't have).Mechanically, the tv seems great.  The picture is very sharp and clear -- better than the Vizio tv it replaces although both had the same resolution.

However, you do NOT have to input any credit card information and if you go slow, you can get through it easily enough without any calls to an 800 number. Since I already have Netflix, HBO, Showtime and Amazon Prime, I was able to activate all of those accounts by syncing them with my cable service and installing the apps using the voice prompt. Example, I used the app voice feature and spoke ""HBO"" The TV asked if I wanted to install it and I used the up down arrow to say yes on the TV.

I promised myself I would make my next television purchase a TCL Roku TV. I am in love with the Roku product. It makes television watching easier and brainless. Once you install your apps on one device, they automatically synch with every other Roku device on your account.One element of caution: While the product itself is amazing, the customer service is not! I purchased the TV Black Friday 2018, but my home was undergoing renovation, so I did not open the box until March 2019. Yes, 4 months later.  I thought the box was missing the feet stabalizers. So I called the company to see if they could send replacements or if I could purchase replacements. The TCL representative was rude and told me that parts were not covered in the warranty and there was nothing he could do as my purchase was over 30 days old. Then he told me to go back to whoever I purchased it from  He never even tried to work with me at all. And I would have been fine with paying for replacement part--I understood it was my fault for not inspecting the purchase when I made it.I was extremely disappointed with this service. It turned out that the parts were simply in a different area than expected and than usual. So I was happy to be able to use my purchase, even if TCL was totally unwilling to assist me in doing so. After reading their warranty information, I should have had absolutely no problem with obtaining parts, because parts are included. If you have any problems with the television, do not wait!

At least is not bad, which is often the case in cheaper TVs so marking that as a highlight- a good assortment of apps enhance its functionality as a smart TV. Signing up for FREE Roku membership, user doesn’t need a Fire TV or Chromecast to access Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, and a variety of cable channelsOpportunities:- relies on the remote for virtually any operation so you have to keep it handy as well as a set of spare batteries (otherwise can’t use TV)- along the same lines, the button installed at the center base is such a great idea. It could have more functionality: allow it to navigate the menus (up, down and sideways) as well as the enter / confirm gesture. That would give a certain level of independence from the remote control in that image rotation functionality- image rotation works.

Unlike a regular Roku remote, it uses line-of-sight signal which means you have to point the remote at the TV with a clear path to the bottom of the screen to make it work. Roku remotes use radio signals which means you can point it in any direction, but not this one.2. The button press experience with this remote is lousy because we can press a button, hear the click, knowing it is pointed correctly, and still have nothing happen. Then we press again and maybe we still get nothing, or maybe it works. The whole experience is unpredictable and frustrating.3. The volume controls are on the side but a little underneath which means you have to hold it just right to press the volume control without pushing it out of your own hand. You cant just adjust the volume while it is lying on a surface but you have to pick it up.4. The plastic surface of the remote is too slick, more slick than a real Roku remote, which means that it really can slip out of your hand if you dont hold it right.I find myself tempted to buy a separate Roku just so I dont have to use this stupid remote.",1

My only negative is that the “stand” is flimsy.I would love it if I could control all tv functions from the remote.Edit:  I suddenly noticed that the audio and video were not in sync, only on this TV.  I googled and found solutions in TCL's support site.  Lots of other owners were asking about this problem in various TCL tvs, so not a new problem.",1

","August 18, 2019",Yes,"I bought this on the 2019 Prime Day for use in a spare bedroom and have been very happy with the product. The Roku interface is more user friendly than our Fire sticks. The fire sticks constantly point back to Amazon video whereas the Roku interface makes it easy to toggle to cable/antenna or any of the great apps available for Roku. The menus are easy to access and understand. The picture is great for the price. One con are the tv legs. They are too light for the tv and I could early see it tipping over with a slight touch. I replaced the legs with a tv stand but was annoyed that the legs provided were so flimsy. The other shortcoming is the remote. There is no previous channel option or ability to type in a channel number.  This isn't our primary tv so it's less of an issue for us, but bear that in mind if you are going to be channel surfing instead of watching through apps.",0

Can't really hear well if you take it outside or on the pool deck.  Another problem is that they don't work with and HDMI to connect to a receiver (even though it says they do), and the speaker attachments (red, yellow, white) don't work either.  I think this may be an compatibility conflict as I don't think these originated in the US.  They don't work with blue tooth speakers either.  The only speakers that work with this are the clunky ROKU brand speakers that are $200 (Which is more than the TV itself costs).",1

I'll point the remote right at the tv and sometimes it just wont work. You can't just point the remote in the direction of the tv , you have to really aim it. I have to be way to precise for the tv to pick up any button pressing from the remote, it's stupid.You can dim the screen but it's still pretty bright if you want it dim at night.Overall its a pretty solid tv it's just the one thing I NEED to control it is frustratingly un-operatable 85% if the time.

I’m still learning what else is offered but I feel like there’s a lot more that have yet to to discover.Size: I chose the 42” because I have a small living room area. Honestly, I could have gone a bit bigger but I think this size is just fine for now. The TV is super thin and stands no nicely. I was able to screw in the little stands myself in less than 10 minutes.Overall Thoughts: Fantastic purchase for a first time Smart TV buyer. Price is unbeatable. Setup of TV and ROKU was so easy.

I tried to program the cable box remote to do the power/volume but none of the codes work and I know what I'm doing.If you only want to use apps then I guess it's OK, if you want to watch a cable tv box it's a piece of steaming garbage.",0

The sensor problem got even worse and after a call with customer support they sent me an email today saying I have to ship the TV back for repair which will take 7-10 business days.... about two weeks total once you include shipping to and from. This is utterly ridiculous. I’m super disappointed that the only solution is to repair the broken “new” TV I purchased a little over two months ago instead of sending an actual new one.

The remote has only a few simple buttons and the main menu you see when you turn on the TV is super intuitive and very easily customizable.I hate having 2 remotes or having to explain to a guest how to work the remote for my TV. With this TV the user interface is terrific , the picture quality is fantastic and even the sound is better than I expected for this price point.

I was a bit worried about the 720p picture quality over the 1080p but IM CHEAP and you cant beat that price! That being said im totally impressed with this TV. There are plenty of smart settings that will let you create a plentifully beautiful image so that put to rest my 720 fears. The remote is clever and give you the access to EVERYTHING you could possibly want to stream! I had no idea how many options there are out there.The feature I was by far the most surprised about was the SOUND. The speakers are plenty loud, clean, and will  efficiently balance the voices so you dont have to worry about that obnoxious thing where battle scenes are loud but the voices are muddy and hard to hear so you turn it up only to get BLASTED by the next loud scene and your wife yells at you to turn it down/up/down🤬!  I was going to get some external speakers for it but I really dont think I need to anymore. Not sure why they dont show this off on their page, I sure would.In conclusion... I am totally pleased with this purchase. The size, price, quality, features all make for an easy, solid, would purchase again 5/5 stars.

","November 12, 2019",Yes,"I succeeded in setting up this TV, and it works, but I had trouble with the set-up instructions that use names for assorted connectors I'd never heard of and that matched only a few of the labels on the backs of my other associated appliances. When I looked up those terms on the internet, they'd never heard of some of them, either, so I gave up on the instruction manual and just figured out on my own what seemed like it should be connected to what. That worked. Also, if you have a satellite dish and click on satellite when asked to do so, the TV tells you you don't have one, and the whole set-up process grinds to a halt there. I eventually figured out that you're required to pretend and claim to have an antenna. That's the only way to get this TV to work with a dish. Also, the instructions claim that your package includes an AV input cable adapter. That is not true. I expect you'll pay for one, as I assume I did, but if you actually need it, you're going to have to pay for it again when you buy it from a company that actually carries them. Maybe Amazon? Lastly, I sure do miss those primitive bad old days when all I had was one crummy remote. Now, with this TV's updated technology, I get to use two of them just to tune in a TV program. Maybe that has something to do with owning a purely theoretically imaginary satellite dish. Wouldn't you just love a product you could just plug into the wall and turn on? Now that would be a genuinely impressive technological achievement.",0

I had no issue with setting it up, and have been very satisfied with all the smart features and picture quality since setting it up. My only complaint about this product is the remote; it's pretty terrible. I don't know if this is a common issue, or if it's just the one I received, but the buttons on my remote consistently do not work. Whenever I use the remote (which is every time I watch TV), I have to repeatedly press the buttons until they work. This is an even more annoying issue when you realize you have to use arrow buttons on the remote to navigate the Roku OS. Whenever I want to watch a YouTube video or search for shows/movies, because I have to use the arrow buttons to navigate through the on-screen keyboard and type a show or video title. The remote buttons constantly don't register clicks, or click a letter twice leading to a lot of frustration when trying to watch something. Luckily, there's a Roku smartphone app, which can act as a better-functioning remote. I just wish the remote it came with worked better.

There is simply no way I can ignore a bright blue line when something is supposed to be white. So I guess this is why the TV is $200. Back to Amazon it goes. Such a shame.",1

It's easy to use with the Roku menus, easy to set up, Was worried that it would be low quality, but it was very nice.  The only problem I have is the type of remote.  On my plug in Roku it has a remote that you don't have to even point at the screen.  On this one, you have to extend your arm and be very accurate or it doesn't work right.  You really have to aim closely.  The other remote you could be a room away and it worked anyway.

With that I solved several problems: hulu and the roku channel are now accessible, there is a search option and there are more options available.

Even tough the remote has a Hulu button I have not been able to find and add the channel. Netflix works fine. I tried to connect a wireless keyboard using the USB port, which has worked on the PC, Android boxes and some other smart TVs, but it just does not work and it makes searching for anything very tedious.

Setup was easy AFTER I got past the questionable websites that come up when you enter the info shown on initial power-up into your browser.

Connect ONLY to the authentic ROKU website.  Many others have commented on this.  Check out the other reviews that discuss this problem.  When you go to Roku.com the process is easy and painless.  It even remembered all my previous settings from my older Roku stick.  I was up and running in about 10 minutes.  Remember - IT SHOULDN'T BE DIFFICULT!.  If you are having a problem, then suspect a scam.  DO NOT give anyone your password over the phone.  You DON'T NEED telephone help on this.  You can do it yourself on the authentic ROKU site.The questionable sites give you a phone number to call where they try to extract info from you, including your Roku password, credit card, etc. (it is an obvious foreign ""call center"", based on the accents and background noise).  If you question the authenticity of their site they reply ""Well, you called ME, so it must be OK”.  You are much better off if you just use a PC to log-in to ROKU.com to create your account, or change your password (if you have a previous ROKU account but forgot the password, like me).  You WILL need a credit card if you plan to purchase any extra services - which I haven't - but they do go through a secure process for any needed personal information.

Feel free to scroll for other free movies.""  Which, of course, is when you resist throwing the junky remote at the screen and simply shut the SOB off.

I did not realize that the tv does not have any buttons to operate the tv without the remote. I tried reseting the tv (which I believe disconnected it from my internet connection), and still could not get it to work. After that I downloaded the app to use as a remote but it would not connect, because I think when I re-set the tv it disconnected from the internet, therefore I could not get the app to connect to the tv. So it was pretty much useless without a remote. Called customer service and they are sending one, but over a week later and I am still waiting. I like the TV, but wasn't impressed that with how fast I had issues with the remote and how slow the service is, especially since it is useless without a remote. Hopefully when I get a new remote it will work flawlessly. The tv itself seems nice. Good picture, good price, good feeatures with the built in roku and channel options.",1

I was expecting to get the quality I paid for, but in all honesty this tv is such an incredible deal. The quality of the plastics and stand is top notch. The remote is very responsive and typical of a roku remote. If you have not handled a roku remote, than you should know that these are minimalistic and do not have the standard remote setup. The roku feature was also very responsive. As fast, if not faster than a standard roku external player. I was expecting a slow UI, but this TV is fast. I already had a roku account setup, so getting the tv up and running was a breeze.Also, for a 720p, the image quality is great. I compared it to another budget 1080p TV and I was blown away by the image quality of this inexpensive TV - even the kids noticed that the image quality was better than the 1080p ""cheap"" TV.An incredible deal for a small TV.",0

Upon initial installation, the menus and remote were slow to respond. Luckily, there was an update. Surely that must fix it; it did not.First, scrolling through menus and using the remote for keyboard purposes is a lesson in frustration. Every one to two clicks the TV stops functioning for three to five seconds while it processes your click. Typing my information into Netflix took a solid three minutes.Second, Amazon Prime Video and Music do not install. I have tried power cycling and even a factory reset in order to get Amazon to install. Maybe it is not just Amazon products, but it seems suspicious that the other apps I've installed (Netflix, Plex, Youtube) all installed properly and work fine. I do not know if this is an Amazon problem or TCL problem, but it is a problem and detrimental to the TV.

","December 25, 2019",Yes,"During the couple of weeks I have had this tv I have had a blast. It's smart features are amazing, the user interface is simple and easy to navigate, and the picture quality is great considering the price. However, there are two things that bug me about the tv, two things that should be an easy fix in newer models: the remote and backlight bleed. The remote is good in and of itself. However, you have to point it directly at the sensor on the tv for it to receive inputs, and even then it's spotty. Thankfully there is the Roku app that functions as a flawless remote. The second issue is backlight bleed around the edges of the screen. The edges of the screen are clearly brighter than the rest of the screen. It's a small issue, but it is a bit of an annoyance. I'd doesn't, however, diminish from my viewing experience much at all. Overall, this is a great tv for the price, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a smart TV on a budget.",0

I have to be somewhat close to the tv for it to work, and it needs to be pointed at the perfect angle. Not a problem since my couch is close, but something to keep in mind.

","November 12, 2019",Yes,"I bought this as a splurge purchase when I saw it on sale as part of one of those ""limited time deals."" I've had a 32-inch TV for the last six years that's never been a problem, but wanted to upgrade my living room TV in my new apartment - the purchased was immediately-justified upon unboxing.Color and picture are great, and the smart features are more useful than I had initially thought they would be. I don't have cable and instead pay a la carte for Sling channels and Sunday Ticket that I normally would stream through my PS4. The TCL has Sling and Sunday Ticket apps, allowing me to cut out that middle man.I can't say this TV is worth the $650 price tag that it goes for retail because I didn't buy it at that price.

Streaming Spectrum and Amazon Prime, and also pulling cable from the living room box over a coax line (480P but gives the wifi a rest, perfectly fine for watching news and such).

We have a few people staying in our basement for the time being and felt a TV was a great addition. Nothing too fancy, but also not junky either. This TV was the best deal, great price. You can change the sound &amp; picture quality all in your settings bar. Set up was simple, easy and quick. You can also choose which apps you'd like to add to your homepage, as well as remove at any time. I don't know why some people are so harsh and negative on their reviews.

This is not good sound direction.You will need to buy external speakers and an amp to improve the sound quality. It will not work with wireless speakers except with the Roku wireless speakers.

","December 15, 2019",Yes,I've had this TV for little over a month and I think it lasted a couple weeks before the first problems came up. Setting it up was easy which was really nice but that's the only good thing I can say about this TV (why I gave it 2 stars). The first problem I ran in to was the display randomly being screwed up when I first turned it on... requiring a normal reset to fix it. The next problem that occurred was the WiFi randomly losing connection because your TV can no longer locate any wireless devices... requiring a normal reset to fix it. At this rate I don't know how long this TV is going to last before it completely breaks but since it was cheap I'll just ride it out and avoid this brand when I'm forced to buy a new one.,0

Worked fine last time used it but screen is showing spider web cracks the next time I went to use it and it wasn't moved or touched in between. Cheap TV with ZERO durability and the remote sucked if you weren't right up on it. WiFi signal is terrible and it would drop connection numerous times when I had no other issues with other devices using WiFi.
