I never had another phone where the sound just gets blocked somehow when holding it on the side. Another thing it that the aspect ratio of the phone is weirdly long so the screen just looks weird to me. I'm not sure if I'm remembering this part correctly but the even the blue light filter sucked. It just goes from white to super yellow and no inbetween. Lastly this is probably just because I'm used to a large size phone instead of a regular one, but the text is so tiny.

5.0,"Overall Good Value
  
","May 15, 2019",No,"This phone does as well as my Pixel 2XL did, for half the price.Pros: low cost, incredible camera, Google ecosystem, battery life, headphone jack.Cons: slightly buggy phone app, cheaper materials, not quite waterproof, lack of wireless charging, no earbuds included.I was a bit hesitant to risk upgrading, but I'm so glad that I did. I bought the 3A XL in Purple-ish, and the color is gorgeous. The battery life has been great, surprisingly better than my Pixel 2XL. Please note that I did disable some digital wellbeing features within an hour of initial setup, which has increased the speed and saved some battery. The display is nice, and bringing back the headphone jack was a pleasant surprise (I don't know about you but I was CONSTANTLY losing my 'dongle' when I actually needed it).However, there are a few major features lacking on this model vs the 3XL, primarily lack of wireless charging and waterproofing. Another major difference is the materials are definitely cheaper. It doesn't look or feel as cheaply made as say, the iPhone 5C did. The back simply doesn't have quite the same glow as the 2XL or 3XL. I would definitely recommend getting a screen protector on the device immediately before use, as the glass on the front isn't as durable. That said, it doesn't really look or feel cheap, just not built as premium as other Pixel devices.I could probably write an entire page about how incredible the camera is, but it's something you really just need to experience for yourself. Night Sight blew my mind. I took pictures of my living room in nearly pitch black darkness and a) I was able to see more in the photo than I could with my naked eye in the dark and b) it honestly looked like the time of day the photo was taken was about 4pm with the amount of light in the image. Portrait mode on any Pixel is fantastic. I have been asked if many pictures that I have taken on Pixel phones are professional photographs, and I am really not the best photographer.I do feel the need to mention that the phone app still has some kinks to work out, but I'm confident from my past experience with Google that it won't be long before its fixed. I have noticed that sometimes on calls, the phone has issues with displaying contact names on screen when I switch from one call to another. Luckily, there is an option built into the device's settings to immediately talk with Google support live agents via chat. I did this with ZERO wait time. Super helpful!Considering upgrading from an iPhone? I would recommend ignoring other online reviews that advise you against it and just go for it. (Just remember if you have a newer iPhone, make sure to compare features on your current device such as wireless charging first). My inital experience going from Apple to Google (iPhone to the Pixel 2XL) was seamless. Everything transferred via the cord and adapter given in the box. (Minus my collection of Apple music of course, but that's what Spotify is for!)New to Google? The Google ecosystem works incredibly well as a whole. I have Google smart home products in my home, and use Google photos and Gmail/google calendar/g suite etc. I'm amazed every day by new ways that everything works together.Lastly, THE PRICE! A new release, good quality phone at this low of a cost? It's a GAME CHANGER. This was the deciding factor for me choosing to upgrade, and it's absolutely worth the cost. In fact, a phone with this good of a camera at this cost is basically a steal.",525
5.0,"Great phone; my second Pixel!
  
","May 17, 2019",No,"I work in IT and know how to use phones fairly extensively. You should know one thing going into buying the Pixel 3a: it comes with Google's Pixel launcher, meaning that the interface that you're probably use to with other phones (Samsung, Xperia, iPhone, whatever else) is different here. It's a lot simpler to use, and keep in mind if you don't like it, you can download something different from the Play Store.Photos look excellent in my opinion (see my attached photo), navigating around the phone and apps works very quickly, and cell service (T-Mobile) has worked perfectly so far. The phone doesn't have much grip to it, so I recommend buying a case for it.Overall, great phone!",519

","May 25, 2019",Yes,"This is my 48- to 72-hour review.I bought this to replace a Moto G4 Play that had served me well but was on its second battery and occasionally locked up on me requiring me to remove the battery to reboot.As I had become a Moto fan thanks to my G4 Play, I was looking at the G7 Play and Power.  For a bit more, the G7 looked worth considering, then the Pixel 3a came out for the same price if you take the $100 gift card into account.  I read several reviews, and the better camera sold me.  I jumped in, taking the Amazon gift card offer over the Best Buy offer.The phone looks good, still fits in my pocket and I can easily use it with one hand.  The screen looks sharp and I really like the camera after a day or two of playing a little bit.  I still need to learn more about it. I LOVE the call screening feature which I'm not sure is Pixel specific or the operating system.I switched my service over Thursday night but needed a new, smaller SIM card which ATT gave me as I continued service with them.Friday, I was on the phone off and on throughout the day, mostly setting it up, adding my work email and calendar, etc.  I also took a walk around my campus with it, testing out the camera on about a dozen photos.  By the time I got home from work, the battery was down to 17 percent.  17!  I had read that this didn't have a great battery, but that it would get me through the day.  5pm won't cut it.So, what can you decide in one day?  I got up this morning, Saturday, and did some surfing, and played some online games.  Now, my game playing is limited to word puzzles and backgammon, not graphics-intensive games.  The battery, which was charged the night before, was down to 37 percent before noon.  I'm now very concerned about using this during an upcoming trip, or relying on it for work or travel.  I really like the phone, but this can't continue.  I may need to return it.  Is anyone else having battery problems like this.On the plus side, the included charger recharges the phone pretty quickly.  But I'm not going to have the time, or outlets, to keep charging it while playing tourist.",210
5.0,"Bought it on the day Google announced it
  
","May 17, 2019",No,"I've never spent more than $200 on average for a phone.  I paid the price with suspect quality, since I mainly bought new Android phones for that price range.  Every phone didn't last more than two years, most even started to have issues after a few months (i.e. GPS losing accuracy, charging slot losing contact, etc.)  Of course the OS never gets updated so you set yourself up to be hacked on an old, unpatched release.  The worst is the camera varying degrees of terrible.  So I bought a prepaid iPhone 6 about 1.5 years ago but you know how well iOS runs on old hardware and it will probably not make the jump to the next update.No matter how much I tried to convince myself, I just couldn't buy a new XR, even after I sold my DSLR (b/c I just never bring it with me no matter how good the pictures/lens is/was).  However, when Google launched this phone, my last international family trip convinced me that I need to jump at the chance - pictures you have forever, you want the best camera/phone to capture your experiences.  Plus, they are offering an insane $250 trade-in for my iPhone and $100 from the Google store credit, plus my company is giving me $100 for BYOD, so the phone is essentially free to me.Ordering was flawless, plus they (I ordered from the Google Store) provided a trade-in kit at the same time.  I got it in 2 days after Google announced it.  Box was your typical white box, looks almost exactly like a Apple box with color, design, packaging, etc.  Phone powered right up.  Slight hiccup to get it activated on Sprint in that you can't just move the nano SIM card over, you have to go to a Sprint store and activate a completely new SIM.  Also make sure it's a corporate store b/c affiliates don't seem to have these SIMs.  I went to Best Buy and they had me running in 20 minutes.Phone is awesome.  I got the XL and it's large but for a person who wears glasses it just makes it easier to do things.  I know people say it's not fast but I don't game or edit videos so it's plenty fast/responsive.  Most importantly, the camera is awesome.  Photos are not blurry so far and super clear.  I haven't even used any of the special portrait and night options.  I'm telling you if a camera can take low light photos that is golden and why I jumped at it.  Even with a DSLR it's a challenge trying to take low light photos (do you have the right lens with a large aperture but then you can't have zoom, etc.)It seems pretty fragile so I'm going to get some sort of case, especially since it's plastic and the case is not removable.  However, make sure you get a full case and not a case that just clips on the edges.  I made the mistake of buying one for my iPhone and sand/dirt got wedged in and ended up scratching the phone itself.  The Android OS is quite a bit different than iOS but I'm coping.  Can't say it's worst, just different.  The best part is the it being a Google phone will get updated for at least 3 years.  I have no big input on the exterior design of the outside, really all phones look the same - we have Apple to blame for that.  The fingerprint unlock is a huge plus and love it for all my iPads, computers.Very pleased so far (will update if that changes).  Since this phone is free to me, I plan to use my $100 Google store credit to buy another Pixel 3a for my wife.  She has a 2 year old Huawei Honor 8 that has held up pretty well, aside from every government in the world banning them.Update after 1 monthBest phone I've ever had.  Best camera I've ever had bar none, better than any Canon/Nikon DSLR I've had, etc.  I've take pictures from moving buses, etc. and each pictures looks like a million bucks...the first time.  I've used the camera for some professional portrait quality pictures.  Battery life is great.  I have had some data disconnection problems but not sure if it's a Sprint problem or otherwise but only happened a few times.  I'll monitor to see if it is a real issue.  I did end up buying a second 3a XL for spouse and she loves it too, still waiting for my google credit though...6 months updateHere is my update on both my wife and my experience after almost 1/2 a year.  So we both have Pixel 3a XL's.  Overall, they have been awesome.  Camera is awesome, no change.  For anyone who just wants to point and click, there is no equal for the price (same as all the media articles).  Battery life is great, no complaints.  Size is great, especially for reading for those of us who need bigger fonts.  So some issues.  I had an issue that took a long time to resolve where I was not getting notifications of new voicemails left (using Sprint).  Long story short after going to Sprint, working online with Google support, etc. the only way to fix it was to add an app called visual voicemail and sprint hub.  This is counter intuitive but it took a huge amount of effort and troubleshooting to resolve.  My wife, who had Best Buy setup the phone did not have any issue.  She does however have data connection lost issues that is resolved by restarting and I have had it also but not as often.  Essentially, the phone stops talking to the Internet.  I'm going to try to reset the phone to resolve and then will escalate to Google if it doesn't resolve.  Overall, still very pleased with the phones.",213

Along with that I'm holding the phone on it's side and I keep blocking the sound somehow so I move my hand and the sound sucks anyway because it just sucks in general. I never had another phone where the sound just gets blocked somehow when holding it on the side. Another thing it that the aspect ratio of the phone is weirdly long so the screen just looks weird to me. I'm not sure if I'm remembering this part correctly but the even the blue light filter sucked. It just goes from white to super yellow and no inbetween. Lastly this is probably just because I'm used to a large size phone instead of a regular one, but the text is so tiny. I went on reddit and was like holy is the text so small so I increased the text and then I could barely read any paragraphs because to make the text a reasonable size it took up so much space on the screen.I don't know if the camera is great or not I only tried it out in dim light.",18

5.0,"Pixel 3a best all around phone at the best price.
  
","December 9, 2019",Yes,"So much has been said about this phone, so I will try to boil it down. I have waited over three weeks before posting my thoughts.1. In December 2019 for $299 pre Black Friday limited time offer, no phone has a better camera and software combo. If you double the price, still can’t name a new phone at this writing that can beat it. Google just added the ability to photograph the stars like the pixel 4. This mode is automatic. The phone needs to be on a tripod or otherwise completely still for the long exposure mode be enabled.2. Less talked about, this particular version G020G US version has band 71 for TMOBILE, their new 600mhz band. This band will do more to make sure you get actual coverage rather than try to get you some high speed. Yes this phone supports all the major carriers, and having that rare (at this time) band 71 is nice.3. So other positives, Oled screen, always on display, be the first in line along with the essential phone to get bug fixes, security patches at the newest version of android.4. Headphone jack, let’s all say that one more time headphone jack.5. Dual speakers, one bottom firing the other is the ear piece.6. Stock android, no skin just the basics.7. Battery. Not in the pros or cons. It’s fine, not the crazy 14 hour heavy use champ, but it has never come up short for me.Some cons.1. Screen is that tall skinny aspect ratio. No my favorite. On the plus side easier to hold and reach all of the screen without issues.2. Because this budget budget phone is missing the dedicated image processing chip it takes longer to process images. You can still fire off as many as you feel the need to but to see the finished image, there will be a short wait. The lower the light level, the longer the wait. Not a deal breaker because the images are usually just so good.3. Screen is just a hair warmer than I’m used to. I have adjusted to it, but I mention it because you cannot adjust warmth.4. Speakers are on the weak side. Sound is even, good quality just not very loud.5. Notification sounds are too soft.6. Camera has no manual controls or any real controls. When the camera chooses the wrong white balance I cannot do anything really. Sometimes changing my aim slightly will cause the camera to choose something better but that doesn’t always work. Also a big pain. There is a big crop in video mode to aid stabilization so your field of view will get really tight. I don’t like this all all. It’s one of those things that isn’t mentioned often. I looked at lots of reviews both written and video and don’t recall any mentions.I’m sure I missed a lot, these are just some things that come to mind over the past few weeks.",10

I upgrade my smartphone every 8-12 months so I'm no stranger to using different phones, ranging from Google phones like the galaxy nexus, to the Nexus 6p as well as a Galaxy Note 3 and lately I've been on a good run of oneplus phones.My wife likes to hang onto her phones and also wants a smaller form factor. The pixel 3a is a welcomed entry in the smartphone world. Even though I've never used a Pixel 3 I have used a pixel 1 and 2,and I can say this 3a feels as fast as those phones. Sometimes specs aren't the while story. Regardless if this doesn't have top specs or a 4k display it feels premium, it feels fast, it looks great, and the camera is top notch.If you are on a budget this should be your choice. Nothing else comes close to the 3a's quality for $399. Pure Android is a treat if you've ever esperienced a horrible UI like LG's or Samsung, then you are missing out on pure Android. 3 years of support promised from Google is perfect as most people will replace their phone every 18-24 months but if you want to hold on just a little longer, Google has you covered.",11

","July 22, 2019",Yes,"On paper, the specs of this phone seem subpar. But honestly, it doesn't really matter because when you have this phone in your hands, it's extremely fast and responsive. I'm guessing this is due to some very well done optimizations on google's part.The camera is the best camera I've ever had in an android phone. The finger print reader works without error as long as my finger is dry. I tried to use the finger print reader after I got rained on for a bit, and that was the only time that it didn't work. In terms of battery life, If I leave location on, it does last me the whole day unless I'm using it quite heavily. However, I can make the battery last all day under heavy use if I simply turn off the location/GPS when I'm not using it.The little extra things about the phone are awesome as well: I love that there can be a song playing somewhere, and then I can turn my phone screen on and the song name will be there at the bottom of the lock screen.

So, if you connect it to your home, school, or work wifi and tell it to remember and always connect to that, it still won't. You have to manually reconnect each time. Many pixel users, including myself, are stuck with ""connected, no internet"" signal when the phone attempts to automatically connect. So instead of using WiFi, you're usually using your data.For example: You have it automatically connect to your work wifi when its in range. You leave work, go home, come back to work, and notice it says ""connected, no internet"" on your work wifi. You then have to reconnect to the wifi to get it to connect. Now, if you didn't notice, you would have been using your data!I'm not surprised.

But still, i tried to put that fact aside as i was testing my pixel.When it comes to cellphones I believe we weight certain features differently, in my case is pretty simple: all I really care about is the camera, computing power and battery life.I'm a hobbyist photographer and i own a full frame camera but carrying it everywhere is a hassle, so i find it really convenient to have a decent camera always with me. Night sight is definitely impressive! The photos are always crisp and this camera is really versatile, specially when taking low light pictures. The camera is simple to use, there's no way to change settings such as shutter speed or iso but that's not a big problem for me.The battery life is great! I normally charge my phone every 2 days but i must say that the processing power is not great, I've had a few cases where the phone ""freezes"" for a few seconds but not quite often so it's not a deal breaker for me.Overall i would give this phone a 4.5 rating but I'm definitely satisfied with the camera so I'll go for the 5 stars!",10

","June 30, 2019",Yes,"A lot of the budget smartphones have to sacrifice somewhere. Pretty much all of them will have sub-par cameras, decent at best displays, and of course loads of bloatware. This makes finding a nicely priced phone for my mother a bit of a challenge because she is always after the best camera with a nice display but couldn't care less about the specs. The Pixel 3a shakes things up by going against all other budget phones; it has identical camera quality to the flagship Pixel 3 (in other words, the gold standard) a full HD OLED display and absolutely no bloatware to find! Instead the Pixel 3a forgoes the flagship processor, and and what I like to call ""XL cupholder add-ons"" (features that no one would ever say no to, but aren't necessary in a phone), so no official IP rating, no wide angle selfie camera, no wireless charging or glass back, and only one of the stereo speakers is front facing. I myself would find myself gravitating more towards OnePlus phones where performance is prioritized over things like camera quality, but for my mother and most other people out there who just want a good camera and a beautiful display, there is no better phone!TL;DR best phone for anyone not absolutely obsessed with specs like me and uses their smartphone camera frequently (so 80% of the population)",8

Loved my Galaxy S3, wasn't impressed w/ S5, upgraded to S7 a couple years later and pretty much hated it (slow, glitchy) and decided I was done w/ Samsung, if possible (Galaxy's and iPhones are the most popular so I figured maybe I was SOL).  Did a lot of research via Cnet, Google reviews, Amazon reviews and determined the Pixel 3a seemed like it was just as good if not better than S10+ and for $500ish less.  I really like Google Home and figured a Google phone would have to work extremely well with Android.  Figured I'd give it a shot.  Verdict:  I LOVE MY PIXEL 3a!!!  It starts up super quick, not slow or glitchy, I love the fingerprint reader on the upper back of the phone (where you naturally hold it), very well-designed &amp; user friendly system, doesn't come loaded w/ a bunch of garbage apps you can't get rid of, you can squeeze the sides of the phone to open up google assistant, you can tilt the phone left and right to switch from front camera to back camera, the camera has so many features and the night sight is cool,  charges fast, batter lasts forever and I'm a heavy user.

","June 21, 2019",Yes,"My old Pixel1 died - or rather the battery did, and well you cannot replace it without spending ""half a phone"" on it.  I don't think any phone is worth $1000+ so I was happy that Google offered the 3a which has plenty of capacity for what I use my phone for for a reasonable price.  I went from having 15-30 minutes of phone time on a full charge to days.The process of copying data over failed because the old phone could not keep a charge long enough for the process to complete. With the help of Google support, I did a phone restore from the cloud instead, but this does not include _all_ data/apps. So the process of migrating from old to new phone, even within Google's own systems, was far from optimal and successful. Google support was very helpful of at least getting an operational phone with 85-90% of all features installed.You just need patience - every app have to be downloaded, you have to re-authorize/authenticate everything - and if you like me use apps for OTP, you'll have to create all new keys.Feature wise I like the XL size better then the original size. The ""press for google assistant"" sucks and will soon be disabled. I love the finger-print authentication, I used that a lot on Pixel1 too and it's still easy to use. Camera works, even thought he google app for taking photos is getting worse.The driving-mode feature sorta worked on the old Pixel, but it's like it has all new life on Pixel3a. The only problem is that it's over aggressive. Sitting on a plane I had to constantly turn it off as we taxied to take off (airplane mode does not disable GPS). But in my car it's GREAT - I start playing podcasts, set my destination and as I drive out the garage the drive-app activates and now incoming calls are ""restricted"" and full hands-free works great. The old pixel, this was all a manual process - and it would get confused at times and refuse to stop podcasts when calls came in.Given my experience with the pixel1 I'm unsure of the longevity of this phone. It has the same design fault not giving you access to the battery without a lot of special tools or spending quite a lot of money to have someone else do it. The next battery failure will be the last one for Pixel - at least for me.",5

Well, it has now been 3 months and a dozen or more interactions with Google's dysfunctional call center and I still haven't gotten a replacement phone, even though I am still paying them every month for it. Decided to switch to Cricket (ATT) and got a new G7 for free as part of the deal with no commitment.

One of the reasons for buying the 3A was the OLED screen. Made by Samsung. I wanted those inky blacks. And, this phone delivers that, but, the greys are very 'streaky'. That is when displaying a grey screen (which is often after Android 10 and black mode) there is a distinct dark vertical area to the right of the screen. It's very obvious, not just on low screen brightness. It's always been there, but in my early use of the phone I thought its was just an intentional gradient.It's not. The blacks are inky black, but the grays, even at high brightness, streak for about 1/4 of the right hand screen. It's VERY noticeable at low brightness.So, excellent phone in all other respects.

After coming from a Moto G6 and having a sizable amount of Amazon gift cards, I decided to splurge (for my budget, at least). I'm glad I made the purchase, and I think this will serve me well for at least 3 more years (I average about 2.5 years on my smartphones since 2010). Phone service and quality has been flawless so far for me on Google Fi.Pros:-The camera is excellent compared to what I've used before (Moto G6, Nexus 5, Galaxy S2, Galaxy S)-The battery life is very good for my needs and can easily last me all day on an overnight charge-Near-stock Android with top priority for new versions and updates-Excellent performance, but I don't play games on my phone-eSIM (was able to activate this without a physical SIM)-The fingerprint reader works great for me so far (compared to laptops I've used and my Moto G6)Cons or Potential Cons:-No wireless charging (this is mentioned in lots of reviews, not a surprise)-No face unlock option at the moment (I believed this was removed for not being very secure)-No notification LED (I miss this from my Nexus 5)-No micro SD slot (not a surprise, I don't think any Nexus or Pixel phones have had this)-There's no option to lock the screen with the fingerprint reader at the moment (I miss this from my Moto G6)-A bit expensive for my budget, but still a decent value for 2019If you liked Nexus phones or previous generations of Pixel phones, the Pixel 3a is a solid option in its price range.

I have been buying unlocked phones online for the last few purchases.I really like the Motorola/Lenovo line of unlocked mid-level hardware phones. The phones work well but the hardware was uninspiring.My last three unlocked phones were an Essential PH-1, Honor 7+ and a OnePlus 6T. Of those 3 it's hard to beat the 6T.  Hardware is premium and the phone works well. The Essential phone felt great but the camera was average. I dropped the phone a few times and although the screen never cracked (it was in a case) the digitizer stopped responding. So, this was my replacement option.I really like this phone. The camera is pretty amazing for a 300 dollar phone. I challenge anyone to show me a phone at this price point with a better camera experience. I will say that I've noticed a 'processing' message in the bottom left corner of the camera interface when taking pictures under less than ideal conditions. I can only assume that is the software processing the images through whatever algorithm the Google engineers have come up with to create such strong results from a single camera. I assume that the top line Pixel phones with their higher end processors will be a little quicker in performing this function. I haven't found it to be an issue though.Although this is the cheaper of the pixel line of phones, it actually feels pretty solid. I'll try to update the review with a couple of non personal photos soon.I find the battery life to be adequate. It's not the best but I feel like it's good enough.If you want a phone with a pure Android experience, solid financial value and an amazing camera experience, you would be hard pressed to find a better deal than the Pixel 3A.",3

The battery life is pretty good, I forgot to charge it one night and it didn't die until 6 pm the next day. The camera is great of course. That's about it. My phone had a serious overheating problem, and considering the fact that I only usually have 3-4 apps open (chrome, messanger, sms, camera) and am always inside, it was an aggravating feature to deal with. Whenever it over heated, it would immediately end whatever call/video call I was in the middle of, and wouldn't let me make a call back on the phone or on messanger (""Call failed""). Whenever you have to get used to saying ""Sorry, my phone..."" you've got a problem. Another annoying thing was watching videos...I would turn the screen for full screen, and the video would only cover half of the phone screen. I would download photos and not be able to find them in the photo files. I'd markup photos and not be able to find the marked up versions (they weren't in any albums).

My phone will take photos in lighting condition that my Canon T5 has no chance at all of resolving. Maybe leaving the T5's shutter open for a vast amount of time but impractical for most photography applications. The screen is nice and sharp with nice color and enough brightness for easy outdoor use as you would expect, and it goes low enough to use in the dark without being blinding. The speakers are exceptable not great, though is prefer both being front facing. Headphone jack including, thumbs up for that. Charging is quick and battery life for my uses get me though the day easily most days. Body of the phone is plastic and well made. I subscribe to the making a phone out of class being stupid camp and am happy this phone is my made from a more reasonable material. An added bonus being the phone is very lite so with a case on it it's less noticable in your pocket. This is a great device, and is everything the vast majority of people want and need in a smartphone for a great price. Lastly the phone will be supported and say up to date keeping your personal data more secure than other less diligent vendors.

","October 20, 2019",Yes,"Given all the problems I've faced with Google's phones the past couple of years, I was extremely reluctant to buy this one.  My Google phones have never lasted more than 2 years before issues arose.  With my Nexus 5x, I only had it a little over a year before it started shutting on/off at random times, a common complaint from other users.  When Google decided to switch phone manufacturers, I told myself, ""Maybe things will get better,"" but it turned out, only barely -- my Google Pixel only lasted a little over 2 years before the battery gave up.  I was able to get a refurbished one as a replacement under my Google store warranty, but it too exhibited battery drainage issues within 2-3 months.So why did I decide to get a Google Pixel 3a in spite of all these issues?  Well, first, I just couldn't find a better android than this one at this price point.  The camera, speed, and lack of bloatware -- it's just hard to give up luxuries such as these when you've been spoiled by pure android for so long.  Secondly, I liked Google Fi.  I barely use data since I'm always in a WiFi-connected building throughout the day, so Fi's pay-as-you-go data plan has helped me save a lot of money.  Family plans might be better at other places, but that wasn't a factor for me because I'm on an individual plan.  Third -- and this is why I ended up buying on Amazon rather than the Google Store or Best Buy -- Amazon was able to deliver this to me within one day!  I broke my phone on a Saturday night (trying to replace the battery with a DIY replacement kit I'd ordered online, if you must know), ordered this close Saturday night close to midnight, and found this on my door Sunday night at 7 pm.I am so grateful to Amazon for getting this to me before Monday morning!

The screen, when  bright, seems to suck a lot of juice, so it's always a balance to  be able to view, and also go easy on the battery.The camera is, as advertised, way out of the budget class.  I've compared low light pictures to phone/camera costing double and the 3a is clearly FAR superior.  The image processing is superior.The most lacking feature is that there is no optional external microSD slot.  Really?  That should be a requirement.  My guess is that since it's a Google phone, and since Google is cloud based, and since Google makes money by charging for cloud storage, well, you can see where that's going.  But this feature is something they REALLY should reconsider.  Not everyone wants everything in the cloud.  It was almost a deal breaker for me.  Heck, I use an offline GPS that has 6G of maps!  that's almost 10% of the available space.  Shame.Recommend buying this phone if you're interested in a mid-price phone with an excellent camera.  Doesn't replace a good SLR, but a whole lot handier to carry!",2

4.0,"Great Value for Money, Always Room to Improve
  
","January 2, 2020",Yes,"I bought this phone on Black Friday for $299 and so far I think it has been worth it. I was upgrading my two year old Motorola Z2 Play, so any comparisons are to that phone.Screen - The screen quality is excellent in my mind and the brightness is very goodCamera - Like most other reviewers, I agree the camera on this phone is absolutely wonderful. I'm currently in the process of re-taking a bunch of scenic pictures around Colorado that I've taken on previous phones because this one is so much better.Fingerprint Sensor - I do not like that it is on the back, as I often set my phone down on my desk and use it while working or otherwise playing on my computer. However, the speed and accuracy of the fingerprint sensor is noticeably better than my Z2 Play.Battery Life - While certainly in the ""good"" category, my Z2 Play was better in this area. I'm usually somewhere between 40-60% at the end of a typical day, my Z2 was closer to 60-70% most days.Call Quality - The call quality has been great. I was able to connect the unlocked phone to Verizon's Wifi calling with no issue.Headphone Jack - While this does have a headphone jack, it is on the top. After having it on the bottom on my last phone and the top before that, I prefer it on the bottom.Software - The performance is generally good for everything I've done on it. I'm not a gamer.Physical Form - This phone does feel nice in your hand, I do have a small case on it. It's just about the right size if you're mainly a one hand phone user. If you like to use two hands, it might be a tad small and you may want the XL version.Issues I've had (why I removed a star)1. The phone has restarted a few times without warning. I haven't ever actually noticed it, but it's come out of my pocket like it's starting up fresh 3 or so times in 6 weeks I've had it.2. I have trouble sending texts on some wifi networks (at my gym, for example). As soon as I disconnect form wifi, it works fine. I do not think this is a carrier/network issue because my old phone, using the same standard google messages app, did not have this problem. Hopefully the newly deployed RCS will make this a non-issue.For the record, my carrier is Verizon.",0

The camera of course is superb and unrivaled by any other phone brand out there.

My biggest gripe is that I didn’t pay attention and I thought this phone came with ability to add a memory card for addition storage. I guess I looked at too many and confused the Pixel with other phones. I would probably buy again, especially at the current price. I bought a few months early but had no choice.

Switching over from Samsung, the UI is similar with a minor drawback in that the home pages are not customizable; you will have to scroll to the right to get to the other pages while in Samsung you can rearrange them.One MAJOR drawback that I've seen since an update occurred, is that the base alarm clock no longer works. The clock app works fine but the alarm function is no longer works; as in, when the set time comes, the phone remains silent and the alarm simply switches off. Not cool.Another thing I miss since moving over from Galaxy is that the Google Photos app does seem to be somewhat lacking in the functionality department. The base Photos app in Samsung allows you to modify and create GIFs with your existing photos or videos, Google Photos does not.

","December 6, 2019",Yes,"This is probably good for most users but I discovered the narrow design rendered the keyboard nearly impossible to use. I also disliked the default launcher which presented previous pages in a lengthy band; I was constantly scrolling sideways. A  stacked format is much easier to navigate. This device appears optimized for someone who uses the device in one hand with thumb gestures. My small hand size, short thumbs and stiff joints are NOT amenable to this technique.I used this for 60 days and finally gave up! I never used the camera or phone or texting.

","September 23, 2019",Yes,"First of all to answer any concerns about this , the camera is great! Very high quality photos and pictures taken at night seems to be taken by a professional camera man in a studio . What is not good about the camera : Does not support manual mode .Mobile is fast can handle many tasks processor is great RAM is also working fine , it heats up a little (to a warm degree similar to holding a coffee cup using a collar ) after 3+ hours of continuous use but i am not judging this as a bad side .The package of the mobile itself is regular nothing too fancy it does contain however a groovy Google logo sticker (I didn't place it on the mobile though . The back side of the mobile feels so good to hold that i kinda miss it due to the protective case i am using .Selfie cam is awesome if i haven't mentioned that yet .The small things I don't like are basically some software issues that will hopefully be solved in the near future , for example most android mobiles has the ability to flip the phone while receiving a call to mute the ring tone ; that is missing ! .My old Asus phone had a cool feature which is the tap tap (knock knock as i liked to call) which is double tap on the screen unlocks the mobile or prompts you with the pattern . In the pixel 3a  one must either press the lock button or use the finger print sensor which is very efficient and have worked perfectly even if my finger was not exactly clean or a little bit wet .The phone however asks for patter reconfirmation a lot I don't know why ?Another thing would be if you are an individual concerned about your privacy this phone will protect your privacy from any app you want but google apps , using the google assistant to ask for directions to the airport would work fine but when you click on the map it came up with for the fastest route the phone will ask you for location service  permission , the phone consumes background data and uses any service in the mobile for google's favor without any permission what so ever but for other apps they are pretty careful about what YOU share .Definitely a good deal for the price and you are having a phone that looks like a high end product although it is a middle class phone and it also has a middle class price which shocks people about the great bargain you have ! ;)",0

After some use, it sat idle (still connected to WiFi) for about 4 days before it died all on the partial charge it had right out of the box.I like that the phone was not loaded with bloatware and just shipped with the basics.

I recharge about every four days when the battery level drops to about 20-30%. Now I can leave the house in the morning with 30% battery level and not having to worry about the phone dying. The camera is great. I like taking pictures of flowers and the blurring effect in the portrait mode is exactly what I need. Not having an SD card slot is a pity.

The highlight of the phone is the photos it can take and the overall user experience. This has to be the smartest smartphone I have used.It does everything so well and just blends in the background of your life. Squeeze for assistant, night sight, intelligent ram allocation, fingerprint scroll, now playing etc. make this phone appear smarter than most smartphones from even the top tier.I also like the fact that phone is so light in your hands and you can access the complete screen space using one finger.But, I do feel the phone is slightly less durable. The dragon trail glass used instead of gorilla looks and feel similar but seems a bit weaker. I dropped the phone on some sand and the glass on the right corner of the chin cracked. Usually, gorilla glass would deal with that kind of a fall without a crack.The battery life is great, recharges rapidly and lasts for a day's use - easy.

There was also no screen protector that you peel off when a phone is new... So this leads me to believe that it was a returned phone, which is a little concerning/ sketchy.

If you are an iPhone user I highly advise that you stick with your iPhone, it is a lot more secure and both front and rear cameras are the same quality. The Google pixel phone is not worth it.",1

","July 18, 2019",No,"I wish that Google had simply pumped up the specs for the 2013 Nexus 5 phone. It was perfect in so many ways, but notably, size. It fit in any pocket and was a great PHONE. The camera wasn't very good, but that was its one weak point.  I really miss that device. I moved to a Nexus 6 (Way too big) and then a Pixel XL in 2016. Great phone and also big, but lightning fast - even today. My daily driver is now a OnePlus 6T and it is also big. It has a nice bezel-less screen and loads app faster than I can call them up. But, after eight months of use, the battery no longer lasts all day like it did when new.All that is prelude to getting this new Google Pixel 3a - essentially the same phone as the Pixel 3, but in a more plasticy case and without the graphics processor to speed things up for the camera. Experts are proclaiming this phone to have a truely outstanding camera - state-of-the-art, no less. And it is good. But more about the shooter in a minute or two.The Pixel 3a - straight out of the box, is impressive. It is a smaller phone than many flagships out there, but I really like a phone that doesn't make me splay my fingers out when trying to do something one-handed with my phone. The display is very pleasant and the current version of the Android operating system is great. (My wife has an iPhone and occasionally asks for my help. I can't do half the stuff with IOS that I can do with Android, but I'm a bit biased.)The setup instructions are do-it-in-your-sleep simple, so if you hesitate upgrading because you've got a lot of stuff on your old phone, don't. The only hiccup I found was that one app on my eight month old OnePlus didn't transfer - it turns out that the app in question has been removed from the Google Play Store, so it wouldn't be moved to my new phone. What is curious to me is that most apps that get transferred to the new phone, using Google's transfer process, require you to log in with your username and password the first time you use them. OK, I get it. But, when I open up my saved wifi networks - some I haven't used in years - they're there and require no credentials. Not sure of the logic in this.The 64gb of internal storage is plenty for my needs - I generally don't store large video files on my phone nor have hundreds of apps. And, like the OnePlus, the phone is fast - apps load quickly.  The 3a battery lasts all day for me, but it's brand new. Check back with me in a year.The phone comes with an earphone jack, so I can use my old wired headsets again. The battery charges very quickly, too. I can run the phone down to under 20%, plug it in for 15-20 minutes and get the battery back up to 45-50% - enough to last the rest of my day.So, about that camera. Is it all that it is cracked up to be? Is it amazing?  Well, it is very good, but it surprised me that it isn't better than the camera on my OnePlus 6T. Now, to be honest, I did not use the night lighting feature. I'm sure it is nice, but I rarely, if ever, want to photograph things at night. If you do, then you might just adore the Pixel 3 camera. But to test out my observations, I took photos of a running fountain in my backyard on my original Pixel XL, my OnePlus 6T and the Pixel 3a. I looked at the resulting photos side-by-side on two identical monitors and judged them for color balance, hues and fine detail. In order of preference, the OnePlus came out first, then tne 3a, then the Pixel XL. The two pixel cameras had trouble with capturing the color of leaves and bark in the shaded portions of the photos. The OnePlus was more true to the colors in the actual scene and displaed more warmth. Details were slightly better on the two Pixel cameras, but not significantly better. Water droplets coming off the top tier of the fountain looked a bit more defined than on the OnePlus. This surprised me - Maybe I read too many critical reviews, but I thought that the OnePlus camera was one of its weaknesses - it isn't at all.In summary, the Pixel 3a is a fabulous phone. It comes in a convenient size and is backed up by two years of updates. The camera is very good and will reward you with very accurate photos. The software is quick like a bunny and transferring your old phone's applications to this one will be simple. You will like this phone a lot - and for about $400, it is a steal.",13
1.0,"Microphone Didn't Work on Brand New Phone
  
","June 5, 2019",No,"I own 3 Google Mini's, a Google Home, and a Chrome-cast, and had just signed up for Google-Fi, so I figured it was time to have a Google phone.It arrived 6/3 and the microphone stopped working 6/4 and am having it refunded on 6/5.I got called from a potential employer twice and they couldn't hear me. They wasted 7 hours of my time.Purchased from the Google store.I had 6 interactions where Google couldn't identify the problem before saying it'd take 2-7 days to ship a replacement.I asked if they could simply overnight it, or give me a two year warranty, or literally anything since they are selling faulty phones. Long story short, it's their 3rd generation of phones and they still can't get it right, and they don't even want to try. I've been Google loyal for 7 years and after they delivered a faulty phone and didn't want to make it right, I'm switching to Apple.",16

3.0,"Good deal for Android fans
  
","July 14, 2019",No,"I really wanted to like the Pixel 3a - it's camera is amazing and truly unique at this price point, but you already knew that. Every reviewer is raving about it, battery life is adequate, screen is amazing and overall experience is quite pleasant. To me, coming from an iPhone 7, it's not much of an upgrade - I can get by with an older camera and LCD display, battery life is on par or better with standby. If you are asking yourself if you want/need this phone then that's the real question. Battery life is decent for Android, which isn't saying much and isn't really a selling point as others have mentioned - this is the phone the Pixel 3 should have been, but with better build quality. And if we're being honest, build quality does factor in, there is nothing sexy about this phone and isn't even understated enough to be charming, it's just bland. I'm not a power user, and will admit I much prefer IOS in favor of stable apps, great standby battery life/optimization, Siri belonging on the short bus, and GASP - iMessage. I applaud Google for such a great effort to bring back the cheap smart phone, I just wish it either tried harder to beat Apple or go their own way, but like most things Google, the end product is merely half baked.",9
5.0,"Very nice phone, but needs a better pricing plan
  
","June 6, 2019",No,"This is a very nice phone with lots of features.  Most notable is the quality camera that is used and the flat screen rather than the curved screen on Samsung phones.  Also notable is that you are getting pure android and not someone's proprietary apps and bloat.  One negative is that it is not the latest greatest processor but rather a upper middle of the road one.  The other negatives is the high price to get it unlocked if not activating with a carrier.  Why should it cost a hundred dollars more without activation, especially when several places were offering pre-sale gift cards worth 100 dollars.  I put the item in my cart which included a 100 Amazon gift card, but when I went to purchase it indicated that the gift-card offer was no longer available.  If they sold this for $379 it would be well worth the money but no way is it a $479 (almost 500 phone).",6

This phone is retailed at 399.99 compared to the Samsung 10plus for a whooping 1000+ to me that is insane. This phone is so easy to use and it is completely customizable to your liking! The camera on google pixel 3a is INCREDIBLE it captures realism and the color is amazing!!! For being such a cheaper phone it does amazingly well compared to the big name companies out there (Apple and Samsung). I remember when phones where under 500 and now it's double that!

4.0,"Decent phone but not outstanding
  
","August 9, 2019",No,"I bought my pixel 3a at a T-Mobile store, a d not on Amazon. I have had it now a few months, and think that I can now give a good opinion of how I feel about it. The sound quality is just decent. The speakers are not as loud as people make them sound to be. The fingerprint reader is decent. I'm coming from an honor 6X, which has just as fast a fingerprint reader as the 3a does. The quality of the screen is good. You can see it in sunlight, but it's not very clear. The battery life is just average. I don't play games on my phone, and compared to my honor 6X which I could go a full day, almost a day-and-a-half I barely get three-quarters of a day with the 3A.

I took it with me on my trips, took some pictures and people thought that my pictures were taken with a professional camera!! Also the phone charges super fast thanks to the 18 watt charger. This phones is not water resistant but how many times are you going to drop your phone in water?? It does not have wireless charging which is no biggie for me because you usually have to buy the wireless chargers separately anyway. And it does have a plastic body which I don't mind because I will be using a phone cover anyway. All I can say is that my money was well spent and the phone is very good for the money I paid  hopefully Google will continue to release these budget versions of their phones in the future!",5

Had an interesting time transferring photos from my PC to this phone.  I found that if I copied into an empty folder on the phone, it worked fine.  If it ever gave me a message about skip or replace, regardless of the answer when it was done ""copying"" no new files were on the phone.  Google assistant was not as easy as it should have been to disable and then the phone kept asking me to re-enable it.  So I got rid of Pixel menu and Google assistant and went back to Evie.  The hardware volume control is worthless as it only adjusts one of the volumes.  For some reason the notification volume is linked to the ringer volume so I had to install a 3rd party app to separate those.  The built in ringtones were too quiet for me so I downloaded a really loud one from Zedge.  I love the built in call screener.  Have not had much to do with the camera yet, they say its really good.  I would rather the fingerprint scanner be on the front.  Will write more later.  Update 7/17 I like the phone.  The speaker phone fidelity is terrible.  Still haven't done much with the camera. (My previous POS phone got me out of the habit of taking pics). That's the only negative (the fidelity). All in all, I'll get another one of these for the wife.  Update 7/28 the only two problems, one small one large.  Small: whenever you adjust the ringer volume it has to play a sample.  I turn the ringer volume down when I go to bed. Would like to turn it up when I awake but can't because it blasts out 3 seconds of the loud ringer and Don't want to wake others.  Would like to be able to adjust the ringer slide without audio confirmation.  Second problem, big, people that I call have trouble understanding me and me them.",3

I judge paying more than a few hundred dollars for a phone to be daft. So wrong about that, I know now.I had the chance to get the pixel 3a xl. What a difference it makes. The camera feels like it is about 3 decades of technology better. The night sight is great, but the overall clarity of the picture is far superior.The screen size and quality is also infinitely better. I like the size of it too, as I have big hands. But watching a movie on the phone is generally a better experience.Also, the finger print reader is so easy to use and versatile, I find I can use it with different functions and it is very sensitive.I have been footering about with this edge sense thingy and can't quite work out why I need that. But this is new to me so perhaps i will get used to it. Right now, using it to active google voice search isnt something i do a lot of.I'm not sure if I will ever need 64gb of memory but I see it is not expandable. Personally I do not see that as an issue because I don't need that many apps, and it is a Google phone so you get access to online storage.Really though, the point of this is that I have noticed a vast difference in quality that I feel justifies the difference in the price.Update**I'm loving this battery. It charges really fast and drains very slowly. Well played Google!Also, I found this function where the phone picks up music playing nearby and tells you what song it is.

","July 12, 2019",No,"Being an unlocked Pixel phone, purchased from Google (assuming you purchase from Google and not Verizon, etc.), you will have timely security updates pushed OTA. Unfortunately, other manufacturers prioritize wacky UI customizations over keeping their phone builds maintainable and providing timely security updates. Right now Google is guaranteeing updates until May 2022.Battery life on this Pixel 3a is just as good as my Pixel 3: *excellent.* I use my phone through throughout the day for sending emails, finding answers to life's most important questions during work meetings, getting distracted on social media. At the end of each day, it's not uncommon that I read an ebook, search for a new project on Pinterest/Ravelry/whatever, or scroll through my Instagram for a few hours. I've not yet managed to trigger a low battery warning on the 3a (partially because I haven't had it as long) and only triggered it a couple of times on my Pixel 3. I haven't compared the actual capacities of the two, but just from use, they seem to be at least similar in their greatness. With this phone, you can successfully bombard your eyeballs with too many hours digital pixels every day!The 3a is noticeably lighter than the Pixel 3. If you prefer a lighter phone, this might be a big deal to you. Again, I haven't paid attention to the spec sheet, just to what I can observe through casual (unscientific) use.The 3a is a decent amount cheaper. So if you're on somewhat of a budget, this may be a factor for you. Sure, this isn't a ultra cheap phone, but in comparison to your other Pixel options, the price is good and comparable to the Nexus of the good olde days.The 3a has a flatter screen than the 3. If you've cursed at finding a screen protector that doesn't peel at the edges (or stop 1/4"" short of the edges to avoid peeling) this is a big deal. My Pixel 2 managed to get a light scratch in the screen while sitting on my desk during the first hour I owed it--I could have sworn nothing even toughed it! I just don't skip screen protectors anymore, especially with an $800 (at least at the time I got a 3) device.The 3a has a headphone jack (at the cost of water resistance).I have no problems with phone calls, but then I use Google Fi, so switching phones is a seamless experience. I just logged into the new phone (esim) and everything comes back. Your experience of course may vary if you're moving Apple--&gt;Android, using a different carrier, don't back up your settings to Google, etc.Overall, if the 3a had been available at the time the 3 was released, I would have purchased it instead. I may have had some worry that maybe I was missing out on something (there are a few feature differences--the dual-selfie cam to zoom out, if you're into selfies, and water resistance--comes to mind). But overall, this does not disappoint.It more than fills the void that has been missing since Google moved from Nexus to Pixel.",2

Over the years with subsidies, we've programmed ourselves to always get the most expensive flagship phones and just pay them off as part of a contract or in monthly payments, but unless you are one of the very few high-intensity gamers, you really didn't need most of those phones.  A phone like the 3a, has more than enough processing power for all everyday tasks and a bit more.  The camera is of course hard to beat shy of $1,000 now, the screen is very nice, and the battery life is a bit above average (better than the Pixel 2).  You will get updates first, and Google has a Pixel support line, much like Apple, if you need support.If I had any complaints?  Hmmm... maybe make the speakers just a LITTLE louder when it comes to voice speaker calls.  It's fine in other areas, but for some reason falls shorter when on a speaker phone call - so up that a bit.  But give it a try.

Also the Samsung galaxy S10+'s rear camera is equipped with a 12mp lens, the Google Pixel 3a XL rear camera is equipped with a 12.2mp lens. The Google Pixel fares slightly higher, but the Galaxy S10 plus has some very impressive technology at your disposal with 3 rear lenses and 2 front with camera and built-in advise to give you the very best shot possible. So who wins? Technology wise, the S10 Plus by far. But for the pixel having only a single lens to do it all? I'd have to hand it to the pixel overall.

3.0,"Ok, But Very Different Than What You're Used To
  
","December 19, 2019",No,"Ive had this phone for several days and so far I'm pretty underwhelmed with it. I've had many other phones in the past ranging from several Samsung's, LG, HTC, Motorola, Nokia, etc. I also own tablets, an iPad, and a Mac. The 3a is the first phone in roughly ten years that has made me miss the usability of my old phone. So far here's my take:PROs:Camera - is very good, although zooming is harder than on other phones I've used. The night sight option is excellent, wish all phones had this. Great resolution.Speed - is excellent, no issues loading websites, tasks, or streaming video (but of course nearly any new phone would be doing this)Processor Specs - this phone is pretty fast and should be up to date for a long time, possibly faster &amp; better than other phones in or under it's price range.Form and Fit - fits nicely in hand with lots of cases availableFingerprint Reader - works nearly everytime and better than my last phoneGoogle Assistant - haven't used it much but supposed to be awesome. Perhaps not a big deal as any Android phone can access Hello Google etc and then you ask it a question like the weather or traffic. I realize the Google Assistant does a few other things but I don't see this as deal breaker to own the phone over. Nice to have though.CONs:Overall usability - UI (user interface)  is far behind other manufacturers in my opinion. This is like Google's version of the iPhone, you can't customize the home screen very much, you CANNOT control icon size on your home screen nor decide if you want rows of 4 icons. You are locked into 5 tiny icons on your home screen in each row (I checked with Google and you cannot change this!). I have found this adds lots of eye fatigue whereas this can be customized to your heart's content on Samsung, LG, etcSearch Bar - it's permanently mounted on the Bottom of Home screen whether you like it or not. You can't move or remove it. Which is odd because this is where ALL other phone companies put your icons for Calling, Texting, Contacts, etc. Get used to seeing the Google search bar there (and for Google Assistant), obviously Google wants to push this design on you.Pure Android experience - Maybe, but it's Google's rules. Very very different in settings and other features in the Android build. You can customize some stuff, other important stuff like icon size and moving the dumb search bar from the homescreen you are stuck with.On/Off buttons - Are crammed right next to the volume, I'm constantly shutting off the screen when I just want to raise volume, bad design.Battery Life - Just average, was expecting more. My last phone by LG had the battery life beat by a mile compared to the Pixel 3a. Isn't battery technology better? Odd the Pixel will drain a brand new battery with very light use in 24 hours.Tray Notifications - at top of screen and absolutely TINY. Can't customize this as far as I know. Can barely see the notifications for gmail, YouTube, Calendar. It's just not that friendly. Much less user friendly than the last two phones I've owned.No SD Card for upgrading - that means you'll rely on Google to backup all your photos &amp; videos. Is it just me or am I the only person that doesn't want Google having every single photo I ever take on their servers? If you use your phone to take videos and want to edit them, lack of an SD card makes it much harder to move that video to your computer for editing.Gmail App - Not as nice looking as the ones on my last phones, a little harder to switch accounts. Much preferred the one in my Samsung and LG.Conclusion: This is a great fast phone with awesome camera. but it has serious limitations. If it wasn't for the camera I'd replace it tomorrow with something else. The homescreen is a real drag not being able to enlarge icons or have them 4 to a row instead of the required 5.  I realize you can install 3rd party launchers to do this for you, but why have to do that on a new cutting edge phone? I mean it's really a bummer and the biggest issue I'm having. Plus, in a couple years if the phone slows down, the launcher may need to be uninstalled to free-up resources.This might be the phone for you if you don't mind being locked into Google's Sandbox, but I would say wherever you buy it make sure there is a return policy in case it's not for you.

We did a month-long trip overseas and in the states, I never had an issue with getting the phone to connect and keeping the signal.Folks are fussing over the lack of wireless charging, waterproofing, the build and storage (64GB). Honestly, none of those were issues for me, wireless charging is nice but, eh.The waterproof thing, again not a big issue, have yet to drop a phone in water, wine, toilet, lake, ocean, pond or puddle yet.Storage is 64GB onboard, then add in unlimited space from Google and it really becomes a non-issue.As for the build (plastic rather than glass on the back), it feels just fine to me. As I keep mine in a case anyway. Glass on the back just one more thing to break if dropped.Now my Cons:Speaker, I wish it were a bit louder, it is not anemic by any account, but a bit more umphf would be nice.NFC and connectivity with iOS devices. Not the phone's issue per se, but it would be nice to be able to share pics, and such with Apple devices like iPhones or iPads.Connecting to a Mac, again more an Android issue, but you have to jump through fiery hoops to get anything to or from this phone and a Mac.I may be a glass half full kinda guy, but this is a really nice phone when you compare the features to the price.

Almost identical to my Wife's Pixel 3 XL ..the expensive one.  I haven't had any phone call issues , works really well over my Toyota's console for phone calls as well. Took a few pictures, and took me a time or two to figure out why my ""picture"" was moving, not a video. Seems there is a feather that captures the motion when you snap it, but an easy button to turn it off for the shot.  Highly Recommend.",3

2.0,"Fragile, poorly designed fase and case makes for a crack-prone phone, repair process is terrible.
  
","October 18, 2019",No,"This phone is SO DELICATE - the face will crack if you look at it the wrong way, no dropping even necessary.  The glass screen seems to ""flex"" around the plastic case, and I have had two hairline fractures in my display within less than 6 months of owning the phone (the second occurred just days after I got the first one repaired, from being in my handbag, not dropped).  Also when the screen cracked the first time, the phone stopped working altogether -- usually you can still operate the phone with a crack, but not this phone.  WORST is the repair process -- you have to FedEx your phone to Google, which will repair and send it back to you in 7-10 days!  You can only have the phone repaired in-store if you live near the handful of stores authorized to repair the pixel.  I live in San Francisco, and the nearest store is an hour drive away (and I don't have a car).  Finally, you cannot TALK to anyone on the phone about your repair - they send you an email saying what it will cost to fix it.  I wanted to contest the $140 repair cost because I see this crack as being a product design defect -- not may fault -- and I don't think I should have to pay for it.  After about 30 minutes talking and waiting for a customer service rep to help me, his only response it that they can't do anything to modify the repair work authorization to reduce or waive the repair fee on the phone, you can only communicate via email (which is limited to, accept or reject the repair charge).The battery is also not good, barely lasted a day with normal usage (and I am a light user - I don't stream video or music much at all, and mostly use my phone for texting, email, and playing stored music, not streaming).In short -- the cost savings for this phone are NOT worth it.  I have never experienced a cell phone that cracked so easily in my entire life, and that is so arduous to repair.  The first repair took the full 10 days -- so I had to use an old, barely functioning phone during that one.  I'm still waiting for the current repair ORDER to process and I sent it to google 4 days ago!  I hate being captured by Apple, but the iphones I've had over the past decade proved way superior in terms of durability and repairability.",2

The screen shattered and apparently there was also internal damage.  I spent a lot of time on the phone with their cs rep assuring me only the repair of the screen would need to be paid for.  Their repair shop YOUBREAKITIFIX advised me otherwise, and I was told the phone has a glass screen and not gorilla glass. He would be responsible for the entire repair cost.  Google does NOT stand behind their product unless, you purchase their additional warranty. It's a cheaply made phone and has no quality.

","December 6, 2019",No,"Like many other reviewers, I can confirm that this would be an excellent device for almost any user. I am myself a demanding user :). An audiophile. The on-board audio codecs and overall capability of the device to work with DACs matter to me more than the quality of the camera or the accuracy of the fingerprint sensor. And yet - the Pixel 3a XL excels at all these! The camera makes wonderful pictures and keeps the size manageable (3-4 MB per picture). The battery is solid. The screen is bright and clear. The colors are rich. And the audio is really good. The quality of the calls is excellent, the call volume is loud enough. The phone also happens to be among the few models that have the Qualcomm aptX HD Bluetooth codec which allows great music listening experience with wireless headphones (at hi-res depth that exceeds CD quality). No Samsung or Apple phones come equipped with the aptX HD codec (a few Asus, Motorola, and LG models do).A few minor cons:- No micro SD card slot. The phone, though, works with an external card reader well (make sure the the micro SD card which you put in the reader is formatted first to FAT32).-When making portrait pictures, the phone saves two copies of each picture and you have to use third party software or log into Google Photos to remove manually the redundant copies.-The phone is not waterproofI've been using it happily for the past few weeks and I am very, very pleased with my purchase.

So I called Google to have the screen repaired and explained it wasn't a Warranty Claim. They said they couldn't do a repair and referred me to an outfit in England who would. So I called England. They said they couldn't repair it either because the phone couldn't be repaired at all. Naturally, I asked why. Well, Google made the dumbest engineering mistake in the history of telephones. All of the phone's electronics are embedded in the glass screen. So if you damage the screen, you now own a handsome door stop. So if the 3A is built the same way (and I believe it is) just be certain you ask if it's built like the Pixel 3. If it is, be aware you can never drop or damage it in any way.",1

","August 12, 2019",No,"I love my Pixel 3a. Have been using Android phones since 2012. I have tested an reviewed hundreds of phones. My most recent phone was a Nexus 5x. Positives: #1 Excellent Camera: The photos come out great every time. The double tap power loads quickly and I'm able to get the camera running in time to catch good photos and videos of my kids. It is much faster to load then my Nexus 5x and the pictures are slightly better overall, which is amazing to me as the 5x takes great photos too. I love the Portrait mode photos I've taken. People are amazed and think they were taken on a DSLR camera. Night sight is amazing too, it works really well especially outdoors in the night or in poorly lit rooms. Video is good. The stabilization mode works pretty well. I love the Slow motion with audio and the Time Lapse modes as well. Both work great with kids. My wife was so impressed with the photos and performance of the phone she got one too. #2 Battery: Excellent all Day battery life. I have never seen the battery get below 30% using it all day from 6am to 11pm. Today, I have been using it all day off and on and it's midnight and it's still at 51%. My wife also is very impressed with the battery life. #3 Performance: It's Fast The phone is very fast, it doesn't lag or studder. The only time there is a slight delay in processing is with Night Sight photos. But otherwise it's smooth and quick. I tend to have 10 apps open at one time and quickly switch back and forth between different apps. I will have maps, gmail, calendar, chrome open, with music playing and will quickly switch back and forth between apps without any lag. #4: Size: It feels like a fairly compact phone! I was really concerned that the phone was going to feel huge coming from a Nexus 5x with a 5.1 screen. Because they are using the slim design that Samsung has been using on their S8, S9 and S10 phones it feels surprisingly thin. My Nexus 5x actually feels a little bulky now because it is wider. My wife came from a 4.7 Idol 3 phone and was surprised with how small the phone felt. It's also very light but still feels and looks like the more premium Pixel 3. #5 Support: 3 years of Updates We both love that the phone will continue to get monthly software/security patches and updates for 3 years. No other Android phone can hold a candle to this! Negatives: Only wish we would have bought two of these with the $100 gift card. Otherwise, there are literally no negatives I can think of so far. I'm a very picky person and literally bought and returned 7 laptops on Amazon, Best-Buy &amp; WalMart during the same 2 months I have had my Pixel 3a, because weren't exactly right. I love and would highly recommend the Pixel 3a. I hope that Google makes a 4a and a 5a, if they keep this price/quality point I will be a loyal Google customer for years to come. Overall we (my wife and I) both love the phone and have had no regrets at all with our purchase. I bought mine for $300 on a promotion in May from B&amp;H with 3 months of Mint Mobile Free. But we were fine to pay the full $399 for my wife's phone. Best tech purchase we have made in years.",1

The average user won't really notice a difference between the pixel 3a or a flagship phone. At lest not when browsing switching apps or using social media.Battery life of the 3a is great. I get approximately 7 - 7,5 hours of screen on time. Watching YouTube, Facebook, browsing, etc. I'm not huge into gaming so I don't know if that effect s the battery much more.

5.0,"A segment killer. Hands down, the best full-featured smartphone you can get in its price range.
  
","June 27, 2019",No,"OK, this is gonna be the easiest phone review I've ever written:With the Pixel 3a, Google has redefined the mid-line smartphone. While there are somewhat better phones available for much more money, and worse phones available considerably cheaper, this is a smartphone that will satisfy the vast majority of users, available at about 2/3 to 1/2 the price of anything even remotely worth considering as an upgrade.Usually I save the punchline for the end, after a long look at features and quality. But in this case, I wanted to lead with conclusion, because it's just so obvious.There have been about a billion articles written that list the basic specs of this phone, so I'm not going to repeat those here. But I will summarize just what makes this phone so appealing.I have also attached some photos to put a point on some of my comments. In particular see the comparisons of how the camera on this phone does in difficult low light ""dusk"" conditions. It blows away the comparison cameras on phones like the iPhone 8 and Motorola's previous flagship the Z2 Force. (And new flagships aren't that much better).Let me start by saying that what people want in a smartphone, no matter what nonsense the hardware manufacturers are trying to sell, are the following:A) Good phone receptionB) Full support of the major carriersC) Fluid experience (apps open quickly, run properly, no unnecessary heavy OS tweaks or bloatware)D) Sufficient integrated flash storageE) A good cameraF) A screen that's ""big enough"" and that looks goodThat's it. Sure, there are niceties like a fingerprint reader, waterproofing, memory expansion, and whatever they're hyping this year, but if you meet A-F, you have phone you'll be happy to use.The Pixel 3a meets all of the A-F criteria. In a head-to-head with a thousand dollar iPhone or Samsung phone would it win? No. But as Voltaire said ""don't let the best be the enemy of the good."" Especially if that money is coming out of your pocket.Running down the specifics:A) Phone Reception. The Pixel 3a gets good phone reception. In the era of Smartphones, that often gets overlooked. I've had expensive feature-laden smartphones that could barely maintain a signal once you left good signal areas. The Pixel holds its own. Is it as good as my Motorola Z2 Force (Motorola is known for particularly good reception)? No, not quite. But the difference is small enough to not worry about.B) Full support of the major carriers. One thing that's really nice about the Pixel 3a is that it works PROPERLY with all the carriers. A lot of ""unlocked"" phones will work with the various carriers, but will fail to set up properly to run the proprietary apps that belong to the carrier. For example, I have had numerous unlocked phones that did not correctly set up with a T-Mobile SIM (my carrier) to support their voLTE (phone+data) or voice messaging services. The Pixel 3a just...works...Put in your carrier's SIM card and it sets up the necessary functionality for your carrier (at least in the USA).C) Fluid Experience. Yup, it's plenty fluid. A lot of people have bemoaned that this phone is based on the Snapdragon 670 processor, rather than the Snapdragon 8x5 series processors found in flagship phones like the big brother Pixel, the Samsung S10 and so on. But a lot of that is ignorant processor envy. The reality is that in day-to-day operation, the 670 offers performance that would be difficult to differentiate from the 8x5 series. Sure, if you run synthetic benchmarks, the 8x5 looks better. But if you are the typical user who uses your Smartphone for email, surfing, maps and the occasional game, you are not going to know the difference--especially since Google has done an outstanding job of tuning the Android backend to maximize performance with the 670.D) Sufficient integrated storage. Yup. You get 64Gb of storage. That's not enough to set the world on fire these days (flagships mostly start at 128Gb). But it's enough to store just about everything and anything you should be storing on your phone. If you are the kind of person whose phone is running out of space because of too many pictures and videos, look into Google Photos, where you can upload your photos for free and get them off your phone.E) A good camera. Yes!!!! Not only a good camera, but within a hair's breath of the very best camera you can get on a smartphone. The very best camera award currently belongs to the big brother Pixel 3, which has a second lens for some special effects, and a Pixel Visual Core co-processor which means that photos process a little more quickly. But in terms of just quality, the Pixel 3a has as good a camera as ANYONE, and a MUCH better camera than most, including the flagships from brands not named Samsung or iPhone. It's also arguably better than their flagship cameras, although it's not worth going down that rabbit hole right now. What makes it so good? OIS (optical image stabilization) that really works. Accurate colors. Low light performance (in something Google calls ""NightSight mode"") that is nothing short of amazing. (See the pictures I've attached for proof). This is the first time in smartphone history that a camera that could legitimately be called best appears on a mid-line smartphone. That's amazing.F) Big enough screen. Good enough screen. I'll start with good enough. The screen is bright and readable even in sunlight. It has 2220x1080 resolution, which is not the best of any smartphone, but it's very good, especially given the moderate screen size of 5.6"". No one who isn't into specs or very very niche apps will be unhappy with the resolution. Is it big enough? Well, that's gonna come down to taste. What I can say is that this is a perfect size for one-handed operation. If you are one of a very large number of people who bemoan the days when you could actually operate your smartphone with one hand, the size of this phone is probably your sweet spot--at least of the currently supported sizes among leading Android manufacturers. If, on the other hand, you're a more-is-more person who wants as much on the screen as possible, then you may be better suited to the Pixel 3a XL (exact same as this phone, except a bigger 6.0"" screen), or the Pixel 3 XL (6.3"") or maybe one of those ""what the heck is that tablet you have on your ear"" things from Samsung. But for the vast majority of people, the size of this phone is going to be quite satisfactory.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------So this phone hits all the important high points. But, wait, there's more:A fingerprint reader (located in the center of the back) that is very responsive and accurate.A headphone jack (!!!) Yes! They brought the headphone jack. Why they ever got rid of it is a mystery of ""hey Apple did it maybe we should too"" proportions. Since 3a seems to be the ""people's Pixel"" it makes sense they'd bring back the jack. That means you can use your old wired headphones, if you didn't already shift to Bluetooth. And if you shifted to Bluetooth, this phone can work with those, too. Options...what a concept.4Gb RAM. One way a lot of phone manufacturers cheap out on their mid and low line phones is by providing less than 4Gb of RAM. 4Gb RAM is the sweet spot for Android. You don't really need any more. But if you have less, you can find your phone bogged down when you have multiple apps open. So it's nice that the Pixel 3a has a flagship-worthy 4Gb.The battery is 3000 mAh, which a few years ago would have been jaw-droppingly great, but is 15-25% less than some of today's flagships. That said, because the screen is smaller and the 670 processor is less power hungry, you actually get good life out of that battery. I am pretty hard on my phone, and tend to get a day out of a full charge, although by the end of the day I'm in that stressful &lt; 20% range. I did a power consumption when just sitting around test, shown in the pictures. I got about 64 hours of use out of it in that case before it hit 10% and went into deep battery saving mode. That's not bad at all.Supports fast charging. I was able to fully charge the battery from 10% back to 100% in a little over 1.5 hours of fast charging. If you just need a top off, you can get a double digit increase in the charge with just 15 minutes. (The last bit of charge to 100% is always the hardest/slowest).Little niceties like squeezing the sides of the phone to open Google Assistant, and double tapping the screen to unlock it.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------OK, so at this point you may be wondering what are the downsides of this phone? You've got a grand burning a hole in your pocket? Can't I provide some reasons to waste it on a double priced flagship?Well, here are the downsides:This Pixel 3a does not support wireless charging. This is a drag. I love wireless charging: I set my phone on a wireless charging stand next to the bed and in the morning it's fully charged. I'm sad they didn't include wireless charging here.The Pixel 3a is not waterproof or certified water resistant. If you are the type of person prone to dropping their phone in the toilet or the pool, this may not be the phone for you. I am not that kind of person, so that's OK with me.There's no memory expansion. You get your 64Gb and that's it. There's no memory slot to expand the memory. I don't think this is a deal killer unless you keep your entire song library or movie collection on your phone. But it's worth noting.The phone is made of plastic. It looks pretty, but it's plastic. Upside: It won't break like a glass case. Downside: It's plastic. Somewhere, sea life just shed a tear. But once you put a case on it (and who doesn't use a case?) what difference does it make? It's like all the nonsense about whose phone is 0.001 mm thinner. Who cares? The case makes that irrelevant.The phone has only 1 front facing speaker. That means mono. But before you boo-hoo, when is the last time you got the sense of great stereo separation from your flagship phone with stereo speakers? Maybe never? The speaker on the 3a is plenty loud and to me that's far more important than whether I might every be able to hear a stereo signal from it's (like all other smartphones) tinny speaker.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------To summarize, there is a lot to like, some to love, and precious little to bemoan about the Pixel 3a (for me, probably the biggest moan point is the lack of wireless charging). A phone like this would have been a flagship a few years ago. Now it is within shouting distance of the relevant feature set of this year's flagships. And it has a better camera than almost all of them.If you really want to save money, and you're willing to give up important features and experience, then you should look at the low end Motorola phones, which offer real value in that segment. If you have double the money the Pixel 3a costs and you just have a burning desire to throw sense out the window (or you really have to have a bigger screen), then look at Pixel 3 or the Samsung flagships or (if you must) the iPhone flagships.For everyone else, the Pixel 3a is where it's at.",46

3.0,"I really wanted to like this phone...
  
","July 28, 2019",Yes,"I had always wanted to buy a pixel ever since the first one was released. but they had always been on the high side of the cost spectrum. When Google announced 3a, I said to myself finally! I saved up and got the phone. My first impression of the phone was ""WOW! I love it!"". Aesthetically, the phone looks absolutely stunning.I am one of those people who doesn't put his stuff into the cloud, so I had to sit down for four hours to move my data, contacts etc. over to the phone. This is when I started noticing some differences. Understandably, the phone was different to the touch. A very common observation when moving from one manufacturer to another. I thought, oh no problem, let's adjust the screen sensitivity and surprise! It is an add on feature, not present in vanilla android. Oh well, its just one thing. After that I ran into issues while setting a custom ringtone. Turns out that you have to move the file to a specific folder and restart the phone and it goes on.. I ran into a few such 'issues' but I thought that it was probably just the transition to the new phone. Camera on the phone by the way is phenomenal!Anyway, a few days later I started noticing how I am missing calls. The phone is next to me but it doesn't ring. I made sure all the do not disturb stuff is off, made sure the volume is max. I even changed by ringtone! For some reason, my own ringtone sounded really low on the phone. I went to one the pixel sounds, but still had issues getting calls. This is when I started thinking that perhaps I should return this phone, but I still persisted partly because I liked it overall, and partly because I didn't want to transfer data again. The final straw came a few days ago when I missed a very important call from my wife's doctor. That day we both sat down and she called my phone. To our surprise, the phone didn't ring. Her phone showed that it was ringing. Right after I unlocked it, I got a missed call! Pixel forums online had tons of such reports. Honestly, if a phone can't fulfill its main purpose of being able to receive a call without issues, I don't need it. I initiated a return today (with a sorry heart, I really wanted to like this phone..). Part of me is also angry since it ended up being a huge waste of time. I will have to redo the whole data transfer.Overall,PROS: excellent camera, clean Android and Google assistant + call screeningCONS: sound quality is awful, you run into issues with missing functionality that you are generally used to and the OS has bugs",8
4.0,"Great camera, clean software, adequate phone
  
","June 11, 2019",Yes,"The main reason for getting this phone is the camera. The hardware itself is not that amazing, it's Google's software that makes it spectacular. A $400 phone having a camera this good is incredible.The other reason for getting this phone is the pure Android experience. I don't care for most skins and custom UIs. Most manufacturers, however, seem to have learned that less is more when it comes to customizing the Android UI for their phones, so this is less of an issue today than it was in years past.  Having Google's guarantee of software updates is also very important to me.One other nice feature of the phone is that it has a headphones jack, but no longer has a notification light. I'm somewhat irked by the lack of a notification light, since there's ample space on the bezel for one.Features I'd like to have but find acceptable to be missing in a $400 phone: no wireless charging, no waterproof certification, no extra camera lenses.What I don't quite care for on the phone: slow fingerprint reader, only 4GB of RAM.Comparing this phone to a 2.5 year old OnePlus 3T:1. Fingerprint reader is much faster on the 3T2. Performance on T-Mobile is about the same as on the 3T (I moved the same SIM over to the Pixel 3a) despite the 3T lacking bands 66 and 71. It might be slightly better in some situations. For example, while I occasionally lose mobile Internet on my 3T at work (despite it saying I have LTE), I haven't encountered the same problem on the 3a.3. Does not show ""LTE+"" for Carrier Aggregation. Not a big deal, but it's nice to know.4. Works well most of the time, at least keeping up with the 3T. But would occasionally stutter, and would unload applications in the background more often than on the 3T (the 3T has 6GB of RAM)In fact, it feels VERY similar to the Xiaomi Mi A1, which has Android One. The Xiaomi is about 1.5 years old, and costs half the price, and they managed to include an extra 2x optical zoom lens for the rear camera. The main drawback of the Xiaomi is that it doesn't have most of the US LTE bands, so you're stuck with 3G mobile Internet most of the time.I was quite excited to get and use my OnePlus One, and later OnePlus 3T. This phone doesn't generate the same excitement. After using it for about 3 weeks, I find it to be an adequate phone but not amazing, except for its camera. I'd still use my DSLR for any serious photos, but it is good to know that I have a very capable picture taker in my pocket all the time.",4
5.0,"Worth my money so far
  
","August 1, 2019",Yes,"Pretty satisfied with phone so far. Battery life lasts me the whole day. It feels pretty good in the hand. The screen display has three settings for color: natural, boosted, and adaptive. Adaptive definitely brings out the colors and liveliness in display, but when colors are already bright, it begins to look too saturated. Natural looks a bit too dull for my liking so I settled for boosted. But you could decide what fits you best. I love how there's many options for people who may have special needs. I personally don't use them but it's a nice feature to have because it makes me feel like Google cares about their customer's convenience and needs.The back camera is beautiful even without the Google camera processor, but the front camera is a bit different. Without good lighting video calls may appear blurry. On other apps requiring the use of the front camera, The quality may look a bit too sharpened. But again, it's not a big deal for me.

","July 11, 2019",Yes,"Updated update! The hotspot issue was with my carrier which makes a world of difference in what I think about the phone.  The hype is the camera and I'm a photographer.  The night sight is nothing special whatsoever. It does what it wants to and usually it's not what I'm wanting. But, the phone is good. Pretty fast and I won't curse it anymore  Screw this piece of crap phone.  Good luck getting the hotspot to work which, by looking online, you will see is a problem for everyone.  The phone is nearly useless to me without the hotspot.  I always have bought phones in the $150-$200 range and now I know why.  There is nothing special about this phone.  They make you think the camera is awesome.  I'm a photographer. The camera can do a couple things (photosphere, night shots) that others can't.  Night shots are impossible to get as nice as they want you to believe.  It did horrible on fireworks which was upsetting.  You must have a tripod or something to keep phone completely still as well.  The photosphere is fun...if it were possible to actually get one to turn out.  In short, there is no reason to buy this over something half it's price.  I'm writing after a month of use. Oh, good battery life and quick charge time. Still, the battery is internal, so they decide when it and your phone become deceased.  UPDATED after another month.  Still, yet to find anything to impress me.  One huge problem though.  Outside in 90 degree weather the phone will shut down because it gets hot.  Never had a phone do this.  Sucks!",4

","June 10, 2019",Yes,"I use to be a sucker and get the latest phone from Apple to Samsung spending $1000s of dollars almost every year until I saw the Pixel 3a. I really didn't pay much to it until my co worker told me about it. I decided to see his Pixel phone hands on. I'm quite impressed for hundreds of dollars less you get all the same features in a smart phone that apple and Samsung has out as well. Google does better service then others. You don't really need animoji and other necessities that apple and Samsung charge to us consumers. Night mode on the camera is awesome don't really need to use flash. If you are a Google user as myself then this phone will feel just right. Having home devices connected to Google such as the Google mini and watches makes them easier to use. Best of all is the storage. While Apple and Samsung use phone storage to save photos and videos, Google gives you unlimited data space in their cloud service so every time you snap a picture or videos it gets automatically synced to their service which allows you to have more storage on your device. Oooh and did I mention the phone is only $399!!!!!! Check out the Google store online more information and specs honestly you rather spend over $1000 or $399 you do the math. Thank you Google",4

Google makes great phones that offer good value and a killer camera and the purest android experience. Previously, my mom has been having problems with her older (LG G5 and previous phones as well) always getting slow and buggy over time. This happens, I find, far slower with a pure android experience and the constant, fast updates that Google offers for their phones directly.With the newly released Pixel 3a, being a budget, yet not significantly slower version of the Pixel 3, I knew this was a good deal and an excellent phone choice for my mom. Had this been available when I first was getting my phone, I would have gotten it as well instead of the Pixel 3. Many agree, that the Pixel 3a is a good enough phone that offers value without compromising too much. While you can sometimes notice it being slightly slower, the average use and consumer will not.While it might not have the best specs at this price, I am willing to take a CPU downgrade in order to have the best user and camera experience on a phone.",4

On calls, it would connect but it was so hard to hear it was nearly inaudible. Yes, had others try it too.  All agreed, the worst-sounding cellphone they'd ever experienced.  Indeed, it is being returned as this is written. (Sigh) Yes, the adage does come to mind, you get what you pay for! It's just terrible that even for $400-$500 one takes a risk.

","October 16, 2019",Yes,"Changing phones has its challenges: getting used to the way it operates is one of them. The first thing I marveled at with this phone is the battery life. Astounding! Really. I may never go back to iPhone. I took the leap after the news that Apple was purposefully slowing down older phones. I am happy with all the aspects of this camera EXCEPT... Google automatically puts all photos you take with it into Google Photos. Then, the notice that you don't have enough space and your email will stop coming unless you pay a monthly fee for extra storage. I looked up how to disconnect my phone from Google and basically, you can't. So that's the downside. (Maybe that's any Android?)Here's another piece I love about this phone. When I use the dictation feature, the program has picked up the words I use that are not English but used with my community and friends (transliterated) and that makes it much easier. When I type, the same thing. Why couldn't my iPhone ever get that when I type ""Shabbat"" that it nearly always came with ""Shalom""? My pixel gets it.Very happy with the purchase.PS If I had it to do over, I'd probably get the black instead of the purplish.

3.0,"Should've been great. Plagued with issues
  
","September 19, 2019",Yes,"To preface, I came from an Essential PH-1 that I really loved, but the call quality was just atrocious. I was looking for a budget phone (eh, I can't believe $400 is considered cheap for a phone these days, but I digress) that had stock android, which only leaves the Pixel 3A, as far as I know.Problems:Crashing / freezing - I had this happen numerous times, which ultimately led to me returning the 3A. At first it started refusing to come out of lock screen and would just completely lock. Only way out was to try and get recovery mode started. Then it started freezing while in use. Same thing again - recovery mode was the only thing that would work.Bluetooth - BT volume is laughably bad. On the PH-1, my car stereo would be at 25-30 volume. With the 3A, I was at 40-45. Yes, it still works technically. But that is almost maxed out and I'm only at a normal listening level. After googling the issue, it seems to be a fairly common complaint.Annoyances:Stock Android - After using the PH-1 for a few years, I grew to love having complete control over android and was expecting the same from the 3A. It's better than other bloatware loaded phones out there, but there are so many Google crapware apps that can't be uninstalled. Knowing Google's reputation for spying on people and data mining, I can only assume this is why you can't uninstall their apps. If you value your privacy at all, this may not be the phone for you.Good:Battery life - It's true, the battery life is stellar. I would typically get one day out of my PH-1. On the 3A, one day I forgot to plug it in the night before and managed to get through an entire second day.  So roughly double SOT of my PH-1.Screen - OLED screen on a $400 phone seems like a great deal.Meh:Build quality - It definitely feels cheap. I get it's ""only a $400 phone"" but I'd prefer if a $400 device didn't feel like a tupperware lid.Ultimately, I had to return it. If it's already crashing and freezing in the first few weeks, lord knows it's only going to get worse later on.",3

5.0,"Coming from Huawei P20 Pro
  
","September 7, 2019",Yes,"My wife got a Pixel 3 when it first came out last year.  I liked it but didn't think it was worth the $1000 price tag.  I was using a new Huawei P20 Pro that was known as the camera King in the smartphone game with a triple camera including a 40 MP sensor and unbelievable low light pictures.  Then my wife got her Pixel 3 with it's one camera making my pictures look, well bad.  I finally decided to pull the trigger on the Pixel 3a after a lot of consideration.  At the time of purchase, the regular Pixel 3 dropped to just $499 in price.  I thought about going with that but decided that I don't use wireless charging, liked the idea of a plastic phone over a glass back since I like to rock my phone no case, liked the headphone jack, and don't really care about the wide angle selfie cam.  The things I do like about the regular Pixel 3 are the better processor, dedicated photo processor, and free photo storage at full original quality.  But decided to go with the 3a and save $100.So far, I don't regret the purchase.  I still have my P20 Pro as a back up phone too.  The camera on this does absolutely blow that one away which makes it worth it to me as that is my biggest priority and I'm guessing it is most people's as well.One thing is apparent right away to me and that is battery life.  Yes, it charges fast and I pretty much have access to chargers everywhere I go (home, work, car, etc) but my P20 could go two full days on a charge.  I could leave for work at 100% and come home 9 hours later at 92%!  It was nice.  This thing lasts way way shorter.  It has gone 100 to 60 in only a few hours with very light use.But I love the display, the speakers are some of the best I've ever heard on a phone, the camera is literally stunning, and I like the simplicity on styling and operating system.It gets a 9 out of 10 from me and that is because of the camera and price.Update 1:  After using for a few days still loving the phone and found out a big factor on battery life.  I had the ""Lift to Awake Screen"" activated on the Always on Display.  After turning that off, the battery life has gotten quite a bit better.  I didn't like that anyways because the screen would constantly go to my lock screen just holding the phone in my hand or pocket.  You could also greatly improve battery life by turning the Always on Display ""off"" completely but I really like it on.I am really liking the stock android OS and I forgot to mention, my phone updated to Android 10 on the first night, one day after the release.  You can't beat updates like that!  And my 3a hasn't had any of the ""pixel problems"" that many other Pixel 3 owners faced after going to Android 10.",2

","November 12, 2019",Yes,"What I wanted with this phone was to move off my old device smoothly and upgrade to a new phone without the need to go to the Verizon store and without spending $1000 on a flagship model.  I received the Pixel 3a and started to set it up.  Part of the setup was to connect the phone to your old phone and bring over apps and data which is really cool.  Contacts came over automatically from Google and when I pulled the sim card out of my old phone and placed it into the Pixel 3a, it just worked.  Period.  It was the smoothest transition I have had.  The Pixel 3a is slightly 'taller' and 'thinner' than my old phone (an LG G5).  The phone is very easy to use and the display is awesome.  The camera appears to be excellent as well which was one of my priorities.  I have had to spend some time getting used to all of the new stuff and I have been playing with it this morning for 5-6 hours.  The battery life is still at 93%.  I really like the look and feel of it.  I also liked the fact that this device could be brought over to another carrier if I chose to switch.  The phone is CDMA and GSM compatible so it's truly unlocked and not tied to any specific carrier.  It was new in the box, fully sealed and in perfect, brand new condition.  For those looking for a flexible, unlocked phone with great features without spending a ton of money on a flashy, high-end model... this is your phone.",2

5.0,"I have a full Pixel 3 XL for work, and was excited for the 3a XL hit the market.  Highly Recommended
  
","August 31, 2019",Yes,"After several years of growing tired of my Samsung Galaxy work phones getting slower and more bloated with the Samsung UI, I was convinced by coworkers to go to a Pixel.  I got the Pixel 3 XL and instantly loved it.  Seconds, rather than minutes, to boot.  A fast UI experience.  Frequent and comprehensive OS updates that aren't lagging months behind the Android updates.  A fantastic camera.  What's not to love?Even though I refer to my Pixel 3 XL as my work phone, the truth is that I haven't had a personal phone in over a decade... who wants to carry two phones?  Then again, there is something to be said about having a healthy work/life balance.  With that in mind, I was curious when I heard about the 3a coming to the market... as much as I love the 3 XL, I can't say that I was super excited to spend $900 on a phone.  When the 3a XL dropped below $300 (after the deal that gave you a $100 GC), it seemed like a no brainer.As someone that has both a 3XL and a 3a XL, here's what I can tell you:SCREENUnlike the 3 XL, the 3a XL has no screen ""notch"".  Where there are some parts of the UI that take advantage of the notch, there are just as many applications that leave an annoying color (non-black) artifact in the notch area when watching landscape full-screen video - it's SUPER annoying.  The 3a XL's screen is slightly smaller than the 3 XL, and while it's also a little lower resolution, the density (as a result of the smaller diagonal measurement) doesn't drop that much.  In general usage I don't notice any difference.  The 3a's screen is OLED, but it appears to be a quality tier below the 3 XL's... you can see it if they are side-by-side, but you wouldn't notice it if you were going from memory.CAMERAPixel phones are renown for their camera performance.  While the raw specs tend to be behind other flagship phones' optics and CCDs, the actual picture quality tends to be at or near the top of the heap.  The Pixel 3a XL is no different, as the rear camera is the same as the one on the 3 XL.  The front camera (which I really don't care as much about) goes with a single, rather than a dual, camera setup.  It's not the same as either front-facing camera on the Pixel 3 XL, but the software (which is largely responsible for the picture quality), is the same.  Both cameras appear to be excellent.FORM FACTORThe Pixel 3a XL is slightly larger than the Pixel 3 XL.  Some of it may be due to the notch-less screen causing the speaker and camera to be mounted above the screen.  Some may be due to the larger capacity battery.  Perhaps it's also influenced by the case material on the back being made of plastic, rather than glass.  Regardless, the phone is about 10% lighter, which is enough to be noticable.  An omission that I don't love is that the 3a XL does not support wireless chaging... it's not the end of the world, but it is missed.PERFORMANCEThe 3a XL does have a significantly slower CPU than the 3 XL.  The layout of both processors is to have 4 high speed cores, and 4 slower cores.  The general idea is that the system workloads can be managed by the OS'es thread scheduler, and be placed on to the lowest power consuming core that is still adequate for the job.  Both phones are fine with multitasking.  I didn't actually notice any performance difference is the UI or in application speeds, but I also am not a mobile gamer... I would expect for the difference to be most obvious there (assuming there is one).  I was a little surprised when the 3 XL came out with 4GB of RAM (since I didn't know if that would be enough), but that worked out well.  The 3a XL has the same 4GB of RAM and therefore has similar performance.NOTABLE DIFFERENCES NOT ALEADY MENTIONEDOddly, the Pixel 3a XL has a headphone jack.  That's noteworthy because the 3 XL does NOT have a headphone jack.  I know there are some ""purists"" that are anti-bluetooth, but I'd say that a phone is not an audiophile platform anyway.  Even if you have awesome $1500 headphones, I can still tell you that the DAC in your sub-170 gram phone is junk (comparatively).  One of the really nice features of the Pixel 3 XL is that it's waterproof... the 3a XL is not.  It's not a dealbreaker for me, but I can see where this would affect some peoples' choices.In conclusion, I thought the deal I got on Amazon when I bought my 3a XL was so good that I bought the phone without even knowing if I'd get a service plan for it.  Now that the 3a XL is at its ""normal"" price I still think it's an incredible deal, and I really question anyone who would buy a different phone at this device's price point.  Highly Recommended.",2

","June 26, 2019",Yes,"What is differentiates the phone these days? If your answer is the bezel or the 'notch', this phone may not appeal to you. But for someone like me, who likes a simple phone with a great screen and an excellent camera at a reasonable price, Pixel 3A came out at the very top of the list.  The screen is a stunning OLED screen with the highest resolution that my eye can discern. It is very almost impossible to see individual pixels and the images look crisp, with a great contrast ratio.  As a result, the pictures look amazing and reading on the screen is a joy. The best part of the phone is a great camera that takes great pictures. To me, this is the big differentiating factor among phones these days. All phones are more or less the same on other commonly used features. The pictures are really excellent, with almost an DSLR-level quality to them. A true Android OS with no wizardry programmed on top of the OS means that the system is very simple, yet fully functional. You may have to download some apps that you are used to, but this simplicity makes the phone very appealing to me. There is only one drawback on the phone: Lack of an external SD memory storage.  Perhaps one doesn't need a lot of storage if we store all our data on the cloud, but lack of an external memory option is nevertheless disappointing.In summary, if you value your hard earned money enough not to throw it on gimmicks like the 'Notch free screen',  'edge screens' or some random sensor (that you probably would never use), Pixel 3A should rank very high on your list.Over the past 4-5 years, phones have rapidly evolved, perfected and commoditized. Phone manufacturers rely on customers paying premiums for gimmickry to keep their margins elevated. There is no reason to pay $1000 for a phone which can do very little that is different from a $300-$400 phone.",2

","December 18, 2019",Yes,"By far the worst phone I've ever purchased.  My old $200 android phone from a Chinese manufacture worked better than the Goolge Pixel 3a XL.  The camera app freezes, sometimes for 10 min and I have to restart the phone.  Otherwise the fact that the camera is outstanding is the only positive hardware I've found on the phone. The two features that are actually well done are the ability to squeeze the phone and turn off alarms or incoming calls. Second, double press the power button and the camera comes up.  Pretty much every other aspect is below the market standard. The fact that there is no indicator light is simply unacceptable and I wish I knew that fact prior to purchasing.  Often times apps crash for no reason. Overall the Google operating system is just horrible, and I've had the phone for five months.  The battery life is only slightly better than my five year old phone, and last for a day and a half on average.  Overall I expected much more from Google.",1

","June 29, 2019",Yes,"This is a great phone for the money!  The OLED screen looks great and is plenty bright, the phone seems fast even though the processor is mid-level speed, and it is unlocked so will work with any carrier - in short, a great value for someone that doesn't want to spend north of $800 for a fancy phone!  The camera is superb - on a par with much more expensive phones!  It doesn't have the usually installed bloatware found on most other phones (even NO facebook, yay!), but there is a lot of Google software that you will want to review before using.  Be careful with giving the Google apps permissions if you have security/privacy concerns - true on any phone.  Though the phone is constructed with polycarbonate materials, not glass or metal, it still feels great in my hand with a good solid feel to its construction.  Finally, the pure Google Pie operating system is a joy to use!  There are many other features that work well on this device, but I would run very long on this review - check out the mostly positive reviews on the web for more info.

5.0,"Excellent upgrade to Pure Android
  
","October 3, 2019",Yes,"Decided to upgrade from Samsung Galaxy s8 because of s8's declining battery life and rumored lack of update to Android 10. Glad I made the switch. Other than larger and easier to read the battery life for the 3a xl is over one day, easy to navigate as there is no carrier bloatware, get immediate updates from Google, and has most if not all of the features that my Galaxy had.There are a couple of cons that while are not deal breakers should be noted and that is that there is no wireless charge capabilities and the top microphone hole looks surprisingly like a sim card ejection fitting. I would suggest that maybe Google should place a removable tag over the hole showing that it is not a sim card area. Moving from Samsung people could mistake the hole and try to insert the sim removal tray tool.All in all, this phone has excellent call reception and clarity both inbound and outbound. And, doesn't cost an arm and a leg!",1

","August 26, 2019",Yes,"Google - Pixel 3a XL with 64GB Memory is a very nice phone.It runs smoothly, and the Dragontrail glass seems just fine.But the battery life is suspect. It barely lasts for a day, even with minimal usage. I was expecting much better results, since the 3a XL battery was emphasized as larger, than the smaller 3a battery. That's why I only rated it 4 stars. I even bought a Newdery battery case for extra charging, to improve battery life.The camera is just fine. I am used to excellent Google phone cameras, so it is not a big deal to me.64gb of space seems okay. I just loaded about 6gb of MP3 files for easy access to music.The speakers at the bottom of the phone are okay, but the front-facing speakers that I had on my Nexus 6P were better.My advice is to avoid this phone if you need strong battery life.

Their claim of 7 hours of battery life after 15 minutes of charging is a little far fetched but it is still very good and I really don't find myself needing to charge more than once per day. The fingerprint scanner can sometimes be annoying when it doesn't recognize your finger but it's not often that it happens. All in all I'm very happy with it and am glad I got it. It could however have a little bit bigger battery because if you are a heavy streamer or play games alot I could see it needing charged at least twice per day.

I have owned it for 3 weeks now so have been able to give it a good once over.  Negatives are there is no dot notification on the 3a so it requires you to turn on the phone to check for emails, texts, etc.  I also use wifi calling extensively as At&amp;t. has a poor signal in my neighborhood.  Wifi calling works but tends to drop any call longer than about 15 minutes.  Not a huge deal for me as I'm retired and doing long work related calls anymore but it could be an issue for many.I will most likely keep the phone as the price was right, setup was easy and functionality is adequate for me at this stage in my life.

The plastic actually feels very good against the skin.  I prefer plastic because it is lighter to hold and less potential for damage if dropped.  With how cheap it is, I don't mind water resistance, though I would pay more for that option.  There's really nothing else to comment on, everything is awesome about this phone.",2
5.0,"So far so good....
  
","December 20, 2019",Yes,"This phone has been flawless in the month in which I have owned it. Can't think of any issues that have arisen. Everything works fine. I especially like the adaptive brightness feature in which brightness is automatically reduced in a darkened room and brightened conversely when everything around brightens up. And of course the camera is astounding!  The ability to take phenomenal pictures in almost any setting is simply amazing!  The fingerprint sensor, for me works perfectly and consistently.  Moving over to this phone from my old phone and setting it up was a piece of cake. I'm on Mint Mobile which is a T-Mobile reseller. Between using the supplied transfer cable and moving the sim card over there wasn't really very much that needed to be done. To me, the OLED display looks just fine. As far as speed is concerned, I have absolutely no complaints. The 3000 mah battery sees me through the day without running out and needing a charge. That's all I ask of it. As long as I can just charge it overnight I am perfectly happy. It's great having the latest version of Android with updates coming in as well. The sound quality, to me is perfectly fine. YouTube TV, nor other apps  do not come across as being tinny in sound. The sound seems well balanced.  Bluetooth works flawlessly.  Considering the trend towards more and more enormous phones the size and form factor of the Pixel 3a feels perfect in my hand and fits nicely in my pocket.I'm aware that Google sacrificed wireless charging, being waterproof and a few other features to get the cost down. None of that matters to me. It nonetheless includes a headphone jack, which other manufacturers have eliminated in their latest phones. That's a feature I find very important.There isn't really anything this phone can't do for me that a flagship Samsung or Apple iPhone can do at 2 to 3 times the cost.So, if this phone continues to run the way it has been for the past month, I would be very pleased.However, the number of reviews showing up with all sorts of failures after only a few months of use is very disconcerting.  Understandably those Pixell 3a users are very upset.While I realize corners were cut in terms of features to get the price down, I would think the effort would have been put into assuring reliability as much as possible regardless of the economic considerations made into producing this phone because they have obviously produced a run away best seller  while providing real competition for much more expensive flagship phones costing 2 to 3 times as much.So again the question is how well will this phone be working after the 4 or 5 months of use in which, from the reviews I've seen, failures begin to show up?So far so good but only time will tell.",0

","December 12, 2019",Yes,"This phone started out great. It was fast and did everything it was supposed to do. One day, I was listening to something through the speaker on the phone and it started to crackle. I thought I'd blown out the speaker at first. Additionally, when I answered the phone it took 3 solid seconds for anyone to be able to hear me and even when it kicked in they would tell me it sounded like I was far away from the phone. I didn't have that a issue when on Bluetooth.Looked it up on Google and it seemed like this was a decently common issue with this phone and it was a software issue. To resolve it, it said to remove the last downloaded apps. I did that but what ended up working was to delete all of the saved data from the apps. Suddenly, my phone calls worked better and my speaker works for listening to music/ audio books just fine. Still doesn't work for phone calls on speaker. Clearly, this is not an issue with the hardware. Now I've lost all the settings for my apps which is quite frustrating.Of course, all of this happened literally one week out of the return window. Now it seems to be having trouble charging as of this week. Nothing has ever physically happened to this phone to cause this. I really am just waiting for this phone to kick the bucket and I only bought it 2 months ago. I would attempt a return, but then I'd be without a phone. What a complete waste of money and time.",0

This is a big deal for me as I have a few nice pairs of ear buds and headphones I still like to use with my phones. Most of the flagship devices are getting rid of this and makes me sad.If I had one tiny gripe, with a 64GB rom I would've hoped for microSD expansion. Really this isn't a big deal for me, I keep up with the storage on my devices, but for some that like carry large media libraries it may be a deal breaker. It also doesn't look as premium as devices that have edge-to-edge screens like the latest iphones and other flagship devices, but really it's a 1/3 of the  price of these devices.

That phone took a beating and it held up for over two years. Now it will be given to my sister. So I had high expectations. But this phone is much better. The screen resolution although has similar specs to the 2, looks much crisper and full of color that when compared to the 2, is obvious.The headphone Jack was also a huge plus factor. The extra piece necessary to plug in headphones on the last two pixels falls out and got annoying. The camera is impressive, I'm still shocked on some of the pictures being taken, especially when the Pixel 2 had such a great camera.And finally the hardware. The phone has absolutely no noticeable lag and performs just as great as the two. I use my phone with multiple apps open doing a lot of multitasking and had no issue. The one thing I don't do is play serious games on my phone so I couldn't attest there, I usually wait till I get home to play Xbox which would be much more enjoyable.All in all, great phone. The only bummer about the entire phone, is the lack of waterproofing. I've seen videos where they test what the pixel 3a can take in terms of water and it holds up well.

","September 7, 2019",Yes,"I'm replacing my old 2017 Samsung Galaxy J7 with a Google Pixel 3a as my everyday smartphone.  My likes are fast fingerprint unlock and generally quick and smooth touch screen operation.  My dislikes are 18.5:9 aspect ratio.  Maybe it takes time getting used to the narrow screen. General brightness is weak compared to Galaxy J7.  And it seems to be more sensitive to heat than other phones.  When shooting video with Samsung Galaxy S10e and Moto G7, phones didn't complain and worked as usual.  Pixel 3a displayed a warning stating that function will be limited due to heat...or something to that nature.  It was 100 degrees that day.  So it was hot in Texas.  But other phones were fine or gave no warning. When left in a car with no A/C, phone was found powered down. When powered back on, there was a warning about excessive heat. I think I will have to ditch the phone case to let it cool down faster.  I will keep using it for now and see.",0

It's not the absolute sexiest piece of hardware around (the screen bezels are pretty big compared to most other recent generation flagship phones). But it's less than half the price of those phones, and that's literally the only downside. It probably performs better in almost every other way (especially the camera and the battery).

However, it was time for an update.Pros: The Pixel 3a is sleek, easier to hold, and much easier to get to my apps.  The battery lasts anywhere between 2 &amp; 3 days, and I like that the percentage left is on the top right corner.  A major deciding factor for me, was the headphone jack, which I can't live without.  It's operating speed is definitely faster than my old phone.Cons: The camera on my previous phone had a wide screen option which I adored and miss on this phone.  Also, the camera itself on the V20 seemed to take clearer picture in the day to day, although the Pixels detail when steadily focused is a great improvement.  The only other wish that was not granted was external storage capability, as there is no place for an SD card.In the end, I'm glad I chose this phone.  I highly recommend.",0

It has a Google oriented OS which was perfect for me since all my accounts were with the FREE Google services.

No, it doesn't have 3 lenses, but I I don't care. My only complaint about this phone is that it doesn't have an expandable memory card slot. So if I take a lot of photos and videos, they can fill up the remaining storage I have rather quickly.

","August 5, 2019",No,"Just to set the record, I do have a Pixel 3a and also have an iPhone XR. Previously had an iPhone 7.  Just shooting out a warning here..it is not a better phone than an iPhone 7 . Camera is something, but if you are a previous iphone user or perhaps have something like a 7 7Plus or newer, please don't think you are upgrading. Get it if you broke your phone and need a phone right away, but trust me, camera is not everything. This phone is still a budget phone and works amazingy for anyone who uses budget phones or haven't upgraded to a new phone in 5 years. Works even for those who are looking for a secondary phone , but anyone who have been carrying around an iPhone 7 or a Samsung S8,  you gonna start missing out features (taptic engine/notifications/speaker quality etc)  that can only be found on premium phones. Also the call quality is just not the best on this and the speakers aren't loud enough, especially in loud environments you may struggle to hear . Again, many people are reviewing a camera here and forget about the phone.Other good features I'd say is recoginzing music playing around you and the always on display, those are nice things beside the camera, but this phone will not replace your iphone 7 or better or Samsung S8/S9 in no circumstances. If you are used to those already with their wireless charging or clarity of the call and many other extra features, you are going to get disappointed.  All the other people who stick with budget phones this might do well.",7
5.0,"A Game Changer!
  
","July 11, 2019",No,"It is good that many companies are offering budget, mid-range, and premium Android phones according to consumer's need. The consumers then have choices according to their need or preference. However as everyone knows - the camera quality in budget and mid-range phones simply cannot compete with iPhones or more expensive Android phones. For me, I don't care about the camera, just meeting my daily needs on the phone - so I just use budget to mid-range phones (so Moto E4 and X4 are more than sufficient for me). But my wife, no 1 priority in her phone is the camera. Performance and battery life, she doesn't really care. But we BOTH do not want to spend $1000 on a phone.Enter Pixel 3a. This smartphone is a game changer. At $399, it has enough power to satisfy every day users (non-gamers) and those who love to take great pictures. Snapdragon 670 is faster than Moto X4 (sd 630) and Xperia XZs (sd 820). Armed with 4GB RAM it can handle every day tasks well. But when it comes to the performance of its camera - it has been universally praised (just check YouTube reviews on it). It really does take better pictures than iPhones (6,7,8, XR) and some of the premium Android phones. My wife is SOOOOO happy with this phone! It performs better and takes amazing pictures than her Xperia XZs. And it only costs $399.HINTS:1. Once you get the phone, you might not see your phone charging. Don't panic. That's OK. [It was for me too. It was stuck at 84%]. Leave it hooked up. Just update all the security patches. Once you have the most recent security patch updated. Then -&gt;2. Factory Reset your phone. This will ensure erase all the glitches and have clean install of your Android Pie. You will also note that the phone is charging normally (fast charging works as intended).3. Download your apps and enjoy the phone!4. Get a good case and tempered glass screen protector. Pixel 3a comes with Dragontrail Glass and not Gorilla Glass. They are similar in quality, but Dragontrail is little better with scratches than GG, but GG is little better with drop test. So you just want to reinforce the screen with tempered glass protection. So when it is dropped, then tempered glass will shatter but protects Pixel 3a screen.Overall, we are completely satisfied with Pixel 3a. My wife really loves the phone! So if you want to take great pictures and to see snappy performance of the phone but don't want to spend $1000, then Pixel 3a is BEST choice. Highly recommended!",7

5.0,"GET IT
  
","June 30, 2019",No,"Don't waste your money on a $1000 phone, unless you absolutely positively need the specs of a flagship. This phone is perfect for 99% of people (there are even great $300 phones now that would satisfy 75% of people!).  Anyway, for the past few years, I've paid cash for my phones and used them on prepaid networks to save money. Pre-Pixel 3a XL I had a Moto G7, which is a good phone on paper, especially for $300, but it was filled with buggy software issues. So I 'splurged' (for me) and got the 3a XL.  The biggest standout of this phone is the excellent camera, especially if you like landscape shots (mountains, sunsets, etc). The colors pop just right and the clarity is amazing. It is also a fast camera with no processing lag post-shot. There are some cool features baked into the phone but I think what most people will find great is the cam. The two minor downsides are, there is no micro-SD expansion slot, and the bezels around the screen are big for 2019. I knew that going into it, and neither is a deal breaker for me.  Otherwise, the 3a/XL is plenty fast (it actually feels faster than it should - I've read that Google has excellent software optimization). Everything works as it should. Bluetooth connects fast to all my devices.  And just to give you an example as to a major benefit of a Google device - if a bug is found, there is a forum to post about it, and the developers post updates on the resolution.  I didn't buy this phone from Amazon, but when I find a product or service I feel strongly about, I like to share my experience. I highly recommend anyone looking for a new phone check out the 3a or 3a XL. Even if you think you *need* a Galaxy S10, you probably don't. Check this one out first. Save yourself the $500 and spend it on some other tech toy instead.",5

","June 27, 2019",No,"I was switching from an iPhone 6 (all I’ve owned is iPhones), and I really wanted to love the Pixel 3a and the notion of a pure Android experience. And some things were really slick. But this phone is fundamentally flawed. The Pixel 3a fails at a couple critical things every phone can do (even my old iPhone).(1) Creates a really inconsistent / wonky connection with Honda Bluetooth systems, making it unusable. [Google’s suggestion was that I should sell my couple-year-old Honda and buy a new car with Android Auto.

Google eventually took it back. In the process, Google dragged its feet on responding to me until my trade-in phone had been irretrievably lost in their system, and now they’re refusing to give me market value for my phone.

5.0,"The Mainstream Pixel (Follow-up Review)
  
","July 9, 2019",No,"All too many reviewers approached the Pixel 3a and 3aXL as alternative to a flagship - I didn't. I looked at the Pixel 3a as being a mainstream/midrange ""utility infielder"" of a phone that is actually priced sanely - all too many phones - especially flagships - aren't.  I was coming from the Samsung Galaxy S7 - a flagship of its day - and I was the second owner.  The S7 has a rather large screen - and flagship screens have gotten larger since; look at the S10 - even the S10e.  Phones that size have definite ""pocket issues"" - as in too big for most pockets.  Shirts, jeans,etc., - and then you wonder why ""butt-dialing"" happens.  The 3a, on the other hand, fits nicely into a FRONT pocket - which makes the ""butt dial"" flatly impossible.  (You can't dial with your kiester if you aren't sitting on your phone.)  It doesn't support SD cards - something I hardly used on my S7.  (I still have the 32 GB SD card I bought the same time I got the phone, and it's not even half full.  Therefore, not that big a deal.)  One thing that has been bragged on with Pixels in general - and this one in particular - is the camera.  Surprise - it matters much less - at least to me.  In the year I had the S7 in service, I took less than twenty pictures with it.  Yes, you read that right - twenty.  Unless things change radically, I don't see that number taking off, even with the Pixel 3a at hand..  One issue that certainly mattered to me is the length of support -typical smartphone update support runs for two years or the same number of major releases - even for flagships.  Two companies- and only two - go longer than that - Apple and Google.  Apple is not exactly a featured name in the sane end of smartphone pricing; until recently, the Google Pixel was not in the sane end of pricing either  the 3a (and bigger-brother 3aXL) differ from previous Pixels in the US another way - it's not chained to Verizon like an ill-tempered pit bull.  You can put it on almost any carrier without having to jump through any hoops.  I'm on Tracfone, and have been getting solid service from them; therefore, I did not want to leave them, if at all avoidable.  With the 3a, I didn't have to leave.  Remove SIM from S7 - insert in 3a.  That's it.  Easier than migrating from a Big Four carrier.  (And all from the comfort of my bedroom sitting chair after lunch.)  Q-based operations has been just as free from pain; I signed up (online, and from my desktop) within an hour of unpacking the phone itself, with the first drop showing up over OTA within fifteen minutes of that.  (Tracfone, remember?)  So far, I have a grand total of ONE issue with Q - and it's a quibble - no dark-mode launch screen with beta 5/RC1 - despite enabling systemwide dark mode starting with beta 4.  That's it.  Why I bought it, and why I recommend it - are easy enough to explain - it's a mainstream utility-infielder of a phone that does what you need it to, will be supported for at least three years (if not forever, which is Pixel Practice - remember, even the original Pixel is still getting OS and security updates); it has nothing to do with the camera.  #teampixel  #whatcamera?FOLLOW UP - It's October 25th; said Pixel 3a is still going strong.  I'm putting it to uses I haven't - and would not dare - do any other phone.  I have actually streamed TV to it; something that would normally be the province of either my TV or my tablet.  So why the Pixel?  It has an AMOLED display - which only one TV in the house does - and it isn't the one in MY bedroom.  You read that right - AMOLED at a sane price.  Basketball (the WNBA Finals, to be precise).  College football.  The NFL.  The MLB postseason (from the NLDS to the World Series).  None of it has a single issue on the clear AMOLED display of my Pixel 3a.  Also, the camera is actually getting a workout - because the pictures are so clear and crisp, I am using it to take pictures of receipts for item exchange.  (And that is before updating the APK to Camera 7.x from the Pixel 4 - which is also available to all other Pixels.)  My mom is even pickier about pictures than I am - for that reason, she purchased a refurbished original Pixel herself - and then promptly started kicking herself; she turned DOWN getting a 3a or 3a XL for Mother's Day.  (Her option - and from me.)  If you can find a decent refurbished Pixel, that's an option as well.",5
5.0,"The right phone for many of us
  
","June 9, 2019",No,"I didn’t need my pixel 3a.  I had a Huawei mate 10 Pro which I got a good deal on.  What prompted me to change was that my wife wanted a phone with a better camera,  and I like the idea of guaranteed updates for 3 years.  My wife took my mate 10 Pro and I bought a pixel 3a for $399 with a $100 gift card to a store I shop often enough at to make the price for me $299 actual.Likes:Screen: it is a slightly above full HD screen with it being 5.6 Inch the pixels are packed tight.  I have heard some say the screen is a bit oversaturated and I am inclined to believe it.  Still, though pixel 3a has a  very sharp OLED display.  I still like my mate more even though it is not as sharp.Performance: with a 670 snapdragon, that is about as powerful as an 835 from a couple of years ago, the performance is good.  I just realistically, can’t believe many folks would complain about this.  Storage is adequate with 64 GB.Camera: I am not a camera pro or anywhere close.  I appreciate a good camera on a phone because it makes someone like me look like I know how to take good shots.  This camera achieves that.  I hear all the reviews that rant and rave about the pixel camera and I am just not much a camera guy to know what it all means but at the end of the day it takes good looking photos.OS:  I have used many phones with their own Android skin on top, and it feels refreshing to use a phone with stock android.  The experience is good and I enjoy the simple user experience.Battery life: Great.  I charge my phone every 2 days and I could probably go to 2.5 or possibly more without charging.  I use my phone lightly throughout the day.Neutral:Design:  the pixel 3a has a vanilla design.  It is long with large for today’s standards lower and upper bezels.  The phone is not ugly just not exciting either.  It reminds me of the older iPhone models that were not exciting compared to other phones but worked well and didn’t look unattractive either.Build:  The phone is made of polycarbonate (plastic) which is not a problem for me, but I have used phones with better builds at this same price range. The back picks up smears easily.Features:  there is no wireless charging, which is not a huge deal for me because I have only 1 phone with it and never used it. No waterproofing is a bummer but again not major it just means during a heavy rainstorm I have to be careful.Dislike:Screen rotation:  must have got the software from Sony because my biggest annoyance is the screen rotation.  When I am using my phone in portrait mode, sometimes it will just auto-rotate to landscape-way too sensitive.  I know I can turn auto-rotate off but I am used to using it.No, hide the navigation bar:  on my mate phone, I was able to hide the nav bar when browsing which gave me extra screen real estate.Conclusion:I like the phone it has the early iPhone feel I mentioned earlier with just being simple to use and vanilla looking.  I like that this is a first party phone and works with other Android compatible products pretty seamlessly.  If you are like me and have used many different brands you know of the perks I have having your phone just being compatible with all things.  Nothing worse than getting the phone you want then having it be incompatible with your smartwatch, or android auto.  Stock apps just worked out of the box, like visual voice mail.  I have a pixel slate and do not suffer any glitches when linking my pixel 3s like when I would link my mate 10 Pro.  For an average everyday user, there is nothing to dislike.  It is probably not a phone for someone who wants the most premium high-end phones with the latest greatest but it does offer a focal point for those of us that want a nice phone but don’t want to break the bank.The problem with Android, in my opinion, has been oversaturation.  There are a lot of nice phones but finding ones that work on your network, work with all features in your country and other compatibility issues can be an exercise in frustration.  The pixel 3a is a brand name phone with a mid-range price that can help with people feeling overwhelmed when shopping for a phone.  There are certainly better-looking phones, better priced, better specs, nothing but the pixel 3a puts a lot of features you want in a recognized name brand without emptying your wallet.",4

This is especially helpful when depositing checks.- Apps like Tesla actually works much better.- Even though it uses a budget processor, the apps and phone's functions are very snappy (Android system on Android phone helps?)- Battery is amazing and the fast charging is as promised.

I can only use the power button to execute this function.- Can't think of another but will update is anything arises.Update: speaking of update, just installed new Android 10 and it's even snappier than ever. You may have to manually search for the new software in your setting like I did since it wasn't pushed.- Dark mode is great.- Phone feels quicker.- New gestures.- Improved battery life (maybe because of dark mode?)?- Still no double tab to turn off screen, only double tab to turn on.",4

","August 5, 2019",No,"I've had Android phones going back to the Samsung Galaxy S3.  I really do like Samsung phones, however when they came out with the S10 line and their ""cheap"" phone was $750, this made me pause.  I had an unlocked Galaxy S7 and it was a very solid phone, however, i got updates way slower than everyone else since it was unlocked and updates first went to the major carriers.  But then....Google announced the ""a"" versions of their Pixels and this totally got my attention.  You still get the same Pixel camera (which even iPhone users know is the best phone camera available) with instant updates for half the price of a ""regular"" Pixel.  Sure, it doesn't have wireless charging, but honestly, that's far from a deal breaker.  Sure, it's not waterproof, but, i've never come close to needing that with a phone in the past, so why should that matter.  Sure, it doesn't have as fast of a processor as a regular Pixel, but i'm not a heavy gamer so it doesn't matter at all.  Anyway, the things they had to ""skimp"" in order to lower the price really don't matter.  This is a very nice phone and at this point, i'm hooked on Pixel.  The screen is bright and clear.  The battery life is totally amazing...you really don't even have to charge it every day...i still do because i always want as much juice as possible.  This thing is also quite zippy with opening apps and so on.  I will miss the expandable memory card from my Galaxy, but, that is the only thing i miss at this point.  The pros far outweigh the cons with this phone.  I hope they keep making ""a"" version of the Pixel going forward...if they do, i'm a Pixel owner for life!",3

I know it is slightly more than my past range, but I finally wanted a phone that does more, but doesn't cost an arm and a leg. I read tons of reviews and watched several videos to make sure I'm not wasting my money (it's still a huge junk of change for me). I can say with delight, this phone is amazing.Pros:- The camera is wonderful, it makes great pictures in low light, at night and has so many filters and options...

","June 18, 2019",No,"The screen, camera, and battery life alone make this phone a solid value for it's price. That doesn't even get a list of this device's pros started. It's built and maintained by Google with guaranteed updates for three-years. There is hardly a noticeable difference between I and it's pricier sibling and if you have the Google branded case applied, anyone on the street would be hard-pressed to tell the two apart based on aesthetics alone. Once you pick it up, there still is not a notable difference in day to day use, or speed doing all the phone things that phones do. This device might be a hair slower to process certain tasks, but not enough to discount it's nearly halved price tag.Before this phone I used the Moto G7, and while a great feeling phone, I chose to keep the pixel 3a as my daily driver and have the G7 to a family member who now also has one of the top budget phones. The G7 just doesn't have that Pixel wow, that kept me picking it up over the latter.Hopefully Google will continue this trend with a Pixel 4a, if I can keep from picking up the Pixel 4 after rejoining the Pixel family after the Nexus program began to flop miserably. This 3a though, is reminiscent of the Nexus glory days of the Nexus 4 and 5x.",3

Lots of clever polish to the UI.- Camera is great. Significantly better than my 6S, though not as good as the iPhone 11.- Size is on the smaller side, at least relative to what's available, which I was looking for in a phone. I'd prefer if it were even smaller, but unfortunately there doesn't seem to be a market for it.- Battery is generally good. Not great, but enough to get me through the day.Cons- Screen scratches very easily. I never used a screen protector during my many years of using iPhones. I simply never needed one, despite dropping my phone many times. I dropped my 3A once and it caused a noticeable scratch across the center of the screen. (Now I bought a screen protector, of course!)- I've needed to calibrate the compass around every week or so. Not sure why it needs to be done so frequently.- Maybe it's a problem with WhatsApp and not the phone, but answering phone calls on WA is a huge pain. I swipe up to answer but that simply changes it to a different to two bubble icons, and those don't work either when I press the one to answer.- No waterproofing and no wireless charging. I wonder whether they don't have these features because they are really so costly to implement or if it was just a way to further differentiate the phone from the Pixel 3 and 4.Overall the phone is a great value.

5.0,"Premium Features at an Economical Price
  
","July 18, 2019",No,"In this current arms race where the big players compete to offer flagship phones with ever increasing prices, often in excess of $1000, it is great to see a quality mid-range offering from Google. The Pixel 3A is Google’s mid-range offering, priced lower than its more expensive sibling, the Pixel 3. At this price-point, the Pixel 3A offers a great value.The best thing about Pixel phones is their outstanding photo quality. This quality is achieved through a combination of hardware and the Pixel’s photo software. The software is so exceptional at creating great photos that many users will sideload the Google Camera APK onto other manufacturer’s phones to utilize it (I’ve done it on my Samsung.) The 3A’s photo performance is no exception – it delivers consistent, high- quality photographs. Its portrait mode is amazing - subjects really pop. I am also a sucker for low-light photography, which can easily be ruined by a flash or graininess. The Pixel 3A’s “Night Sight” mode takes amazing low-light photos. I compared the 3A’s low-like pictures, side-by-side, to my Samsung Note 8 (which has dual cameras vs the 3A’s single camera) and the 3A’s low-light pics were more detailed and sharper despite coming from a single camera.The 3A comes with 4 GB of ram, which is important because many budget phones only ship with two GB. This causes stuttering and performance problems when using memory intensive apps like Snapchat and other social media apps.The 3A also comes with 64 GB on internal storage, but with no ability to add expandable storage via a micro SD card. Google has never been a fan of expandable storage, and for some, that may be a deal-breaker depending on your needs. With the affordability of micro SD, it is certainly convenient to be able to add a 128 GB micro SD card to your phone and gain a massive increase in storage. Depending on your needs, however, 64 GB could be plenty and still represents a decent amount of storage of this price point. My needs typically only exceed 64 GB if I am downloading my entire music library from Spotify, or going on a vacation where I expect to take a lot of photos and video.The 5.6 inch HD screen looks great. It doesn’t have the color saturation of a quad HD screen but it still looks great and has a high PPI.  I suspect most people wouldn’t really perceive much of a difference between this HD screen when compared to a quad-HD. You can also squeeze the sides of the phone to summon Google Assistant, or more usefully, silence an incoming call. This functionality cannot yet be remapped to other functions, but the ability to rapidly silence an incoming call is pretty cool.The 3A does not support wireless charging, nor is it water resistant, which is not surprising given its price. If I had to choose which flagship features to cut to offer a mid-range phone, those are the two I would choose. Thankfully the 3A retains a headphone jack. I use Bluetooth for calls and music on the move, but when I am listening to music at home I prefer the higher audio quality of a wired headset (streamed music is already highly compressed, and Bluetooth further compresses it.)The 3A’s phone back is plastic rather than glass, but I see that as a positive, not a price concession. An expensive glass phone is appreciated for only a few moments until a smart user immediately puts it into a drop-proof case. I am not a fan of super expensive yet highly fragile flagship phones.Being a Google phone, you are guaranteed three years of Android updates. That is great, but there’s a caveat: I have experienced situations where Android updates degraded performance and eventually crippled a phone. Google’s Nexus 6P started off as an amazing phone, but with each Android update, its performance suffered. I suspect that the underpowered processor of the 6P simply could not keep up with the enhanced demands of each new update. The 6P was sold by Google but manufactured by Huawei. This left me with Google telling me to contact Huawei for support (even though I purchased the phone from Google) and Huawei directing me back to Google. I finally gave up the ghost and just purchased a Samsung. I reference this history for this recommendation: purchase an extended warranty with this phone in case you suffer issues 2-3 years down the road that may crop up as your Android version gets updated.Overall, the 3A represents a great value. You get some great flagship phone features at a price well below $500.",1

","July 12, 2019",No,"The Google Pixel 3a goes back to what made the original Google Nexus phones great.  The Pixel 3a may not have the bleeding edge specs of the flagship phones, but at its current price point the Pixel 3a delivers great performance along with the amazing camera that most users can afford.  In our family, we generally upgrade every 2 years but as the prices of phones have kept increasing our ability to keep up the latest and greatest has waned.  It's nice to see that Google finally provided a feature rich device that delivers on what most users want.  One of the reasons we now have 3 pixel 3a phones in our family is because of the guaranteed 3 years of updates.  Having owned competing brands with amazing specs we were quickly disappointed with updates that were long promised but delivered months behind other android pure devices.  Considering how older android operating systems are being targeting now, its nice to know that we have the most up to date secure operating systems available.  The next selling point has to be the class leading 12.2 megapixel rear camera which is the same one as in the original flagship Pixel 3.  It has class leading performance in low light settings and often ranked first in comparison to other camera phones.  The other specs are nominal in comparison to competing brands but in hand its such a nice sleek product.  Pages flow and open quickly without much lag even with slower snapdragon 670 processor, but I'm sure having 4gb of ram definitely helps.  64gb of storage, head phone jack, 3000mah battery, and a beautiful Oled screen makes it feel like a much more expensive handset.  The phones may not have wireless charging or a premium metal case but for most users those don't have much impact on the user experience.  Most users like myself buy a nice phone case and glass screen protector immediately so have a cheaper outer shell isn't a deal breaker.  Overall, there are not too many real competitors in this space at this price point unless its an older model flagship.  Take my money already Google.  5 stars",1

Overall though a step up from your under $200 phone cameras. If you are a photo enthusiast then this is a good feature.The screen quality is amazing. So much depth of color a detail. Lower priced phone screens tend to have less detail and are have too much contrast. They lose detail in the highlights and shadows. But high resolution video looks amazing. So if you watch a lot of movies or video this is a big plus. But if you don't I'm not sure if this is worth the extra cost.The Pixel 3a is made of a glossy plastic. I prefer this over glass and metal constructed phones. The Pixel 3a is lighter in weight which is a priority for me. This phone is narrower than the Moto X4. This is helpful for those who like to hold and text with one hand for example. But I prefer the Moto X4's wider screen. This has a headphone jack which could be useful. It cannot charge wirelessly which is a negative. Battery life is decent, but the Moto X4's is excellent.So this phone is well suited for people who like taking photos and watching video on their phone. A great set of features if you don't want to spend $1,000 on a phone. If you are only using the phone for talking/texting and using utility apps like maps, then I don't think the Pixel 3a is necessary, and a $100-$200 is fine.",1

Also create widgets that when you press on them dial the number that is programmed with that particular widget.2. I could find no detailed manual that describes many of the capabilities and how to set them up.3. There is no way to set up the phone to answer automatically after a particular number of rings. You have to physically touch the phone to answer. For those of us who wear Bluetooth headsets, and especially hearing aids with Bluetooth, this is a great feature. I just discovered that I can take calls by simply pressing on the Bluetooth.4. There does not seem to be any way to adjust the sensitivity when touching the screen.

5.0,"Great phone. Excellent camera and screen
  
","July 18, 2019",No,"I have never spent a lot of money on the newest phone--in fact this phone is by far the nicest and newest phone I have ever had. (I am the type to buy a refurbished iPhone 5 when the newest model is an iPhone 8). That said, I think this phone is great. I've use this with Google Fi, so I haven't had to use a SIM card, though it does have a slot for a SIM so you can use it with any plan (or if you want to use it overseas but don't want to use Google Fi.)I'll list my favorite features below.Best things about this phone:1. It's very lightweight and thin, though it has a nice large screen with great video quality and bright clear colors.2. The camera is great. So much better than the camera on my Samsung Galaxy J5 Prime. It has motion capture so when taking pictures of moving things (like my 3 year old) you can select the best shot out of a sliver of video. It seems to me that this helps prevent blurry photos which have been a chronic issue of mine with other phone based cameras.3. It charges quickly. I am constantly on my phone putzing around when I am bored so the battery depletes relatively quickly (it will last about 24 hours or so with pretty heavy use--no video streaming, but surfing the web, playing games, etc.) happily it charges very quickly. I assume it's the USB-C port that does this as other electronics that use USB-C also seem to charge faster. Still, it only take 30 minutes to an hour to fully charge the phone when the battery is almost dead.4. There is good responsiveness in the touch screen. It is very easy to navigate. I never find myself stabbing the screen with my finger in frustration.5. It is very easy to transfer files, messages, etc. from an old phone to the Pixel (and it comes with an adapter to facilitate this.) I could even move my text messages from my old phone to my new one.6. There is a good amount of storage included--64 GB.7. The sound quality from the speaker is good (nice bass) and can get very loud. If I am streaming music in one room at full volume, I can hear it well several rooms away.Things I wish were a little different:1. There is no slot for a micro-SD card. While storage is plentiful, I would like to be able to expand it if I want. Especially if I didn't want to use google photos.2. The placement of the fingerprint scan on the back (as opposed to on the front) took a bit of getting used to.3. I wish there was a better way to organize the apps. They are all in a single screen and can be hard to find a specific app.Overall, I love this phone. The things I have issue with are really quite small and nit picky. It's a great phone and the price point is not unreasonable. I'm so happy I got this phone. (I really have enjoyed the Google Fi service as well, but that is would be a separate review.)",0

Needless to say, we love our Google phones. Ease of use is the number one reason why we keep coming back to these phones. Google doesn't load their phones up with all kinds of software that you probably won't ever use. They give you the basic stuff, and they make sure its good. The cameras have always been top notch and this 3a is no exception. I was surprised to see how large the 3a was in comparison to our Pixel 3XL. I have included pictures of the phones side by side. The one that is slightly larger on the left is the 3XL. Not a very big difference in my opinion. They each look so similar to one another that it can be hard to tell them apart. I love that the 3a has built in time lapse. a feature google needs to upgrade and include in its software for all their phones. IT HAS A PHONE JACK. This right here was a huge win. It's so easy to include these on phones, yet most makers are straying away from putting them on phones anymore. It's really nice to have to option, especially for a teenager that needs access to earbuds frequently for school. You don't want them always using expensive wireless earbuds, because they can be easily lost. This simple addition makes this a great choice for many.  For the price, you would be hard pressed to find a phone as good as the pixel 3a. I would easily switch over to this phones from my current Pixel 2 if need be.",0

","July 4, 2019",No,"I've been using a refurbished Samsung S5, and it's been limping along with a weak battery and frequent crashes. So I was thrilled to be offered a chance to review this Google Pixel phone. This one was on my shortlist of options when I was ready to upgrade because it had very good reviews, and it seemed like the best mid-range cellphone out there.I have been very pleased with how it has performed. Setting it up was a breeze. It came with a cable that allowed me to transfer my data (including phone contacts) from the Samsung to this one. The instructions are very simple because it's very easy to set up. In fact, this has been the easiest phone to set up of any phone I've ever owned.To complicate things, I was also in the process of changing service providers, so I was nervous that I would have some problems with that. But no. Everything went smoothly with the new provider.Compared to the Samsung S5, the battery capability is 100% better. It holds a charge very well, and when I do charge it, it takes very little time.I'm still exploring the features, but so far I've enjoyed using the camera. It's easy, and the quality far surpasses my previous Samsung. The colors are rich and vivid.I've used Google apps and programs in the past and am quite happy to have a phone that flawlessly works with them.

I could do a detailed comparison of specs and materials between the two, but wanted to focus on my wife's experience with it.  She's been an iPhone user for years and after dealing with some of the normal GUI issues when switching, she says it's much easier to navigate.  Switching over all her data, photos, apps, etc was easy and took very little time when she was able to sit down and use the manual provided.The only negatives in comparison to the XL are a smaller screen (in her case that's a positive actually) and worse battery life.  Her phone still can go for more than a day without needing charging and she uses it quite often.  The cameras on the 3a are the same as the ones on my XL and the quality appears to be equal - for those that don't know, the Pixel's cameras are among the best out there for cellphones.Google cloud storage is free and unlimited, and she's loving that feature.

","December 10, 2019",No,"So this phone is poorly designed to be used as a phone.  The sensor that turns off the touch screen is still in the top left hand corner, so if you are right handed with anything less than a flat face the phone will not turn the screen black while you are talking on the phone and you will find yourself muting yourself or putting people on speaker while on the phone.  Furthermore most controls are sill set up for smaller phones with the back controls in the top left hand corner or bottom left which is not convenient for a right handed person unless you plan on using two hands at all time.  Also the squeeze function only happens when you are trying to hold the phone by the base in portrait mode and stops whatever video you have playing.

Video quality is tack sharp on the main camera.I'm not too concerned about it not having 4k 60fps mainly because I just use 30fps anyway but in the next model like the Pixel4a I would at least like the option available to me.One thing I have to note is the charging speed.
