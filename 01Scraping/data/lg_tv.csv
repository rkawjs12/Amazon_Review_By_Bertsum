","June 25, 2018",Yes,"Picture quality is good, even from the sides.  Sound is not bad for a small TV.  I would not buy it again because of 2 things, which may or may not be important to you: 1) The coax and HDMI inputs face directly backwards and are not recessed.  No big deal if you use the stand, but if you wall-mount this TV the inputs are useless unless you buy L-shaped adapters.  And 2) it has a giant ""wall wart"" power supply instead of a regular power cord.  Way too big to hide/conceal behind a wall-mount bracket.7/10/2018 - Discovered another negative in addition to all the above.

Those that need more bells and whistles should opt for the 24 inch smart TV version for just $122.This TV sits in my kitchen and is hooked up to a NoCable30 antenna sold here for $21.99 and is outstanding. The TV has a tuner that locked in 61 channels which include all local broadcasts. That's way more channels than I need in my kitchen and very impressive.What you will get out of this TV is an outstanding picture, great color and excellent audio up to the max setting. It is plenty loud well below the max. It has all the usual picture and sound settings you would expect and is easy to program. In fact, I never needed to look at the user guide.For me, I just wanted a respected brand that knows how to deliver outstanding performance in a small basic TV for use in my kitchen. This set definitely checked all the boxes.Remember you are getting 1080p detail which while not an expected or necessary upgrade does indeed provide notably sharper detail and an IPS screen which is the most expensive and desirable material for viewing.I hesitated doing this review because of the rather dramatic increase in price but given the issues that are reported with the few other available 22 inch TV brand choices, sharing my experience made sense and the price may come down again.Update :  Just noticed the price drop to $99.99.  Think of what you are getting for a crazy low price. That's $15 less than I paid recently and $37 less than the evn more recent price I noted above. A basic TV but you get LG quality, 1080p sharpness, and IPS screen.  Great picture performance at moderate vision angles to this TV is a huge positive. For me , the perfect kitchen TV.

I then found another post that explained why.  There are different types of HDMI  (internally.  The ""plug"" is the same).  Something called CEC is not available on this low level LG model.  So the TV can not accept the pairing to the Roku Remote.  I returned the TV.  It is 2019.

Zoom just cuts off the words. And it doesn't zoom all the way. There's always a black space at the bottom. The 4.3 mode is ridiculous. It puts the picture in a little box surrounded by black on all sides. I'm really disappointed in that and the blurry picture. It;s not really a deep black. It's more of a sepia shade. No matter what setting. The manual is useless for understanding the settings. LG makes lousy noisy air conditioners and dull televisions. I'm not buying their products anymore. I like the old days televisions where you can adjust the contrast and brightness with the turn of a button. For zooming the picture they should have a setting where you can make the picture fit evenly on the screen. There's a black border on the bottom for the zoom setting. Skin tones are dull and green.

I think it was the best choice for my budget and the useage. Happy buyer.,1

I turned off the voice thing, let the auto channel thing do its stuff, but most importantly remembered to press the input button ( on the remote) clicking on hdmi . It won't work if you have cable and don't do this ( input button). Turned tv and cable box on and poof had a working tv in under 5 minutes.",2

My only issue with it was that it failed after about 8 months; it would show it was plugged in but wouldn't turn on.I requested a warranty repair and although it took a full month for LG to actually send the shipping label and then repair the thing, it now works fine again.  So that was good.  But I do wonder how long it will last before it breaks again.

No USB although manual indicates that limited USB is available on the 28"" model. Picture is great and tuner does its job just fine.

Only wish there was a separate ""screen off"" button on the remote instead of having to drill down through the menu.  We replaced a very old LG about same size the suffered from the bad capacitor fate.  The IPS screen is also a big improvement.  We have the tv mounted at about 5 feet from the floor on top of a bookcase and you can see the screen fine without having to angle it downward to face the bed.

I can't stand that all small TVs are made by companies that produce absolute junk. Destiny is not top of the line by any means oh, it's not even smart. However, it has a good picture, decent contrast, and exceptional color representation. By far the best feature is clear voice filter.

We have ours on the desktop along side a computer monitor and it's perfect for close viewing (2 - 3 ft). In my opinion, the downsides of this TV are weak audio and lack of program description information. Our larger Samsung digital TV displays a synopsis of program content provided by the TV station whereas the LG does not. Fortunately, as we have a nearby computer, we can open a window of TV listings, but I was disappointed that LG did not provide this program content feature.  The weak audio might have also been an issue for use in another room, but I mostly use the TV in caption mode with the audio off so less of an issue in our computer room.",0

It's kind of like I would expect if you went to a toy store and bought a kids ""my first remote""  Its uncomfortable and the buttons require major mashing to work.  Because I use it with my streamer the only thing I use the remote for is the volume, but even that is annoying. You have great little TV here LG!  Just make a better remote and you'll be a super (5) star. Pros: Picture quality, viewable size, small footprint, sensible power adapter/source, good sound for this size unit, doesn't force unwanted smart apps on you. Cons- the remote. It's terrible.Arrived on time, easy to unbox and set up.

The display is missing the high contrast of the Samsung 19"" that sits next to it, and the over-the-air antenna receiver input filters are not sharp enough to suppress interference from public service band transmitters when they are close and as a result I get video dropouts (on both the LG and the Samsung - so I presume they use the same chip without any additional filtering).  On two occasions it has turned on with no sound, only to recover it a day or two later (the Samsung had sound).  There is an uncontrollably noisy chime that sounds when power is turned on or off (I presume this is to assure that mom and dad know when the kids turn it on (or off) in the middle of the night).

At first when I played Dark Souls I thought it looked nice, from my 720p TV this definitely seemed like it was crisper. I noticed colors seemed off but I figured it was just that my mind wasn't used to the better image yet. But then I tried another game FFXIV and the flaws were very apparent. Something that is supposed to be popping bright blue instead just looked flat, this wasn't an issue of brightness or sharpness I tried both. This TV is just bad. My lower quality TV looks better so here's my suggestion. If you're not that worried about quality, you can buy a cheaper TV that at least doesn't lie to you. If you are worried about quality, buy a TV that isn't from LG. This is disgusting.",2

Once that was done, the LG channel selector became the primary ""tool"" for set up. Pluses &amp; Minuses: once you know what buttons control which picture refinements (Sharness, tint, color, etc.), I discovered that adjustment of one could affect another: e.g., changing Color affected Tint, Brightness did so for many  others to a lesser degree level, black level caused a stronger impact universally.  The ""trick"" was find to use screen subject that hadn't be created by man: for example, there was no way to determine what the correct color, tint, brightness, black level, etc. were at all correct in any commercials since there was no ""target"" to try to match.  I found that using a golf match and a baseball daytime game permitted adjustment of color, tint, black level, brightness, sharpness led to a good starting point.  When I'd first turned on the set, the contrast, tint, color and black level  actually caused eye strain - to the point where I turned off the set.
