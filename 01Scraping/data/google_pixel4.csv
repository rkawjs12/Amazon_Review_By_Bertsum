3.0,"Pixel4 - On The Fence With This One - Google Has Cut One too Many Corners Here
  
","October 24, 2019",Yes,"Have been using Android over 10 years and carrying Pixels the last 4 years. Love stock Android. I don't usually buy phones at launch, but I caved this year. Don't care about the camera, but if this is important for you, look no further. Like it's predecessors, this phone takes nice photos. Cool design, premium feel, and a modestly updated feature set. Android is still Android after all. The phone does feel good in your hand. Screen is very nice and the 90hz refresh is noticeably smooth. If you've been reading reviews, you've probably read all this elsewhere.I do want to like this phone and am going to give it a chance, but I'm going to be merciless if the device doesn't stand up to reasonable everyday use. What do I mean by this? We bought two phones but I've only opened one of them to evaluate. Set up was easy. Connect your devices and less than 10 min later, everything was transferred. Apps installed, then they updated. Ready for testing. WiFi and Bluetooth connection were fast and solid.One thing I was quite impressed with was the sound. After using earlier pixels with front firing speakers I was a little worried. Nothing to worry about here. Sound quality is very good (full and rich), and the gesture navigation skip forward and back worked for me as well, boom!  4K videos looked good and so did ones shot in 1080p.Face unlock. This was another ""on the fence"" item for me. Cool feature and it works, but now they have it all. Our fingerprints from the last generation of phones can now be linked with our faces. Works perfectly in pitch black darkness.  Infrared wins.I still have the same (major) concerns as others. The 2800mah battery is tiny. I am extremely skeptical here, but hope I can be proven wrong. No unlimited original res photo storage. I know Google is in business to make money, but what a chump thing to do. It's right up there with them not including a headphone adapter or headphones this time around. So this is the price you pay or accessories you forego to have the latest tech. I believe this could have been done better or differently. It's a flagship phone, or at least that's what Google is calling it. Congrats Google, you've cut just about every corner you possibly could with this device.What's next. Let's see how the device performs in real day-to-day usage. In the car, in a pocket with Bluetooth and the normal stuff we all do with our devices. The TINY subpar battery had better be good. Otherwise 2 of these phones are coming right back to you.My suggestion, if you didn't jump on the launch deal is WAIT. The phone is nice, but the potential for disappointment is there. Black Friday and Christmas are just around the corner too.***Update Daily useCall and audio quality is good, using a BT headset also good. Streaming music to the cars audio system working well. Android 10 has a few quirks, but is working and very stable.  I haven't had any performance issues with the device or its OS.  Although I had WiFi calling on my 3XL (AT&amp;T) , it will not activate on this device. May I have to call them to see why.***Update after 3 weeks of ownershipWhile I am fully sold on the Face Unlock feature, I still miss the finger print reader.  Its just something you become used to after years of pixel ownership.  I've only caught myself trying to unlock the phone about 3 times with my finger.  I set up face unlock without glasses, but it works when I put on reading glasses, and also while wearing sun glasses (that one is amazing).  One thing people and (google) haven't thought of.  Currently, Face Unlock works even your eyes are closed.  Google has said they are going to release an update that addresses this.  Ok, so what happens when I'm wearing sunglasses?Trusted Devices or Places will probably address this.  My phone stays unlocked in the car and at home or work.  But if you are outside walking around and wearing sun glasses, you might have to PIN into the device or lift your sunglasses.  This is still an unknown I guess.I called AT&amp;T and we determined the IMEI of the phone was not ""whitelisted"" on their network.  Hence the reason why I couldn't activate Wi-Fi calling.  It took them 3 days, but they re-provisioned the SIM (remotely) and added the ID.  Wi-Fi Calling works now.  If you have this problem with a new phone (any brand) that is compatible with voLTE and Wi-Fi calling, but was not purchased through your carrier (subsidy) there is always a possibility that the phone will not be ""whitelisted"".  You have to call customer care and be really nice.  I got lucky the first time I called, sometimes it takes more than one call.  The second device (other P4) which is also with AT&amp;T (but a different plan) will not allow Wi-Fi to be activated either, so this means another call to the carrier.  Hand off between Cellular and Wi-Fi or vice versa works 98% of the time.  I've had a few dropped calls say when I'm walking into work or the house and the phone transitions from Cellular to Wi-Fi.  Mostly however, it works and is stable.  For those who have had Google Fi, you'll know exactly what I am talking about.  Wi-Fi calling capable devices attempt to switch aggressively whenever they can move voice calls to Wi-Fi.The new Google Assistant is very good.  The AI they have built into the core of the OS is impressive.  Not needing a cellular or Wi-Fi connection to use it makes it extremely fast.  For me, this is probably the most notable upgrade from a Android/hardware perspective.BIGGEST concern &gt;&gt; the 2800mah battery.  Remarkably, the phone lasts all day and well into the next morning without being charged.  I had concerns about going to sleep with a low battery and having the phone die during the night and then no alarm in the morning.  Well, it hasn't been a problem.  I typically have 17-30% percent remaining in the morning and can easily throw the phone on charge before leaving the house.  I have the ""always on"" display turned on, and allow all notifications to display on my lock screen.  I have gesture navigation enabled which keeps the soli radar chip active and looking for gestures above the device when its stationary.  I stream videos and play music over Bluetooth in the car.  I also use navigation when walking frequently.  Normal use and the battery has held up well.  This is really a matter of personal preference and your usage.  Initial reviews said 3-4 hrs of screen time should be expected.  I'm getting 5-6hrs.  If you are on your phone for hours a day, or play games, get the XL.In closing, I have found myself &gt;&gt;inconvenienced&lt;&lt; more than once since the phone did not come with a USB-C to 3.5mm headphone adapter.  I have headphones, but have been left to work one handed because I don't have my BT headset with me.  Google &gt; BIGGEST CHUMP MOVE EVER.  Really pissed me off.  I've ordered one.  Tired of the inconvenience.With that said, my original recommendation stands.  If you cannot buy the P4 or XL at a serious discount, WAIT.  It is not worth the full retail price, regardless of the new ""features"".  Its over priced for what you get, and Google has cut way too many corners seriously detracting from the value you receive vs. cost of the device at full price.  Still 64GB of storage, small 2800mah battery, no adapters, no headphones, no unlimited full res photo storage..  Other people have said this too.  Google has had several chances to build and release good devices.  They just can't get it right.  You pay for a flagship and there is always a compromise.  In the case of the P4, its one after another.***Final Update 6 weeks of ownership.I am enjoying the phone and it's working as I intended.  I had Android 10 on my 3XL so no surprises there.  As usual Google continues to improve and refine it's OS.  Everything just works.  This is why I buy Pixels.While I like the phone, this years Pixels did not wow me like those of previous years.  It's a phone, it's running the latest version of Android but that's about it.The new AI built into the Google Assistant remains the most noteable ""feature"" from an upgrade perspective for me. But like before, that's it.  The premium price tag is just disproportional to the value you are receiving.I am a fan of Android, but this year Apple and OnePlus nailed it from a hardware perspective.  Cost to value ratio.  They came through where you (Google) failed. The P4 isn't even 2 months old and most carriers are practically giving them away.  Not to mention Google has substantially increased trade in values for older devices to entice new buyers.Which leads me to ask..  Google are you giving up on Pixel?  Does this mean Samsung and OnePlus devices for everyone next year.  Man you guys got some black eyes this year.  All avoidable too.I can say this.  Nice phone, but I won't buy your device at launch next year.  Everyone, I urge you to heed these words.  Do not pay full price for this device.  I'm not saying don't buy it, but don't buy it at full price.",492
1.0,"Save your money.
  
","November 6, 2019",Yes,"The phone is flimsy, under-engineered and not worth the high cost. There are no longer any deals regarding Google cloud storage. Google is only offering three years support for this phone, then they pull the plug. The battery life is a joke. The operating system needs fixes to be secure, especially critical face recognition. I can not imagine why anyone would spend so much for so little. I returned the two that I originally ordered.",135
3.0,"After 3 days... This is going back
  
","October 26, 2019",No,"Very poor battery life- expect about half a work day with moderate usage.  Love the gestures feature, super loud speakers, and great camera, but the pixel 4 is just too wimpy. Also surprised at how small it is, since the screen is ""bigger"" than my last phone. The 16:9 aspect ratio makes the phone significantly narrower, which is a big issue for keyboard use when typing anything and holding the phone vertical. Going to try the 4xl and see how that works.",76
4.0,"Pixel 4 XL vs Samsung Note 10?
  
","October 30, 2019",No,"So I was lucky enough to use both phones for a while and here are my thoughts :Display:The thing you use the most really on any phone now is the screen, the note 10 has an amazing screen &amp; I never expected any phone to have better screen to look at. Well, the Google Pixel did just that! I dunno if it's the cleaner software or what, but the Pixel's screen does feel a little nicer.Camera:While the Pixel should have been the clear winner here, it really isn't! Yes, the front selfie camera, at night or indoor is definitely better, but honestly it feels worse than last year's Pixel 3 for some reason. The selfies feel a little fake, and the camera angles are weird. The back camera however isn't much better than the Note, in fact I find myself missing the wide angle camera that I had on my Note, a lot!On a side note, my wife's iPhone 11 pro back camera also feels a little better than the Pixel's, which is also unexpectedHalf star off really, not for a bad camera, but for the disappointment, it's just not as good as expected.Software:No need to bother comparing here, the Google software is much better, cleaner, smoother &amp; more productive than that of Samsung, hands down the Pixel OS wins here.Battery:Not that much of a difference, the Note 10 does tend to last longer. Both aren't that great though but the Note will give you, may be, a couple more extra hours, which is appreciated really!Design:The Note 10 is beautiful! Very slick, all screen display, nice curvy sides, while the pixel does look good overall, specially the back, but the front design is ugly, and I don't care if they have a radar on the front, it really doesn't seem to be that much more functional and I would rather have the fingerprint scanner with an all edge to edge display, thinner phone, than the secure face ID with a big top hinge. Another half star off for a lazy design.The face ID itself is worth mentioning, it's surprisingly accurate and fast, but so many apps don't support it yet and having to enter passwords for banks &amp; stuff seems like something that we had left behind, but with the lack of fingerprint and the lack of face id support on so many Android app, there really are no other options, try not to forget those passwords, you'll be in trouble!Overall, I think I'll be keeping my Pixel for a little while longer but I can't say I'm fully happy with it really.",69
1.0,"Waste of money
  
","October 22, 2019",Yes,Just avoid the black phone. It is fingerprint magnet. Screen quality of the phone is not good. My pixel XL or pixel 2 XL is far far better. I am Google fan. So bought the phone on 1st day. Now I have to continue with the phone for next 1 year untill they release Pixel 5 XL. Only improvement is camera quality. I am not sure why YouTube reviewers are saying that screen quality is good or Phone is good. I don't see any reason to buy this phone.,39

1.0,"At $399 this phone would still be overpriced
  
","December 3, 2019",Yes,"I had been waiting for this phone ever since details were leaked just before summer. Then the specs were leaked - 6gb OK fair enough. 90hz screen fantastic. 2 camera lenses ok maybe. Snapdragon 855 instead of 855 plus bit disappointing but not enough to stop the purchase.Then they release the pricing - same ballpark as the iphone. OK sure it's a google phone, probably has the same quality as the iphone right?No, wrong. It feels cheap compared to an iphone, it looks cheap compared to an iphone. The ridiculous uncentered screen is dim compared to an iphone. Honestly this phone looks like a 2017 model year phone, not 2019. But then again it's made by HTC which should tell you everything you need to know right there.The spec is a joke, 64gb storage, no free google photo uploads - they are trying to be apple without providing the excellent hardware.Android 10 is great but STILL it has stuttering scrolling even with a 90hz screen. Anyone who says different is kidding themselves, IOS scrolls liquid smooth without resorting to a 90hz refresh rate.The whole radar chip gesture navigation is a total gimmick waste of hardware and resources and screen real estate. No one is going to use it in its current iteration.Android 10 telephony support is inferior to IOS - you can make whatsapp calls from favorites in IOS dialer - not an option in Android 10.Android 10 updates SUCK, even with pixel, the company phone you are only guaranteed 3 years of updates while apple gives you 5.It's SO OVERPRICED I cannot believe google have the cheek to sell this phone at this price bracket. No edge to edge screen, awful battery life, paltry storage.Do yourself a favour and skip the pixel 4.",24
5.0,"5 stars, but the jury is still out
  
","November 27, 2019",Yes,"So far after just a week I am going to stay with 5 stars.  If that changes I will update the review.  Its not perfect, but overall the good outweighs the bad.  So here are my notes.Its the only Android I would consider because of security and Google updates.  I would only ever buy an unlocked Apple or a Google phone - where the software vendor pushes the updates every month.  Otherwise I'm not interested.  If you buy another Android phone good luck getting major OS upgrades or even security patches.First, all the nitpicks about battery life: Yeah, its a small phone.  Its not like Google put in a small battery just to mess with you.  So far, it seems about the same as my Pixel 3 to me: just ok.  Unless you work mostly in the wilderness its not really an issue just top off during the day occasionally. (I hike a lot in the wilderness, and I carry a battery pack for those times).  So if you need guaranteed all day battery life buy the XL.OK that aside, its a bit faster than my Pixel 3.  I noticed one web page in particular that is grossly javascript heavy would load very slowly on my pixel 3 and is much faster on my 4.I’m not a huge fan of the face unlock so far.  The old fingerprint reader worked better for me most of the time – you could unlock it as you picked it up.  Now I have to wait till I look at it.  But I got over that.  Its not bad either, and occasionally its better – Lastpass for example, unlocks itself.And heh, lets get real about the flaw that you can have your eyes closed.  They plan to fix this, and its really not much less secure than a fingerprint as is.  If you are sleeping or dead either one can be bypassed,.The size if just right I don’t want a giant phone.Likewise gestures took a bit of practice.  I hate Iphones because of the no back button problem; now I don’t have one either.  There is a swipe gesture instead, but its a little slower and less reliable than the old way.  Still, I am resisting the temptation to enable the back button so far.The dual sim capability is amazing!  I keep a Google Fi eSim onboard with Visible (Verizon MVNO) as my main carrier.  The Pixel 4 does a dramatically better job of managing dual sims and either number rings now.Most of all I appreciate the Google commitment to privacy and security.  (I could care less how many times they market my web history to advertisers, it doesn’t compromise my security.)I am disappointed I no longer get free full resolution camera uploads but can live with the free high resolution.And really, no earbuds included?  Although I am very happy not to have the antiquated headphone jack and I have the google earbuds leftover from previous pixels which are great.I appreciate Amazon having the black Friday sale price of $599 and an extended return period in case it dies!So this phone is a keeper for me.  I’ve had almost every Google phone ever made going back to day 1, and they just get a bit better with each iteration.",23
5.0,"Excellent phone overall, great user expirience,  a little dissapointing in some areas of the phone.
  
","November 17, 2019",Yes,"Great screen, love the 90hz refresh rate.Camera is astounding, Night Sight is great, Astrophoto is excellent.Face unlock is quick, but wish there was also a fingerprint sensor for added security.64gb is enough for me as I have Google 1 subscription so I don't really have problem with storage for photos, for $20 the 100gb a year is better than forking out additional $100 for an extra 64GB worth of storage in my opinion.Wish the battery could have been a little bit bigger, but overall expirience is great as expected from a pixel phone silky smooth UI and great software optimization.I came from a Pixel 2 moving to Pixel 4 XL, I also own a LG V50.There's a certain pixel expirience that you don't get on other android smartphone that makes me comeback to pixel despite its negative criticism it recieves from other reviewers, you can give it a shot probably buy when it has discounts over its price.",17
3.0,"Acceptable for my use cases, but decidedly underengineered phone.
  
","November 8, 2019",Yes,"The device is adequate and satisfies my desire for minimal bloatware (beyond the grotesque bloating of 'wares that Google has made, such as inserting advertisments in Google Maps, Photos, etc).  Battery is sufficient for someone with ready access to an electrical outlet of some kind for most of the day who does not watch shows or surf the Internet on the device.I don't regret upgrading from the original Pixel (2016) to this model as it is a clear upgrade from what I had, but it's not a good one.",15

4.0,"Really cool phone if you give it a chance; another jump in tech for Google
  
","November 17, 2019",Yes,"Professional reviews for phones are usually the best resource. However, that said, I think I should offer another perspective that isn't nearly as negative. In general, I think the reviewers were too harsh. Some of them even had me on the brink of canceling my order. Glad I didn't.I have the 64GB XL.Battery life - I am not seeing much difference from my Pixel 3. The horrible battery life mentioned in some reviews is not my experience. I consider myself an average smartphone user. I'm not a 16 year old on social media all day and I don't play games. I use it all day at work (email, text, in car for music, reading some blogs with videos, the occasional call) and a little at night. When I get home, I have over 50% left. I keep the always-on display on, I use motion sense, all the connection methods are on. The key here is that I don't see a big difference from my past phones.Also - you have to give the Android OS time to use its adaptive battery function to manage various aspects of the phone. It learns your usage patterns and adjusts. This results in better battery life. I saw many reviews where the author didn't give it time.HD Calling on AT&amp;T - I bought this unlocked model on Amazon and when I swapped my SIM out, HD calling works normally. There might be an issue with corporate accounts but search the web and look at what some people did to circumvent it. This is an AT&amp;T issue, not Google's.Motion Sense - no, it doesn't have a lot of active functionality yet, only track skipping and alarm snoozing (which is AWESOME). What many reviews fail to highlight enough is that it augments the face unlock feature by bringing your phone to attention when you reach for it. It also allows you to turn off the always-on display then have it wake only when you are near the phone.New assistant - pretty cool. Many of the basic requests are now handled on the phone, not requiring contact with Google servers. It really speeds things up.As of Nov 1, it does have little things that I hope Google works out. Face Unlock needs to be updated to prevent unlocks when your eyes are closed. It would be nice if Smooth Display (90Hz) worked more often - although, I think the display is awesome as is, it can only get better. Google is planning to fix those. More apps need to support face unlock and that's a total wildcard; depends on the app. LastPass supports it so that's sort of a gateway to your other apps.*UPDATE 11/19/19** Smooth Display (90Hz) has been corrected with the November security update. An already beautiful screen is even better now! Also - LastPass now supports Face Unlock.Finally, you can't deny this is an expensive phone. I got it for, basically, $100 off and that brought it closer to an acceptable price for me. But - it's a personal decision. You'll have to weigh the value and decide if it works for you.If you are considering this phone, I'll be honest, also consider the Pixel 3XL (or Pixel 3). Many of the new features on the 4 will make it to the 3. If you don't need to be on the cutting edge or the extra camera features, the 3/3XL is a great phone! However, you won't be disappointed by the 4XL. After a week of getting used to face unlock and the gestures, I really like this phone.NOTE ON MEMORY - My last two phones were 64GB. Prior to that, I bought 128GB. With my past two phones, I never ran out of space with 64GB. I keep several large music playlists downloaded, I upload all my images to Google Photos and delete them from my phone.Photos: No case. In a cloth case, you can hide the color for the most part if you want.",11

Camera is definitely amazing and I can say that it takes good pictures everytime in all scenarios. What I didn't expect to be good in this phone was battery life but this phone actually has pretty good battery life. On average it's lasting 6 hours of screen on time as I watch Youtube videos on my free time and still managed to give me sufficient more battery. Lastly, this phone is really snappy and smooth. Like damn! Reeeeeally quick app opening and everything, you will love the 90Hz screen as you use it.",13

The price is worth it for selfies as it has a portrait mode that blurs background! taking beautiful scenic views even from afar is a breeze and results are breathtaking! And the Night mode feature!! Im in love with it as you dont need to be a pro to take amazing night and light shots! Speakers are with high quality and bass! Transcribe feature works good. Screen resolution is beautiful. CONS: motion sensor(soli) is not supported in in my country (APAC region). Face unlock is a bit tricky to setup to make it work properly. Overall..you will love owning this android phone more than any other! The price is a bit expensive and it should be $699 only without adding the $100 amazon gift card as the total was at $799.,12

","November 21, 2019",Yes,"The one feature I wanted in my new phone was to be able to use it in desktop mode with an external USB-C monitor. I had heard that the ability to do this was built into Android 10, but astoundingly, Google didn't build this into their flagship phones. The use of the phone as a phone was just fine but not significantly better than my OnePlus 6t, so I put it back in the box 3 hours after I opened it and sent the phone back. There was nothing truly groundbreaking about it. Our phones are more powerful than many people's laptops. I should be able to use my phone as the engine behind a screen to access desktop versions of websites and watch movies while streaming directly from my phone. Seems pretty simple to me.",9
4.0,"Perfection was so close, but I guess there is always next year.
  
","October 24, 2019",Yes,"Leaks and early reviews made people know what was coming and the few details we were missing were a disappointment. Google justifies that a telephoto it's more useful than an ultra wide but when you are joining the big league of flagships you give customers the options that the market offers and in this case I think that the wide angle omission was a big miss. This and the surprise of a smaller battery compared to last year's pixel are the drawbacks that I wanted to get out of the way first.The battery is not great as people expected and on my two day use, I have had around 4 hours of screen on time. I feel like this is making a big favor to goole, and in no way this is a justification, but my smaller battery has made me rethink that probably being on my phone for 4 hours and being stressed about it is probably something I could improve and adjust on my personal time management. Normal phone use with camera use every once in a while is achievable for sure with the regular pixel 4. For me the trade-off of a smaller battery but a more manageable body compared to the XL is worth it.To combat the lack of wide angle, I luckily had a moment wide angle lens I used on my pixel 2 that I did not get rid off when I got my S10e. I can confidently say the convenience of having the lens on the phone is great, but in case of the Samsung lens the quality dropped from the main lens to the wide angle and using the awesome lens from moment doesn't decrease the quality or adds any distortion to the main lens. Having moment announce the support of the Pixel 4 gives me a wide angle and basically convert my two lens to the ideal 3 lens scenario we all wanted. I seriously recommend the products and content Moment has to anyone interested in photography.Now for the good stuff, Pixel 4 shines in what I expected and made me come back for a pixel. I went from Nexus 6p- Samsung s8 and Pixel 2 - Samsung s10 and both times I kept missing my Google phone. If rellying on a camera that will ALWAYS deliver a great photo is something you value, I don't think there is a better option than Pixel. It's more difficult to take a bad photo than it is to take GREAT one. The lack of original quality cloud backup is a bit sour, but you can still back them on a good enough quality, considering most people just like to go back and see their photos on their phones and not for a big print out where amazing quality is required. The price of Google one is also reasonable and gives enough space for original quality backup.Lastly, the screen and 90hz screen are the cherry on top of this cake. If you use your phone, you need to unlock it so having something that makes this process go this smooth because of the early waking up of the phone  from the radar to scan for your face it's really wonderful. The 90hz helps on another side of our everyday use equation : scrolling CONSTANTLY. The difference is noticeable and it's something I know I will get used to. As with many other things and features, it's one of the little things techlovers appreciate and other consumers just don't care about.There is no perfect phone but Pixel constantly proved for me that there's no match for their camera and having the best Android experience is what you get. With this year's Pixel 4 you get that plus an awesome clean and finally finger print free construction, a superb pair of speakers that do not make me miss the front firing speakers of the Pixel 2 and some nifty features that scratch my geek technology itch.",8
3.0,"Mediocre experience
  
","November 30, 2019",Yes,"There is so much to like about the Pixel 4xl, but so much to loathe, too. I just can't get over the negatives and actually am returning it and going back to my old phone. I watched the rumors on this phone for nearly a year with anticipation and joy. Android 10 is great, and so is the pure Android experience. The camera software is excellent, too, but the lack of ultra-wide angle camera hardware and mediocre battery ended up being bigger drawbacks than I could tolerate in the end. I didn't think it would be a big deal, but after having an ultra-wide camera on my last phone, I have learned really can't go back. I tried. I used to have the Nexus 5 years ago, which was probably one of my favorite, most reliable phones of all time. But this phone just doesn't wow enough to justify the price, when others out there are sadly beating them at the hardware game.  I wanted this phone to do well, but when you have been a Google die-hard since smartphones came out, and you see yourself considering an iPhone 11 Pro, then to me, that's telling. Oh yea, the phone is way more top heavy in the hand than I anticipated, and it feels like it wants to fall out of my hand often, which is also meh.",7
5.0,"The right phone for me
  
","October 25, 2019",Yes,"I spent a few weeks researching phones and ended up going for this one. Did the new release and pre-order deal inform that decision? Certainly. But that wasn't the only factor, and after 2 days, I have no buyer's remorse (yet).The contents of the box are basic - you get a charging cable and a USB port to allow the transfer of data from your old phone, and that's it. No headphones, no dongle, no USB-C to USB cable.The phone is simple, elegant, and light. And that last is not insignificant. Among flagship phones, it's one of the smallest and lightest around, and it fits very neatly in my pocket with minimal bulk. In fact, it's been some time since I had a phone I could comfortably leave in the pocket of my pants while sitting down.The interface is smooth and fast, and while there may be slightly better screens on the more expensive flagship models, it's plenty sharp enough for me. Motion sense it is a bit of a gimmick at this stage - not many app use it yet and it isn't 100% reliable, but it's nice to be able to vaguely waft at my alarm in the morning to snooze it. It just takes less mental energy at a time when my mental energy reserves are at their lowest. It's been reliable enough so far.Another cool new feature is live caption - instant subtitles on any media the phone is playing. I tested this while watching a Thursday Night Football NFL game, and it worked well enough. The feed was a little slow and occassionally struggled with names (Case Keenum was regularly referred to as case kingdom and Stefon Diggs confused it no end, but it got most of the other names right). I often stream football with the volume off and will make good use of this feature.The main event, though, is the camera, and it doesn't disappoint. Yes, there's no wide angle lens, but the basic camera is fairly wide already. If you want full field-of-view that distorts the edges and the verticals, then maybe an iPhone11 is better, but early tests seem to vindicate Pixel's decision to go for 'telephoto' (2x zoom) instead - the zoom is excellent and the portrait mode blows most of the competition out of the water.  Images are sharp, colors are represented well and the software allows you to achieve a finer finish than anyone should really expect from the sort of lens and sensor a phone can carry. The photos added to this review show night sight, 8x zoom on the staute of liberty, and a couple of pictures using portrait mode (my cat, and a macro style photo which might be my favouite so far)Battery life is generally listed as the biggest negative of the Pixel 4, but it's been fine for me. I did reduce the frame refresh rate to 60Hz and put it on dark mode (Makes no real difference to me anyway). With those changes, I was able to do 1 hour web surfing, stream an hour of video, spend 1 hour reading an e-book, plus half and hour taking photos, and half an hour listening to music over bluetooth, and at the end of the day I still had 28% battery left. All around, fairly comfortable. If you're not a high-intensity user and you're happy with dark mode and a normal refresh rate, battery shouldn't be a deal breaker.Overall, I wanted a small, light phone with an excellent camera. Now, I have one.",7

","December 19, 2019",Yes,"I purchased a Google Pixel 3 on March 11, 2019.  Within the first 3 months I noticed freezing when the phone would get hot, mostly when plugged in charging.  As time went on, the problem got worse.  at the 7 month mark, I reached out to Google support and they advised that I would need to take my device to a repair center (ubreakIfix) and pay for any necessary repairs out of pocket.  This was devastating, as I had a OnePlus 1 device for 4-5 years prior to upgrading to the Pixel 3.  Of course, the OnePlus 1 was a $299 phone from an unknown company at the time and it was extremely reliable, still to this day working without issue.  I declined to spend more money on the Pixel 3, but with it being such a great device (when it worked), I decided to purchase a Pixel 4, although I felt wronged by Google's unwillingness to help with a device I purchased just 7 months prior.Now I've got my Pixel 4 and I'm thrilled to have a phone that won't just freeze in the worst situations, like the Pixel 3 did.  The 2nd night, or so, that I had the phone, I went to a family event incredibly excited to try out the camera on this new phone and record some memories.  When I arrived, I tried to open my camera and the app crashed.  I tried again... crash.  I uninstalled and reinstalled and the app was still crashing.  Installed security updated, reinstalled camera--still crashing.  So, here I am at a family event trying my hardest to fix the camera on my phone.  Upon 2nd follow up with Google, I asked that my case be referred to a supervisor.  The representative advised that a supervisor would be in touch within 48 hours.  No one has proactively followed up with me.Now I'm here, having spent over $1200 on cell phones in 8 months, and neither phone is fully functional.  I feel wronged with Google's unwillingness to right the 7-month old freezing issue at their cost, while I feel incredibly disappointed that the 2nd device came with issues right out of the box.  So incredibly disenchanted with Google.",4

","December 19, 2019",Yes,"I'm usually not a picky phone user and as such many of the things other users complain about do not bother me. Eg. battery life is perfectly adequate, bezels do not detract from anything, etc. But the omission of the fingerprint reader is unforgivable. I've used all the previous Pixel XL phones and fingerprint readers has become a mandatory feature. The quick and reliable unlocking of the phone and its use in lieu of passwords for apps are indispensable at this point.While face-unlock is a nice gimmick it is very laggy and not reliable enough. Add to this a lack of integration of face-unlock with third-party apps and we end up with half-baked feature.While I ultimately have nothing against face-unlock, it is in no way a replacement for fingerprint reader. I for one wish Google kept the fingerprint reader in addition to face-unlock and the omission is the cause for me rating the phone so low.",3

It's fun and modern.- Phone feels solid.- camera is out of the world.  This is the best phone camera that I have ever used- Using the phone is super smooth- keyboard feels amazing to use- switching apps on from the bottom slide is awesome.- going back to previous page with a swipe is awesome- printing from phone has been the easiest.  I was never able to print from iPhone. It required AirPrint.- being able to access my files on the phone is an amazing feature- sound on the phone is really good- Google Duo in my opinion is a better product than Facetime- split screen is extremely useful- picture in picture for video is really cool- love the ability to skip songs with a gesture.  Comes very handy at work.- time date and weather showing on phone when not using is a brilliant idea- face recognition is super fast- setting up the phone was super easy- Gboard is a life saverBesides the cons below, I think Google nailed this.Cons- have not been able to get Fitbit 3 HR to connect- no headphone jack. Wished Google did not follow the steps of Apple.- no SD card.  Stop being like Apple and do the right thing by not limiting people and forcing them to use Cloud services.- search feature not as powerful as Apple- no headphone jack.  Once again stop following Apple's crazy marketing ploys.- OTP integration on Apple is better, but I think as the OS matures the feature will eventually be available on Android- my company restricts the use of Gmail so I had to use outlook instead of gmail",2

","December 13, 2019",Yes,"For years with my phones I have always gone with the idea of ""Hardware over software"" because of the fact that software can be changed and updated,  but hardware cannot. As a result, I stuck mainly with Samsung and oneplus phones (most recently the note 9).This year, I finally took the plunge on the Pixel, because I felt like the hardware was finally good enough to just scrape by (more than 4 gigs of ram is nice, 90hz screen is great, and the camera makes me feel like a professional). Its been almost a month, and I don't regret it at all.The experience is wildly better when there is no bloatware or extra stuff to get through. I didn't have to disable a hardware dedicated button to a function I never used, disable apks, and change all the default apps. If you are one that does not value the software experience, though, I feel like there are a lot of other phones that you should get instead. If you cannot get it on sale like I did, then I do not think what you get is worth the price. But now that I have experienced it, I don't know if I can ever go back to other android phones, save for OnePlus, if their cameras ever catch up.",1

","December 12, 2019",Yes,"Love the phone. You get what you would expect from a Pixel, though definitely recommend getting it via a Black Friday deal (got mine for $200 off). Great camera, flexibility, best software, etc... If you are alright with being limited by brand, buy an iPhone. But if you like being able to customize to your liking, stick with Android. The face recognition is very fast, gestures are neat (though don't really find the opportunity to use them), really enjoy my alarm volume decreasing when it knows I'm reaching over to silence early in the morning. I chose the XL because Google did make one big mistake with this generation and that is the battery. I play games and use the phone all day and am at around 40 to 50% when I go to bed, so for me the XL is sufficient but I would assume the smaller version battery would be an issue. All in all, great phone. Buy it when it is discounted, get the XL to avoid battery issues and you'll be happy. One last little con is that Google didn't include headphones. For a flagship phone that costs this much, they could/should have included headphones or at least an adapter given this doesn't, like most new phones, have a headphone jack.",2

","January 9, 2020",Yes,"I have been a loyal pixel user for years, but the Pixel 4 has been a disappointment. The phone itself it's not great. The major problem is the battery life.. I had to recharge it twice per day to get to the end of the day. The face recognition would be ok, if apps would actually support it. But most banking and secure apps do not support it, so I had to type the password each time, instead of using the fingerprint as I used to do in the past.On top of it, the phone I received had major issues with Bluetooth. Google support has been unhelpful.The problem was that the microphone wasn't working on any BT headset I would use, making it impossible to talk on the phone (or Duo, or Skype or anything else) using a BT headset. I complained with Google and they told me it was a known issue and I had to disable Google Assistant while they were working on a solution.I disabled Google Assistant (even though it's one of the major selling points of this 799$ phone which otherwise would not compare to other top shelf phones), and it worked for a while. After a couple of weeks, it stopped working again, even with Google Assistant disabled.I contacted Google and they told me that since I bought the phone on Amazon, I should ask Amazon for a replacement.I asked Amazon, and they said they would do a refund instead, which was fine for me because at that point I preferred a different phone anyways (I got a OnePlus 7T and it's a much better choice overall).After I finally sent the phone back, Amazon refunded me only 420$ instead of the full 699$ saying I sent the phone after the 30 days period they include in the full refund.So, basically, because I bought the phone on Amazon instead of Google, I ended up losing 280$ because of a nonfunctional phone.I would advice against buying the Pixel 4 altogether, but if you want to buy it, don't buy it on Amazon.I have never been tricked more for a purchase of this type.

The phone is fast and smooth.  For setup, I moved my SIM card from my old phone to the Pixel, then connected the Pixel to my old phone via USB and copied everything over.  No need to talk to anyone at Verizon.  Very easy process.  Audio quality is noticeably better.  The camera is excellent.  Battery life is good.  I haven't had any trouble making it through the day.Keep in mind there is no headphone jack.  The wireless charging works well even with a Spigen case on it.The squeeze for Google Assistant feature hasn't been super helpful, but it may just require a change in usage habits.  The same is true for Motion Sense.I haven't dunked it underwater yet, but it should survive for at least 30 minutes at up to 3 ft. deep.

","November 26, 2019",No,"So I'll pretense this with the fact that I probably would have given this phone a solid 3.5-4 star rating out of the gate, but I toughed it out and I'm glad I did.The battery was draining pretty quickly for the cost that that was really doing it in for me; no other features mattered if I couldn't get through the day to use them.But I gave the phone a chance and I'm really glad that I did. This is the best android phone I've had. Prior to this phone I was bouncing back and forth between the Samsung Galaxy S8+ and the iPhone X because I loved the iPhone's size camera but I so longed for android's OS which took heavy launcher modification on the Galaxy S8+.In comes the Pixel 4XL,  which gave me the stock android I'd missed so dearly since my old Nexus 6.After charging through a couple of battery cycles, the battery is usually sitting at 50% at the end of the day, so for me, the phone usually lasts about 1.5 days solid, no questions. Battery is never a problem. Its unfortunate that this phone caught so much flack for battery drain because in my own tests, idk if they did tweaks with updates or if the battery needed to be exercised, but I never have ANY issues anymore with it after charging it up and draining it the first couple of times. Now it lasts all day.The camera is unreal. Although people will be frustrated that it doesn't have two cameras on front and 3 cameras on back (the wide angle cameras), the front camera is already has a very wide FOV, much wider than the iPhone X, which made it an instant upgrade for me, not to mention the quality was much better. The rear cameras are incredibly crisp, and exactly what I enjoy, which is true color. I'm not a fan of Samsung's camera software which tends to over saturate photos natively, so the Pixels camera is provides photos that are just how you see them which is how I like them. The night site works incredibly well which I've tested extensively inside, outside, on the move, and stationary. The video I can't speak to because I haven't tested.The face unlock is absurdly fast almost to a fault, and it does work at angles which the iPhone does not. It is, although, quite annoying that other apps don't work with it yet. I'm hoping that changes soon.I've tried my hand at a lot of different manufacturers over the years in HTC, Samsung, Google, Apple, Motorola, and LG, and so far the Pixel 4 XL has won me over as my favorite to date.",11

This will be a tremendous flop. For having the engineering brain trust that you employ... You've squandered it.Shame on you.",13

","November 7, 2019",No,The irony is TMobile has 55 discount plan which is good so I jumped ship from att . That's the good . Pixel 4 is a mediocre phone at best . The gester for controlling the phone is confusing. thank God Android 10 has ability to reinstate 3 buttion control or phone would been returned. My biggest gripe is taking away fingerprint scanner this makes it almost impossible to unlock with one hand .you have to use a password manger as a work around. It basically brinks any bio setting for all apps.  Yes the phone has facial unlock . It doesn't work if your lieing down or in a dark car . Seems obvious Google didn't figure on this . My biggest hatred I suppose is Android being a knock off of IOS. Sort of a space 1999 of phons full of promise great actors but with a rotten unbelievable premise . I can't in sci fi terms suspend my disbelief and like comic book guy in simpons reviewing his creation. So i say this is crap .my problem is deed is done but I still returned the phone.

And can't use the feature.All problems would be fixed by having multiple face ids, unfortunately that isn't possible.As it is, the feature is quite annoying, since if i have to remove my sunglasses, not to mention shave, to get it to work, then that's not going to happen.As this is a pretty basic feature, i can't currently recommend the phone.",10

","November 26, 2019",No,"Completely not worth the money, and there is little to no improvement from the 3 or the 2.  I upgraded from the 2 XL which was and is a really good phone, thinking there was more to this 4 XL.  I upgraded my wife's iPhone 6s to the 11 pro and man - if I wasn't such an avid hater of iOS and all things Apple, I would take that phone in an instant.Pixel 4 XL Cons:  Battery life sucks already.  I can barely make 7 a.m. to 11 p.m., so I imagine this will degrade very fast in the near and distant future.  I don't take a lot of pictures, but if I do video it drains quick.  Watching videos the same situation.  I don't use the phone hardly at all, and text message a lot, and I'm always below 15% every night.  Audio port still gone for no reason I mean seriously?  The bar across the top.  Really?  For a sensor that Samsung failed to spread with the Galaxy 5?  Really?  Swipe my hands really?  No wide angle lens like the iPhone 11 pro, but yet a massive box on the back.  Ugly.  Vibration is still really poor.  How can you not have this as a setting to increase?  My legs are, as a result of decades of cell phone vibration, immune to Pixel vibration.  Tried the iPhone 11 pro and it's much more noticeable.  Sound volume still sucks.  It just doesn't play loud enough, especially speaker phone.  Like seriously it's mandatory to have wireless ear buds just so I can hear anything on my phone?  Or a bluetooth speaker?  Incessant Google Assistant - Quit asking me to set it up I'm not giving you my voice data regardless of how many times you ask.  And last but not least, my biggest gripe with Google services in general - backups.  There is ZERO support for full backups of your phone.  Especially your SMS and MMS.  ZERO.  So if you don't use a 3rd party app on a regular basis to backup your phone, you are screwed.  Don't ever let anyone tell you different, if you do a factory reset without a backup all of your app data including Messages will be erased and irretrievable.  Shame on a billion dollar company to not 1 let you know ahead of time, 2 false advertising that it can even do backups and 3 doesn't provide backup options.  SHAME SHAME.Pixel XL 4 Pros:  128 GB of storage?  The 90 hz that I can't use in any app but is supposedly there?All in all I'm more than disappointed in myself for buying this thing, especially on launch day when it's dropped $200.  And I'm just disappointed in Google.  They ruined my experience and there's nothing new on this phone that I didn't already have on my 2 XL.Unfortunately I still like the Google ecosystem but this will be my last Google phone.  I'd take that over priced Motorola Razor at least it has something new in it.",7
5.0,"Great Phone
  
","October 30, 2019",No,"I'm an iPhone user and bought the Pixel 4 for it's camera.  I do a travel blog and I've been dragging a Nikon D7500 camera with an 18-300mm lens with me.  The Pixel will allow me to put the ""camera"" in my pocket when I'm not using it.I've been testing the camera and It's not the same as the Nikon - it's better in low light but has some weaknesses in regular light.  The zoom is good and bad.  It will zoom well and give me a sufficiently sharp image - but the resolution (number of pixels) is not that large.  If I crop the picture there's not many pixels left.In regular light, I find the color and contrast a bit ""sharp"" which makes the picture look a bit processed.  I'm working on improving that with the adjustments I can do on the camera.  The Pixel does provide RAW images but they don't give me as much adjustment range as the RAW images from my Nikon.Some people complain about the lack of a wide angle camera but I can always do a panorama.  The battery should have been bigger so I'll get a battery case for it to make sure I have sufficient charge.  It just makes the phone a bit thicker which I don't object to.Otherwise, I find that Android provides pretty much the same features and functionality as my iPhone but does them differently so there's a learning curve for me.  Not really hard but it'll take time for me to be comfortable with it.Computational photography is obviously the future of photography and I expect that Google will make improvements to the camera over time.  But for my use, I think the Pixel 4 will release me from having to lug around a big camera and lens.  I bought the 128GB version to make sure I have enough memory for pictures, especially since I use the RAW function.  I'll dump the pictures to my computer each night.  I shoot more than four thousand pictures on a normal trip so dumping them off the phone each night is necessary.Overall, I'm pleased with the phone.  I really need more time with it but it looks good so far.",3

2.0,"Snapped along the antenna lines on the sides within 3 days
  
","December 4, 2019",No,"I bought this phone to replace my Pixel 3 XL, because its rear camera died 5 days after the warranty ended. (sigh)Initial impressions were poor. The lack of a fingerprint reader sucks, no matter how fast the face scanning is. I could unlock my Pixel 3 with an index finger before it even left my pocket, which is now impossible. It also doesn't always wake up and scan, meaning you have to tap the screen until it scans.The radar gimmick is, well, a gimmick. The only thing it seems to be useful for is swapping between songs, but it's very VERY unreliable even for this. It doesn't consistently detect swipes, so you end up waving your hand at your phone frantically with nothing happening. It's also supposed to wake up the screen when you reach for it. Again, the success rate of this seems to be pretty low, meaning you again have to tap the screen to wake it up. Wouldn't have been a problem with a fingerprint reader.I was ready to get over these deficiencies after the first couple of days, but then the worst thing happened. There are four antenna lines that run horizontally on the sides of the phone, under black paint. They're positioned above the power button and the SIM card tray at the top, with two more at the bottom somewhere. Somehow the entire phone bent inwards and snapped at this point, leaving two cracks on either side and the screen bent slightly inwards.I realize this is likely my fault, and I probably leaned on my pocket or something at some point. But I am 100% sure I did not put an excessive amount of pressure on the phone in the first few days. I've used the Pixel 3XL in the same pockets for the past year, and the Pixel 2 before that. The thing just snapped like nothing. There's no reinforcement in the sides whatsoever.This is a $1000 phone. Why does it feel like a cheap iPhone knockoff? I can't stand iOS, and Samsung are slow on updates. Google needs to step up their game and make a phone that's worth the pricetag.",2

They won't allow you to purchase and get a refund when the replacement arrives like many other manufacturers. So if this happens to you - you'll be severely inconvenienced.When I finally received the replacement, it took less than a month for the back camera to completely stop functioning.

Setup was simple, transferred data from my Galaxy S7 and started setting up security. That's where I realized there is no fingerprint reader. Not the end of the world but it's convenient, reliable and many apps use it as a primary authentication. OK, Google suggests FaceId so I set it up. It worked well at first, even though I can't call it ""secure"" because anyone can take your phone, point it at your face even when you are sleeping, and it gets unlocked. Still, I thought I'd get used to it. Within 2 days face unlock simply stopped working. I tried re-setup it, no luck. Says ""unable to recognize"". I had to go back to using a pattern which is not secure at all. Typing a pin code is a pain in the butt. Within a day the pattern recognition stopped working, not sure why. Tried searching for answers, the resolution is factory reset which you can't even do through normal settings... that didn't fix it either, so phone became useless. I ended up just returning it and getting a Galaxy S10. Not what I was hoping for but ultimately proved to be a better product. Sad to see that Google still can't make a decent Android phone.",1

I will never buy a Pixel phone on day one unless I win the lottery and money becomes no object. I recommend waiting that month to anyone who isn't rich.I upgraded from a Pixel 2 XL and owned a Nexus 6P before that. I enjoy Google's version of Android quite a bit and consider the hardware trade-offs worth it. My wife has a Samsung Galaxy S10 plus and there is no question that it's a more refined phone as far as screen, battery etc, but Samsung's version of Android -- while better than it was a few years ago -- is still bloated and unappealing to me.I consider this phone a worthwhile upgrade to my Pixel 2 XL. The screen is much better, and while it could be brighter it is noticably brighter in sunlight than the 2 XL. The 90 Hz display refresh rate makes for noticably smooth scrolling and is a welcome improvement, I have enabled it all of the time in Developer Options with no big jump in battery usage.The upgrade to 6 GB of RAM is also a welcome upgrade. I know that it's still stingy by flagship standards, but I see no lag in the phone so I'm okay with it.The black phone is indeed, as others have noted, a fingerprint magnet, but my phone always goes in a case anyway. If I didn't use a case I would definitely go with white or orange though.Wireless charging is a nice upgrade from my Pixel 2 XL, and from what I hear about the Pixel 3 much faster than on that phone.The battery life is fairly meh, but I find that even on heavy use days a quick boost during the day gets me through. Since I use Android Auto on my commute and the phone charges while plugged into that that's more than enough to get me through any day. I also have a wireless charger on my desk at work if need be. If I was in a situation where I was unable to charge my phone during the day the battery life on this phone might seem like more of a negative. If you are a heavy user who demands to go all day without charging than this probably isn't the phone for you.One thing I love about this year's design is the relatively flat screen. The curved screen of my 2 XL demanded an expensive Whitestone Dome screen protector to protect it without losing screen sensitivity, as does the curved screen of my wife's Galaxy S10 plus. The flat screen of the 4 XL only needs an inexpensive tempered glass screen protector to work perfectly and protect my investment. And I like the way the phone looks.I love the camera, which is always a strong point with Pixel phones. When I shoot video I use 1080p rather than 4k, so the fact that the phone doesn't support 4k 60 for video doesn't bother me. If video at that resolution and frame rate matter to you than this isn't your phone. I love this phone for still photography, which is a personal hobby, and the addition of the telephoto lens is a big plus. Wish they added a wide angle lens, too. That would have been a big plus. I don't shoot many selfies, but I know some users are bummed about the removal of the wide angle selfie camera from the Pixel 3. If that's important to you then you might want to get a different phone.I really like the face unlock. It has worked well for me. Fast and consistent. I don't even think about it much anymore, it just works. On rare occasions that taking my phone out of a pocket doesn't trigger the face unlock then double tapping the screen wakes it up.To sum up, while I don't think this is a perfect phone, I believe that the Google software experience combined with the camera and the bumped up RAM makes it a worthwhile upgrade for those like me who really like Pixel phones. I don't think they're for everybody, but I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this phone. One thing I would definitely recommend now that the phone has returned to post Black Friday full pricing is to wait for the next sale.As stated above, this phone isn't for everyone.  No phone is.  However, if you pay attention to the strengths and weaknesses and assess your own needs correctly it really is a great phone for the right user. I'm happy to stay in the Google Pixel experience for the next 2 years.  When I'm ready to upgrade I'll look at what will probably be the Pixel 6 XL and decide if that phone has earned the next 2 years of my phone usage.  Even if it does, I will certainly wait until the phone goes on sale to buy it.",0

Pixel 3? Perfect, readable but incredibly dim, Pixel 4? Blinding. How did they ship this thing?Next they drop the price $200 a month after launch to make sure loyal Pixel fans like myself feel like a proper idiot for taking the bait.My wife was already using my old 3 so I bought another Pixel 3 to ""downgrade"" to.

I could have waited a bit longer but my Nexus 6P went into an infinite boot loop a couple months ago after nearly 4 years, so I waited and got the Pixel 4 XL.As others have said, it doesn't have the brightest screen, but I find it sufficient. The 90 Hz refresh isn't on all of the time by default unless you enable it in the developer options, which I did.I noticed that some reviewers (in general) were disappointed with the battery life, but it lasts me the whole day with my level of usage. I bought a pair of Seneo wireless chargers, 6' USB-C cables, and adapters--one for the home and another for the office, also bought the iOttie wireless charger for the car. Needless to say, I'm rarely below 80% battery.So far, the radar sensor is just a gimmick for actually directing the phone to perform actions since it's a bit sluggish even for skipping through songs or YouTube clips. But I do appreciate the fact that it lowers the volume of my alarm when my hand reaches over it when I go to snooze it!The camera quality is fantastic for photos, and it's decent for video, the stabilization is great.The face unlock is very fast, and yes, it can unlock with your eyes closed, and who knows when that'll be fixed. I have a twin brother, and his face is similar enough to mine (not identical) that even he could unlock my phone... Which brings me to my next point: I really dislike the fact that there is no fingerprint reader. It's annoying that most apps don't acknowledge facial recognition for app logins yet, so I have to resort to typing in the pin or password.All in all, if you love stock Android and are due for an upgrade like I was, then this is a very good phone! To be honest, I have been pleasantly surprised at how stable Android 10 has been so far.",1

The 4XL is quick with the unlock sometimes, but half the time takes a second or two, which feels laggy for a $1000 flagship smartphone in 2019. The screen looks great, but not a noticeable difference from the 3XL. The camera seems no better than the 3XL. Honestly, I really REALLY wanted to love this phone.

","November 13, 2019",Yes,"I have returned this. But read the whole review before making any judgement.Pros.- The camera is the best in the market for normal usage. I say *normal usage* cause at the extremes (low light + filmy potraits + wide angles) iPhone 11pro is better. So, overally - Pixel 4 has the best camera.- Display with 90Hz is the best display out there. Period.- Software experience is amazing. Very clean and smooth.- Very fast and responsive.- Has some new features along with face unlock - it's not perfect by any means but it has potential.Cons.- This $1000 phone doesn't have a fingerprint sensor. Their sub $300 pixel 3a has it. *speechless*- 90Hz refresh rate is not permanent. It goes up and down depending on usage.- Camera cutout at the back is disgusting. But then, it's a personal preference.- No headphone jack and no microsd card slot.- With the forced 90Hz on, my potato has better battery life than this phone.So should you buy it? Yes, if you can get past the cons. Honestly, for some people the cons shouldn't be an issue. I mean we all carry chargers everywhere with us.

2.0,"Flagship price without the flagship performance/features
  
","October 22, 2019",Yes,"This review is of the white 64GB Pixel 4 (non XL) that I received from Amazon on 10/21/19. I have used it for exactly 48hrs so far and here is my early impressions –Good stuff –1. The build quality is impressive. The matte back is fingerprint resistant and the phone is a beauty!2. The dual (Stereo) speakers are loud and have good clarity.3. Fast charger is included with the phone.Bad stuff – Unfortunately this is a longer list.1. Battery life is miserable. The phone has a 2800mAh battery that lasted me 18hrs with &lt;30 minutes of screen on time. These 18hrs also included an 8hr of sleep time at night, so users will need to charge this at least twice daily, even with minimal usage.2. The 90Hz screen is mostly limited to 60Hz. You’ll have to enable “Force 90Hz” option in “Developer settings” if you want to use it in its full glory.3. The face unlock struggles in dark. It also sometimes does not work until you press the power button to activate the phone (I have radar on, so the phone does know my presence). In absence of other biometric options, a crappy face unlock isn’t ideal. One out of 3 times I had to enter my PIN, as the Face Unlock did not work. Most importantly, it works even with eyes closed, so it means someone can unlock your phone while you are sleeping by just pointing it at your face.4. There isn't a USB-C earphone included with the phone.5. There isn't a  USB-C to 3.5mm dongle included with the phone to use with headphones.6. Free unlimited storage on Google Photos is being discontinued with the Pixel 4 and Google wants you to pay for cloud storage.7. Base model is only 64GB, which is tiny for a phone in 2019. 128GB should have been the base model or at least a memory card slot should have been included.8. No dual front facing camera like the Pixel 3.9. No wide angle rear camera – This is a big deal for a 2019 flagship phone. Those who watched the Pixel 4 launch keynote, you know how stupid they sounded when they tried to justify the inclusion of telephote over wide angle.10. No 60fps or higher video recording at 4K. Google cited that the limited internal storage is the reason they have not enabled higher fps at 4K, even though the hardware is capable. I am speechless…can’t they just give the users an option?11. Too expensive at $799 for a flagship phone in 2019 with the above flaws.I am going back to my OnePlus phone, which isn’t flawless by any means, but is a very good phone for what it offers and the price it comes at. I can't recommend the Pixel 4 to anyone and don't know if the audience that Google is trying to sell this to, actually exists. If you really want a Pixel, get the 3a...it is a great phone at a very good price!",16

","October 26, 2019",Yes,"I used to wish I had a Pixel 3/3XL instead of my S8+, but I always told myself I would wait for the Pixel 4 to release before blowing a load of cash on a shiny new google device. I used my Pixel 4 for a day before returning it.Pros:1. Fantastic software - The entire interface, assistant, and just general ""all built in"" feel of using the phone is fantastic. However, Google is at it's core a software company, so this would make sense. It's THEIR ecosystem. We can only expect this.2. Solid build quality. Feels like a great phone. Responsive and clear display.3. The camera. I'm gonna miss this. It's pretty great and the magic google works on your photos often works out to make them look instagram/facebook/twitter ready without any tweaking.Cons:1. The battery life. I can not even begin to state what a huge, massive, gaping CON this is. The night I got it I used it a bit, got the battery down, and gave it a full charge in the morning and started the day with a full battery at about 10 AM. By 6:30 PM with minimal use over the course of the day here and there, 30 minutes of bluetooth music streaming in my car, some browsing etc., it got down to 9%.NOW, like I said, it was at 9% at 6:30 PM. What happened next was amazing. I hopped on the phone and opened Chrome, and while just browsing the web watched the battery drop percent by percent from 9% to dead over the course of SEVEN MINUTES. It just kept ticking down right in front of my eyes. Almost 10% battery life gone over seven minutes of web browsing. This totally blew me away.In case you haven't caught on to everyone's point of judgment yet, the pixel 4 actually has less battery capacity than the Pixel 3. This was  huge mistake on Google's part. This device consumes more battery life from a lower total supply. Unforgivable.2. The whole telephoto thing... Google did a regular lens and a telephoto lens. No ultra-wide. They gave some reason why but it was a bad reason based on how ""they feel.""3. The price. This is a flagship and is priced like a flagship, but is falling short of cheaper alternatives like the Oneplus 7T.I'm really bummed that this phone didn't work out for me. I just absolutely can not tolerate my phone dying after ~3.5 hours of use. I can't even imagine if I had tried playing Pokemon Go on it or something battery intensive. What if I were in another country and were relying on this thing? It just really doesn't work. I would have dealt with everything/almost anything else if not for the battery life issue.I hope that google really feels some serious scathing pain over this device pushing them to do a better job next year, because I REALLY wanted a good Pixel, but I won't be shocked if by then Amazon has released a phone that outperforms it in every way attached to their own ecosystem, like they have done with countless other products.This could have all been easily figured out and resolved of course, had the company made the specs of their phone public far earlier. The cries of ""what are they thinking?"" could have possibly allowed them to quickly pivot and resolve these issues, but instead they waited until a week before release to show off their paperweight.This has to some degree turned into rambling. I'm annoyed, I'm disappointed, I expected better.Just don't buy this phone.UPDATE: Due to a newer review stating that I ""must have had my phone on max brightness streaming 4K video"" I'm making this update to clarify my usage even further. I had the phone on adaptive brightness as most people would, and at no point did I stream video. It also looks like fake reviews are starting to pop up. I have no idea what the review about ""google haters and iphone lovers"" is about.",17

","November 6, 2019",Yes,"I had been looking for this technology for a few years,  because my corporate phone is on Verizon (CDMA) and my personal phone is GS/LTE , which meant that I had to carry two phones because of this issue.Pixel 4 DSDS and dual network capability (only phone on the market with this capability as of now), solved my problem in that I can now carry a single phone with 2 numbers in both CDMA (Verizon) and GSM/LTE coverage area.Good job google. I am willing to bet that Verizon hardware sales won't like this phone.There is however a downside with any phone that uses an eSim (yes one of the two sims on Pixel 4 is an eSim while the other is a physical sim), is that if your phone gets damaged, you will not have a physical sim to use in your spare phone and you must then get a physical sim activated by your provider...which means when your damaged eSim phone has been repaired, you will then have to download the eSim back onto your eSim phone (which I think will mean yet another visit to your provider)This is of course not a problem if you don't have a habit of breaking your phones, like I do.",13

","October 25, 2019",Yes,"So considering switching from the iPhone and testing this out. We are not off to a good start.First off, I was excited by the possibilities of the new Recorder app and built-in transcription. Turns out, this is not installed by default when you get the phone. It's the old Recorder (version 0.5).To get the new Recorder, along with many of the other features that Google touts the Pixel 4 having, you have to go manually update all the apps (Open the Play Store, Select Your Apps, then Select Updates). THEN it installs Recorder 1.0 which has the transcription stuff.However, this is not obvious. Why would Google ship with Recorder 0.5 and other non-release version apps? Frustrating when you're trying to check out all the 'cool' new features touted at the launch. Apple would never do something like this. At least automatically update all the apps when it does the initial 'Check for System Updates'.Secondly, Google's support is useless. They don't know anything and that's assuming you can figure out how to contact them.The camera is great, but nothing special compared to other phones at this point. The HDR trick they use to deal with low light photos leaves something to be desired. I'm not crazy about the look.With the Just Black phone, both front and back are glass which makes it somewhat slippery. You'll probably need a case with it. It's frosted along the sides which is great, but it'd be better if there was more surface area on the back that was frosted.So, a little disappointed with how frustrating it's been out of the box. Now that everything has been updated, we'll see if the user experience improves. Right now, I'll probably return this and stick with the iPhone.",7

Battery life is more than acceptable, not a top feature. Video stabilization is good, but looks artificial at times. It's different from the iPhone or a GoPro with HyperSmooth. Soli is neat but I don't use it for gestures, just proximity stuff and to speed up face unlock. Screen resolution is a good balance of resolution and performance on the XL.

From full charge in the morning, to browsing the internet, listening to music via bluetooth headphones, checking email, etc etc periodically through the day, I usually end up with about 40-50% battery left easily. To say its done within a couple of hours, that person must have max screen brightness and streaming 4k videos. The screen is incredible, and camera flawless. I am however taking off a star due to not caring for the round edges on the screen and am still having a hard time adjusting to face unlock over fingerprint. Everything else about the phone is nothing short of extremely well executed.One more point, how on earth is face unlock any less secure than a fingerprint scanner? Both can only be opened by the person using the phone. And someone could just as easily put your finger on a scanner as moving it over your face if you're incapacitated. So confused by that one, but that guy got on here to troll as he doesnt even have a verified purchase. Not sure what his agenda is.",5

Critics knocked this phone, but I gotta tell ya. It's fantastic.Pros:* The Vanilla Android Experience. It's fantastic. Much better than Samsungs or LGs UI.* Camera - I don't care what DXO Mark says. This and the Iphone 11 have the best cameras. I was using the Note 10+ before this and it doesn't even come close. If you have kids that move around. This is the camera to get. Hands down.* Face Unlock - Never thought I'd appreciate it so much. Fast, accurate. Fantastic* Screen - Fantastic. Smooth. I turned the 90Hz off and didn't notice a difference. It's great.* Sound Quality -  As good as the best out there.Cons -* Battery life is Good. Not terrible. But at these prices you expect Google to keep up with phones like the Note 10* They took away the finger print scanner, which is fine, but with that they also took away the ""Menu Down"" feature you could use w/ the finger print scanner. That....I miss.* I would have wanted a bigger screen for this price, bu that's me being picky.* Price - Only buy this phone on sale. Not woth $900 or 1K .

4.0,"Good phone if you manage to get it on sale
  
","December 2, 2019",Yes,"So I decided to buy Pixel 4 since I was being really disappointed with the direction that Samsung was going towards in terms of hardware and software. Here are my impressions after some time with it when comparing it with my Galaxy S9+ :Hardware features: I don't really care for headphone jack but it is inexcusable that Google removed fingerprint sensor. Using it is much more convenient than face unlock and fingerprint sensor is much more reliable in all light conditions. I really miss it when going from S9+ to Pixel 4. Bring it back, Google.Display: the display quality on my Galaxy S9+ is better - it is more uniform and feels like it is more color accurate. Especially when looking at it at an angle or turning the phone. On the other hand I really dislike curves on the sides of Galaxy display and I like that Google went with flat display. I also dislike that Samsung is putting random notches and holes into their display on their latest models and I like how Google has finally abandoned this trend and hopefully future Pixel devices also won't have any notches or holes.Battery life: the battery life on Pixel 4 XL is better compared to Galaxy S9+. Not really surprising since Samsung puts a lot of their own services running in background. However, having more battery capacity would be even better since Pixel 4 XL lasts less on single charge than any iPhone 11 model or some Android phones with higher battery capacity.Software: Google's software experience is great and I like it much more than Samsung and its awful One UI. No huge wasted space, no excessively rounded corners, working spam call protection, better messenger, no bloatware, no redundant apps. The only issue with Google software is they put the search bar on home screen which I do not want to use and you cannot remove it unless you will use different launcher.Sound quality: the sound quality on Samsung Galaxy S9+ is better. It is more neutral, with less bass emphasis.Photo quality: it is better on Pixel 4 in all modes.Video quality: Galaxy S9+ takes better video quality and it can record 4k 60fps videos, Pixel 4 cannot do that.All in all Pixel 4 XL is a good phone for the current sale price but it should have been much better considering it is a flagship device and considering that whole idea of Android and their devices is to give users more choice. Hopefully Google will bring fingerprint sensor back in future devices, give more video taking options and give larger battery capacity (even cheapest iPhone 11 is beating Pixel 4 XL in terms of battery use).",0
5.0,"Great phone! HUGE UPGRADE from Pixel 3 XL. Don't believe the tech reviews.

I actually bought the phone and used it for a few months. And loved it.I was personally tired of hiding the notch on the 3 XL. Bought this phone as an upgrade and never looked back. Snappier, better build quality and heftier in the hand thanks to that frosted glass, and to me overall a better looking phone. I was finally able to get myself the white version, and kind of had to since Google was smoking something and thought leaving no matte black option (or even a mint color like they previously advertised), so white was my best bet. The 90hz display was a huge bonus, as is the face recognition. Those two features alone, along with the radar features makes this phone well worth the upgrade, especially if it's at a discount like Black Friday, which is when I got mine!Overall I'm happy with my purchase. Don't believe the tech reviews who are paid to stir drama and hate about this phone, it's a beast, a workhorse, it is reliable as hell, and it's the best pure android experience to date.",0

The two main complaints I've read about are a lack of a wide focus camera and battery size.I've never owned a phone with a wide angle lens, but there have been a few times where I wish I had one, but the camera on this phone rocks, and I can't fault it for not having a feature I've never had on past phones.Yes, the battery is smaller than industry standard for modern smart phones.  But what's amazing is that with a small battery, a processor that's one version behind the most current, and a 90 hz screen, the small battery lasts longer than expected and I haven't been disappointed about battery life.  And when it does need to be replenished, it charges FAST.I was hesitant making the purchase because of the critical reviews, but I've been pleasantly surprised that the most talked about issues aren't really issues at all.",0

4.0,"Unspectacular but solid
  
","December 12, 2019",Yes,"When the new Pixel 4 was released I took a look at my two-year-old Pixel 2 and wondered if I really needed to upgrade, given what a great phone it had been, and still is. Giving in to a bit of retail therapy is easy, so I did.It's an expensive business getting a Pixel phone in this country (New Zealand) since it's a buy from Amazon in the US, shipping to the other end of the world, paying GST (our sales tax) converted to NZ dollars added up to $1,550.Was it worth it? Let's take a look.I've owned a lot of android phones and had the Pixel 4 for a few months now and it's performed pretty much flawlessly, both the software and the hardware - as I expected it would. I really like Google's own implementation of their Android O/S - it's clean and just works. There are some UI annoyances that I'll come to later. Other makes (Huawei, Samsung) all seem to be clogged up with unnecessary and buggy extra apps and take years to get Android updates through. I get Google's updates within days of release and I've never had a bad one.In their attempt to regain a handful of pixels from the bottom of the screen, Google have removed the Home and Back on-screen buttons and replaced them with gestures. This has or will probably occur on other makes of phone as Android 10 rolls out. The new gesture needs a swipe from the bottom edge (home) or from either side (back), and I pretty much hate it.If you miss the edge (it's tricky if you have a case with a raised edge) then you end up swiping the app off to somewhere unwanted. If you get a bit close to the edge when you're scrolling within an app, you suddenly go home or back. It doesn't happen to me very often but when it does happen it's infuriating. Hint: When buying a case, look for one with a low profile on the screen side - though that won't protect the screen quite as well.As for other features, I'm not so sure there's a lot to say. The main one is the face recognition lock which I've turned on and also the ""Keep phone unlocked while I'm looking at it"" option. I like that one, it saves the phone going black when I'm taking my time reading, or something. It's also nice to just pick up the phone and look at it, it's so natural, quick and easy. People seem unduly worried about the security of this feature, I'm not sure why except maybe for the unlock while you're asleep. If someone is in a position to do that, then they are also in a position to do many awful things to me and additionally, the banking and other vulnerable stuff on my phone has a further level of security.The screen is up to par, and the glass is nice not picking up oily finger goop like all my others did after a while. I've given up on screen protectors, my phones are pretty safe being mostly in my pocket, and I like the feel of the screen. Feels like a solid build to me without being too heavy, though it's heavier than the Pixel 2 and has quite a bit more screen, mostly in the length.People seem to rave about the camera and I agree it's good, but so was the Pixel 2 so the step up doesn't seem huge to me - but then I'm no camera buff. The Pixel 2 was a bit better at close-ups which I do a lot of when working with electronics. The Pixel 4 can be zoomed up to 8x but can't focus closer than about 120mm which limits its use as a macro camera. The P2 was good down to about 60mm. (4.7"" and 2.4"")Sound is surprisingly good watching a video. There's nothing at the bass end but that's to be expected in such a small body. The volume is good and the sound spread is wide though perhaps a bit overdone. I'm not in a cathedral. I regularly use speakerphone and also Sennheiser Bluetooth headphones, and they perform very well on both phone calls and music. Bluetooth, WiFi, and 4G connectivity all seem solid.Battery life is marginal, my only real complaint about the hardware. An overnight charge to 100% would all be gone by 7pm if I wasn't quite careful. To counter this I bought a charger for the car so I can give it a commute-time top-up and things are better now. Wireless charging is cool and Qi chargers all seem to work fine. Makes charging in the car a breeze with a charger built into the holder. Wireless charging is not fast, about 0.9 amps, compared to a fast charger which charges at nearly 3 amps (~1 hr full charge time) but it turns the phone into a hotplate and could affect battery life.I recently bought a Samsung Galaxy Active 2 Smartwatch (SM-R810) and paired it up easily with the Pixel via Bluetooth, but with a fair amount of convoluted messing about with the Samsung apps got it all working reasonably well though it's a bit crazy and somewhat buggy. I sure wish Samsung would produce practical software like Google does. I did a review on the watch too.So was it worth it? Probably not, but mostly because my old Pixel 2 was such a nice reliable workhorse that has never slowed down even with 150 or so apps. Every other phone I ever owned has slowly ground to a standstill. I use quite a lot of apps.Am I glad I bought it? For sure, but I just can't part with the Pixel 2 so now that one's a spare.",0

No 3.5 jack (OK fine everyone is doing it, but it is really inconvenient) AND only biometric is face recognition (it does not work always, which is very annoying coming from a 100% success with fingerprint reader, especially for my banking apps). THINK ABOUT THE TIMES YOU NEED TO UNLOCK YOUR PHONE AND CAN'T LOOK AT IT. No other useful sensors either. Motion sense is a gimmick with no added convinience, and rather a battery drainer.Finally, camera is pretty awesome, but giving the fact that some of it is software, it seems that Google wants to push their crappy hardware using their quality software.

Sound quality is great and with connected Bluetooth headphones too. No dropped calls and shows 1 bar more then iPhone 8 Plus in my area with the same carrier.90Hz OLED screen stands out and makes everything you do on this Pixel very smooth, especially games.Battery holds whole day easily with my typical usage and fast charging helps in case you need some juice quickly.I did put on thin silicon protecting case and privacy screen protector and still can use it with one hand, many other phones are too wide.Very happy that I switched from other brand, cause Google provides 3 years of updates and that is very important, when other brands launch new phones every 6 months but don't support them good enough.",5

Camera - the ability for wide-angle/regular and telephoto to 6x(3x optical and 6x digital).  - Google decided to give 2x optical zoom, why? the pixel shift could have covered the 2x zoom. Why?  - no wide-angle, ok you can give Google a pass here as you can take panning pictures.  but a single click wide angle is what people wanted.2.  fingerprint sensor? did anyone complain about not wanting it? NO. it is the most natural way to unlock/security.  - People wanted a fingerprint sensor on the front  - Google dropped it altogether. why?  In short no one in Google is bothering to build a product that the people need.",3

","December 24, 2019",No,"My wife’s phone started acting up so I gave her my 3 month old LG G8, and went about purchasing a replacement.  I bought the pixel 4 initially and really liked it but the battery life left a lot to desire.  I went with the XL and will share my thoughts.Design:  No matter what color you get I like the look in the back and the square camera bump all looks nice.  The contrasting power button and google logo looks nice.  Interestingly enough the large awkward forehead on the 4, looks less so on the xl size might have something to with the 4 compact and narrow size vs the xl. While some people think phone looks dated or utilitarian, I find it attractive and kind of iconic.  The pixel 4 is one of the few phones you can look at the front of it and identify what phone it is.Screen:  The xl uses a samsung panel vs the lg panel the smaller sibling uses.  You would think the higher ppi on the xl would make a significant difference, but I was not able to find it.  It might just be that I prefer the lg panel as the QHD on the G8 was noticeable vs  the full hd+ of the pixel 4.  The 90 hz refresh is nice I would not call it a can’t live without it feature though.  It does make scrolling more smooth, but I am not a gamer so that is really the only benefit for me.Feel:  The xl is the biggest phone I have ever owned.  It is amazing when you put it against the g8 it only seems slightly taller but then in the hand they feel different.  I find the lg g8 is the perfect size phone with good one handed use and enough screen real estate to make searching comfortable.  On the regular 4 it was too narrow and did not have enough room in landscape mode for the keyboard to enter data when browsing.  The xl is large but is not so bad to operate one-handed.  The xl size allows for better media consumption as well.Fack unlock:  there is no fingerprint sensor and some people will bemoan the loss of it but the face unlock works reliably and quickly.  The whole it unlocks with your eyes closed complaint which is corny to me and I will echo what others have said in that if you are worried about someone taking your phone while you are asleep and unlocking it, then you probably have bigger problems than a phone purchase.Camera:  I am not a professional and I just want something that is easy to operate and that takes photos that look good.  The pixel does this and the camera snobs say it is one of if not thee best.Performance and Sound:  has a flagship processor so it is fast,  not much more to say without splitting hairs that it does not have the 855+.  It sounds good as well with stereo separation.  I don’t like the lack of headphone jack but this is the current trend.Battery life:  I got rid of the regular pixel 4 mostly because of its battery life with light use seemed to go down quickly.  I can’t remember the last time I had battery anxiety and with the pixel 4 unfortunately I did.  Not so with the xl, which for me last a day and a half.  With a smartphone, I should be able to be away from a charger for a full day and feel like my phone won’t die on me.  I think reviewers are lumping pixel 4 battery life with the xl model they are nothing alike.Value:  I find flagships too pricey overall and I will always wait for sales which can come quickly for plenty of devices. I paid $499 for the g8 less than 6 months after release, and paid $599 for the regular 4 a month after release and then paid $749 for the xl.  $600 is my threshold but I was able to rationalize it because it came with a google nest home hub free, which I will re-gift to someone.  The issue I have though is with the price is the small base storage and lack of accessories in the box..  It does not include headphones, or even adapter since there is no headphone jack.  Plenty of phones come with a screen protector applied, and a case in the box.  Disappointing.Competition:  there are plenty of good to great phones out there, and deciding on one is of course personal preference. I didn’t choose any of the oneplus phones because they don’t offer wireless charging which I like.  Samsung is out for me as well because seem to be doing their own thing with one UI.  ZTE has a nice phone at a good price that I did consider but I they have a slow upgrade path.  I went with the pixel line because of its compatibility with all things android, has all the main features I value in a smart phone and as far as I know is the only brand that the native voicemail allows transcription on my carrier without an extra purchase.  The lg line is  right up there as well, but they lack the quick updates, and native voicemail does not work on my carrier. Last generation pixels do offer better value minus some features like no 90 hz and slow wireless charging.Final thoughts:  When you compare the pixel 4 vs the G8 I was depressed because the pixel 4 just does not measure up and it felt like a step back.  WIth the XL model I don’t feel that way, which is odd because the xl adds a larger battery, higher resolution.  I think this mostly goes to that the pixel 4 is probably too small for me and while the xl is on the big size I can easily move throughout the web and not feel cramped when doing it.  I feel that the xl measures up to the G8 even with the price difference.  The xl does not have as many ways to do the same thing as the g8 (unlocking your phone, listening to music) but it has 90 hz screen, better camera, better ui, original design and for me native voicemail with transcription.  I do like the G8 size better but using the xl does not make me jealous that my wife now has the G8.",1

","December 26, 2019",No,"I was given this phone as a gift, from my father who bought it on Amazon and it was unlocked. The only downfall I would say is that if you are constantly using your phone then yes the battery does die faster and the only other issue is there is no headphone jack you have to buy a certain type that is an C part capable. Meaning that it plugs in where you plug in your charger so you need to look for headphones that would work through your charger or Bluetooth. The pictures are amazing and the portrait quality is even better. It is lightweight and not thick and not too big the sound and speaker is loud and better than I expected. It has a lot of cool little features and hand gestures and face recognition. If you're looking for a good phone and the quality of pictures is important to you then this phone will fulfill your need. There is no SD card but it did come with a little adapter to transfer information from your old phone to the new phone. The speakers are loud and the only downfall honestly is the battery. Again if you're always using it in your car to stream music and you don't keep your phone plugged in then there may be an issue but if you have a car charger then there really should be no issues and it has wireless charging. I have attached a picture so you can see the quality of a close up picture",1

","December 26, 2019",No,"Extremely disappointed in this phone. I've had it for 4 days and I'll be returning it. This device had so much potential but they cut so much that it's mediocre at best.Battery Life:The elephant in the room. It is garbage. I turned off motion sense and smooth display and it's still bad. This is what happens when you put a 2800 mAh battery in a 2019 ""flagship"" device. Only saving grace is that their fast charge is truly fast.Camera:Why no wide angle lens???Face unlock:For the phone, it's ok. Comparable to iPhone and others. In apps (that use finger print) next to useless. I find myself needed to enter my password for apps I was able to use a finger print for in the past. Alot of this is on developers, however, why not include a fingerprint reader as well?I do have some positives. Myself having smaller hands, the size is just right. I don't find myself struggling to reach my thumbs across the screen like I do with Galaxy S10+, iPhone 11. In this regard, it's comparable to 3a but I seem to like the 4 experience better.The regular zoom camera lives up to previous Pixel camera standards.In summary, I really want to love this phone. After all, there is a reason I upgraded my daily driver to this device. Unfortunately, I find myself missing my pixel 2 more than enjoying the Pixel 4. After this experience, I'm really not sure I'll buy another pixel device.",0

","December 6, 2019",No,"I have been waiting for the Pixel 4 for about 2 years now, as more information leaked it seemed to be a promising device and I was quite excited to be upgrading from my Pixel 2 XL to the Pixel 4 XL.

I watched the keynote and was VERY disappointed in this device, they made excuses for not having the wide-angle lens, 5g support, and bad battery. I decided to still roll the dice on this device and thought “hey I trust google to put out something that competes with the top of the phones currently out”, boy was I wrong.Pros+ Face detection when it works is fast+ Smooth interface+ Project Soli is kind of cool+ CameraCons- Bad battery life - won't last a day with normal use!- Face detection works about 40-60% of the time- No fingerprint sensor- You cannot use the new Google Assistant with having the old navigation.- Project Soli does not have many applications- Non-5g phone- No wide-angle lensConclusion - If you want a phone that is mediocre compared to the other current flagship phones and a battery that won’t last the entire day get the Pixel 4 XL.
