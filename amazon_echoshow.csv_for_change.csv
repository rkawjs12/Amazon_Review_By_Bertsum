"It's a winner!Over and over, in the ""most helpful"" reviews, I read about ""ads"" displaying. This does NOT ever display ads, it displays Alexa skills and things to try with your device. I read that people cannot get that to stop happening. It's right in the settings: go to: ---Home &amp; Clock--- then: ---Home Content--- then, turn off ---Discovery---, that will end the Alexa skills displaying (may cycle once after setting but then they're gone for good). I kept reading that people who want to use it as a clock were upset that the clock kept getting minimized (to left corner) to show other things. That's because, yet again, they aren't setting it up correctly. So, in the settings: go to: ---Home &amp; Clock--- then: ---Home Content--- then, turn off ---Rotate Continuously---, that will make the Home screen always display a full screen clock. You can also just turn off any content in that list. Note that each time you go into the settings, immediately after, it WILL show you a single skill or any content you left on. But that's it. It will just be a clock from then on, until you interact with it again and then it may display a single skill or that content. Once. Then back to being a full time clock.Full disclosure: I got this to use as an alarm clock and not as a primary viewing assistant. For that, I recommend the larger echo devices. I also got this on Prime Day for $50 (rather than $90). That's a screaming good deal for what is basically a voice activated, smart alarm clock with a lot of different options.Decent Alarm clocks run $30-50 anyways so I thought I'd give this device a try for $50. I should have bought 2. Even for $90, I feel like this is a great device but if you wait, it will eventually go on sale again. I don't intend to use it to watch TV shows or movies, I have TVs, tablets and PCs for that. I saw people mentioning being disappointed in the resolution or screen quality. I don't see the problem. This certainly isn't going to compare to your $300-800 smart phone screen but it's not bad looking when playing videos or displaying the clock. It's similar to say, an iPhone 3 or Galaxy S2. I feel like the people complaining are expecting ""the moon"" for the money this costs. It's $90. Not $150 or $200.There was alot of fairly bad reviews on the echo 5, but I wanted something bigger that I could use to see my ring doorbell video.  Setup was easy and got it running no problem.  Tried ""alexa show me the front door""... and nothing worked!!  No panic, went and pushed the ring doorbell and checked my phone, live video seen no problem.  OK, try Echo again ""alexa show my the front door""  Bingo!!  video displayed in about 3 sec's (i'd seen comments it was taking over 11 seconds) but that's not what I experienced.Next sound quality, tried a few songs... Wow I was not expecting much in the audio quality, but it was actually really good and as a side benefit, it displays the words of the song as it's sang, pretty cool.  Basically all the other alexa functions work as with any device, but now you also get video feedback. Ask about the weather,  get your info, plus it displays the  temp, clouds, sun, whatever...  Very happy with purchase and highly recommended!!"
"Great, but for one fatal flaw.I really do enjoy this device and am impressed at the abilities of Alexa. That said, until they add the option to disable the “Try Alexa” suggestions on the bottom of the home screen I can’t recommend it and will not be buying addition units.Looking online I am far from the only person driven crazy by this so I hope Amazon listens to the feedback and makes this possible in a future update.EDIT: The current top review claims that I (and everyone else complaining about this) am wrong and this can be disabled. While this person is right in the fact you can customize a lot of the display, the “try” suggestions at the bottom are not one of them. For the record I contacted Amazon support before posting my review to confirm this. Anyone who says otherwise is simply wrong."
"I thought it would be better.I had the echo 5 and I can't stand the ""try Alexa"" phrases at the bottom. From all the reviews I read on the 5 I wasn't the only one. I hope Amazon realized that people didn't like this. I will be returning this. At least make it a option."
"Echo Show 8: Good But Not Quite as Good as the Echo Show 5.I have had an Echo Show 5 for over a month in my work office and like it a great deal. I ESPECIALLY like the ability to customize the clock.I received the new Echo Show 8 as a gift this past weekend and like it for most of the same reasons I like the Echo Show 5: great connectivity; good diversity of content and skills; and great as a sound speaker and photo display.But I found that the ES8 does not have the same options for clock faces as the ES5. There is no apparent reason for this, nor is it highlighted in the marketing for the ES8. Amazon, please update the ES8 software to permit at least the same range of clockfaces as the ES5."
"Alexa, I don't want any ""Things to Try"".Aaaaaaaggghhh!  The ""Things to Try"" sayings are sooooooooo annoying.  And they are so stupid and do not pertain to me at all.  ""Alexa, how do you say hello in German?"", ""Alexa, rap for me."", ""Alexa, how hot is the sun?"", ""Alexa, what's the temperature on the North Pole?"", blah, blah, blah.  They constantly scroll overtop of the pictures  and photos that you upload to the home screen and wallpaper, making them really hard to ignore.  And the clock is so small in the upper left corner, that you have to be right on top of it to read it.  I couldn't take it any more and had to return my new Echo Show 8."
"Perfect Echo Show - size and quality.This Echo Show is a winner.  I have a LOT of Echo Shows around my house (various models) and I like this the best.  The screen is much better quality (and larger) than the Echo Show 5 and larger screen than the first generation Echo Show.  The design takes up less room than the earlier Echo Show models and looks better too.  If you buy a stand for it, get the one from EchoGear (shown in my photos).  It works great and tilts up and down and swivels.  The screen looks great (HD) and sound is excellent.  I like the switch on the top to turn off the camera and microphone (like the Echo Show 5)."
"So easy and so good with Ring cameras.I received my new Echo Show 8 - HD 8"" smart display with Alexa a couple hours ago. I had it unpacked and connected to my WIFI within 30 minutes. I have 3 Ring cameras, front door bell, a front &amp; back yard motion light cameras. Once I followed the steps to add Ring in the Alexa app, like 2 minutes, It was so intuitive I don't know what I did right but another 5 minutes I said Alexa show front door and she said okay and there was my front door camera on the screen. Then I said Alexa, show back which is what I named the devise ""back"" and she said okay and showed the back yard camera, same with the front successfully. I have many more smart devices the Alexa app found on my wi-fi so I'm excited to figure out how to add them.Also, now I understand the importance of naming the devices. Alexa only understands exactly what you name them in the devise list for voice commands."
"Scaled down version of the show 2, but a bargain.I have a bunch of Echo devices in my home. Including the Echo show  2 10 inch.I feel like this is the best bargain at current prices.Sure you are getting 20 percent smaller in terms of screen size. But the difference is not too crazy.The screen resolution is almost the same. It looks very good.The sound is very solid in the echo show 8.I think the 8 is a compressed version on the 10 inch version. But that doesn't mean it's not good.Overall, I would definitely consider getting this over the 10 inch model. The price difference justifies it."
"A Great Addition to Your Home Tech.This is my first Echo device.  Had already set up several skills on the Alexa app before the Echo Show 8 arrived, so I was ready for it; and had my expectations already set as to the quality of the response to the voice commands.  If you are considering entering the Echo 'echo-system' and are on the fence about getting one of these, try downloading the Alexa app to your phone or tablet and try it out.  On the phone app (iPhone and iPad in my case), a button push activates Alexa; with the Show 8, just say her name and she starts listening.Some of the Alexa skills still need some work, and your satisfaction with them may vary.  But for the Show 8, it's great!  The speakers sound better than  I expected (actually are pretty awesome compared to the Show's size) and will fill the room with sound.  The Show 8 has an external speaker jack on the back, but I don't see ever using it - the internal speakers are THAT good - can feel the bass from the speakers vibrating the kitchen countertop.  With the speakers in the rear, having it backed up close to a wall provides the best sound projection and quality.  A similar concept to some higher end Bose speakers, which have rear-firing elements that are designed to reflect the sound off of a wall and provide more ambience.When music is played, the lyrics scroll on the screen, so you can sing along (if your housemates and dog can stand it).  Even when playing at a higher volume level, I can still get Alexa's attention but it may take more than one attempt.  The microphones are quite sensitive and will pick me up from another room as long as there is not much background noise.  The Show 8 also has Bluetooth, so you can pair it with a phone, laptop or other device and play music through the Show 8's speakers.  I do this frequently since the Show 8's speakers sound much better than the internal phone or laptop speakers.  I did notice a bit of a delay in watching a video on the laptop, and then the audio coming out of the Show 8.  It just may be an artifact of using Bluetooth to send the audio.Rather than the recommended stand (or no stand), I purchased the ""Echo Show 8 Adjustable Aluminum Swivel Stand"" also sold on Amazon (you can see my review of the stand on that page).  A stand is recommended to allow you to position the Show 8 at an optimum viewing angle.I also purchased several of the Meross Wifi smart plugs (also sold on Amazon).  Have them programmed to link with Alexa so I can give one command (such as ""Alexa, turn on Christmas Lights"") and ALL the plugs in the Christmas group turn on at the same time.  Pretty cool!  Once Christmas is over, the plugs will be assigned other duties.The Show 8 can browse the web.  There is a Firefox skill that will allow you to open a web browser.  And if you don't like tapping letters on the screen, you can pair a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse (see photo).  If you have an HP printer, it can be linked to the Show 8 to print grocery lists or stuff you find on the internet.Not a deal-killer for me, but can't seem to be able to disable the ""Try Alexa &lt;blah blah blah&gt;"" on the bottom of the home screen.  You CAN disable the skills cycling with other topics in the center of the screen as another reviewer noted.  I have the Show 8 in my kitchen; so the display is not ""in my face"" and I am not looking at it all the time, so it is not THAT big of a deal.Have to admit I was skeptical and wasn't sure if I would find it useful....but I'm liking this device more every day.  Now an Echo Dot has found its place in our household as well.  Along with some Echo Buttons....Like the Echo Show 8 so much that I ordered another one to give to my daughter and son-in-law!"
"Perfect in the kitchen!We keep the Amazon Show 8 in our kitchen, and the whole family enjoys using it. Display is perfect size on the kitchen counter. We enjoy playing music (sounds great) and of course, we enjoy asking Alexa for the temperature or the weather forecast, and asking basically any question you can think of. Recipe feature is excellent too!"
"Backlight Bleeding.I love the way I can control Home Automation with Alexa. Was so excited to get the echo show 8, as my first echo screen unit. But as soon I powered it on, first thing I can see is the backlight bleeding so much. Is this normal to have that much, or did I got a bad unit? Anyway I thought it would be ok as you can see much when there is a brighter picture in it. But when it got inactive, I’ll have only a clock and a black screen full with backlight bleed. Will contact Amazon and see if it’s normal or if I can get a replacement.——Edit: Amazon it’s awesome, and it’s sending me a replacement. Will post back once the new unit arrives.——Edit: added a picture for comparison. Second unit looks really good. Thank you."
"""Things to Try"" makes this a product I can't recommend.I wrongly assumed that this new improved Echo Show would offer a way to turn off the absolutely annoying ""Things to Try.""  I was wrong.  Until they come up with a way of turning it off, I can't give a good review to this product or to any other Echo with a screen (Show, Spot).  I would put an Echo Show 8 in every room if they would allow me to kill the Things to Try."
"Be sure to visit Settings for a better Echo 8 experience.Although I get frustrated with Alexa (a lot), this Echo Show 8 has been a treat so far compared to the Echo and the Echo Dot. And I haven’t even used it for cooking yet, which is why I got it. It’s just immeasurably better to have a screen.At first I was overwhelmed by what seemed to be random *stuff appearing all over the home screen, but when I went to Settings&gt;Home Content and turned most of the options off, now Home is just a picture and a small clock with the current temperature underneath it. Much better!Edited to add: if I interact with Alexa (i.e., ask for weather) afterwards I am getting a “Try Alexa” suggestion, so I can understand where if you’re doing a lot with the device, that could become an annoyance.The sound quality impressed both my husband and me for the most part. (Maybe we’re just not very discerning in that regard.)Anyway, I like it a lot. Oh, I almost forgot to mention that I really appreciate being able to turn off the camera, too.P.S. It would be nice to be able to customize the clock face; that’s one thing I was disappointed by."
"The Pros, Cons and Oks for the Echo Show 8 (HR).Pros:__________• Very compact and simple design.  I like these designs because they can fit in all rooms. Bedroom, Kitchen, and the living room this echo can fit in any location.• It has a large rubber foot that keeps it from shaking around.• Big fan of the black mesh fabric that covers the back of the device. It doesn’t become a finger/dust print magnet.• Extremely simple setup as you do the setup right on the screen (you don’t need to download any app). All you need is Wi-Fi and you’re basically done.• You can set multiple alarms and have them repeat on various days of the week. Change the alarm tone, have the sound gradually increase to get you out of your sleep, and be able to play the music that you want. This a customized alarm system that fits anyone’s needs.• To add more customization, you can make this device a picture frame. You can set a single pic or a slideshow of pics as your background.• I love the privacy. To have a “physical” shutter, to block the camera, is an excellent choice. If I didn’t have this, I would, like every laptop, place some tape in order to block the viewing. It’s very quick to just slide on the shutter. In this day in age, you never know whose watching. It’s the little things, like these, that shows that Amazon knows what we want (sometimes).• There is a button (next to the volume controls) on the device that will allow you to mute the mic.• You can say to Alexa ""delete everything I said today"" to erase your recorded search history (The little things go a long way).• Even when I block the camera shutter, I can still take calls or talk to Alexa.• The light sensor goes into a nighttime display when the lights are off. Waking up at 3 to check the time was quick and painless to my eyes. The sensor is able to add the appropriate amount of light, depending on how much light is in the room. It’s similar to the auto-brightness we have on our smartphones.• Has a built-in 3.5 mm audio cable which means you can plug this in your home speaker system. I didn’t find the need to test this out because it’s just plugging into another speaker.• Two web browsing options, Firefox and Amazon Silk, but I recommend you stick with Firefox (Found it better in the use with this device).• Like all voice commands, asking Alexa for the weather, make a call, play music, turn on a light (a smart light), and so forth does its job, most of the time (will go into details in the Con section).• Software-wise, I do appreciate that on the screen, if you hit the smart home button, organizes what devices you use frequently. I found this very useful to see what smart devices I use the most (what a shocker that it was the smart lights in my house.) It is useful if you need to quickly turn a specific smart device off.• If you have a thermostat smart device, one cool feature is changing the temperature with the Show 8. I ask Alexa to change the temperature of my thermostat and a slider pops up on the screen, allowing me too automatically to tweak the temperature further.• There is also a button, on the device menu, to turn off everything connected to the Show.• The voice calls come through the Alexa app or through Skype.• Does have Bluetooth. As Sheldon Cooper wisely once said, “Everything is better with Bluetooth.”• The microphone picks up my voice very quickly. This is having the TV on average person volume level and, probably, 20 feet away.• The screen is actually viewable. Having seen the Echo 5 in the past, The Show 8 screen is a huge improvement in viewing videos or getting a glance for quick info (weather, news highlights, time, etc.).• With smart screen layout, I can see this fit for security cams and baby monitors. I have a Ring camera on my door, and this works like a charm if I need to see who at the door.• Saying “Alexa, start my day.” Is a pretty cool experience if you spend the time customizing what you want to see and hear, from Alexa, when getting out of bed, You can have a very modern morning cycle.• Taking and receiving phone calls is a real breeze. I here no static or break in communication when talking to my colleague. Note that I didn’t try WIFI calling international.• To summarize, you have 4 ways of communication: Message, Call, Drop-In, and Announce.• When playing Foo Fighters, the Show 8 does display the lyric alongside the song it’s playing, “The Pretenders.” One word for this, Karaoke!• Good speakers for music coming in the Show 5. It’s loud, which was a little surprising, given the size. Not enough for a house party, but enough for study or cooking time.Cons and Oks:__________• You can’t watch YouTube videos by using Alexa’s voice command. You have to physically go and type it in the web browser. Google owns YouTube and as of 2019, Amazon and Google are not the best in merging software. A major buzzkill because learning how to do something is what YouTube is made for.• Instead of YouTube, Alexa will bring you to Wiki videos. They’re very basic, not a significant amount in video inventory, and I was only able to access the intro videos. I wanted to know how to bake cookies and I needed to go to the screen and touch the next video for it to play. Wiki videos don’t give you the opportunity to cook “Binging with Babish” videos.• Beware of the advertisement for watching movies and shows. Amazon loves cutting 30% of the screen with advertisements. You need to be prepared for this experience because this is not going away.• Unlike Google’s Nest Hub, when you speak to Alexa, the device will not show you what you said. Alexa has messed up in what I said, yet I don’t know which word that caused the miscommunication.• I want to mention this again, NO SUPPORT FOR ANY GOOGLE SERVICES. To be honest, Google owns the internet (Photos, Drives, Nest Cameras, YouTube, etc.) and with this device, all the basic searches/videos you want require additional steps.• Want mapping directions to go to a place around your city? Stick to google maps on your smartphone because Alexa doesn’t do this.• The camera isn’t anything to brag about. It doesn’t have any advance HDR features, but then again it’s only for video calls.• Web typing on this is miserable. I just stick to my phone if I need to search for something really quick.• The bezel around the screen makes everything look smaller than it is. Its screen size does help reduce the feeling.• No real apps are useful, given the size.• Alexa is no Google Assistant. You have to speak in a specific syntax in order for Alexa to do what you want it to do. With simple demands, Alexa works like a charm. It’s when you start asking random questions that Alexa will say “Sorry, I’m not sure about that,” or something similar. Example: I said ""Alexa, show me dog videos"" and nothing happens but saying “Alexa, open Prime Video,” it opens right away. Very specific on what you need to say.• No USB port to charge your phone. This Show, to me, is more for public viewing, the center of attention. A USB port would’ve been great not only to charge your phone, but to input pictures, videos, and even recipes into the Show.• When you start getting used to the Show 8, turn off Alexa tips. Having that feature on will clutter the screen by default. You have a small screen and yet the Show 8 wants to put as much as it can on it.• When streaming music from my iPhone to the Show 8 (using Bluetooth) the music isn’t clear as it’s plagued with Bluetooth artifacts. I have to assume this is a software issue, so it may be resolved in the near future updates. Still, I think you should know.• There is some lag on the touch screen. Tapping on a back button I have to wait 2-3 seconds before it follows with my request.• Want to move it around, you need to pay for the viewing angle attachment because you can’t adjust viewing angles without it.• The screen maybe a little too bright when it’s dark in the room.• The Show 8 doesn’t have any Dolby features, which makes the volume for music loud, but not clear. Playing acoustic songs are fine but playing anything other complex songs (Foo Fighters, Lady Gaga) distorts the quality of the song.• There are a lot of steps to just do a simple task. I wanted to pick my preferred source images and had to go through Settings, Home &amp; Clock, Clock, and finally to Personal Photos. A lot of steps for such a simple task.Bottom Line:__________Of the Echo Show and Echo Show 5, this is the best one out on the market. The two things that make this the best between the three is the screen and the privacy layout. The screen is large enough that watching videos wasn’t a hazel, and the manual buttons for privacy are a must in this day in age. It’s a very nice design and I see this as something you will have in the kitchen of all places.The Show 8 does a lot of decent work, but it also has numerous other features that it isn’t the best at due to software issues. The resolution isn’t mind-blowing, as it’s something to either play music, or even a movie, in the background while you work. This is no replacement for a screen to watch for 2 hours as it’s more for a quick 5 minutes here and there. This is why I see this for the kitchen as it’s a great place to follow cooking videos. Anywhere else I feel it would not be put into use enough to be worth the cost.Also, I advise everyone to take a look at the Google Nest Hub, Lenovo and the rest of the Echo Show smart system. The truth is, for a universal home smart system, this isn’t it. The Google Nest’s software is top of the line in communication and user interface. The Show 8’s main highlights are privacy, video calls, smart house function, and the price. With the price you’re getting it’s a nice system to screen ratio, but if you’re not fully on board in the Amazon world you’ll be restricted in so many ways that sometimes it’ll be quicker to just take out your smartphone.Overall: The best of the three Echo’s, but most useful in the kitchen or at your desk."
No full screen clock mode.GIVE US A FULL SCREEN CLOCK.  Why oh why Amazon does not provide the same clock options as a Show 5 or Spot does for the Show 8 baffles my mind.  1 star until that is fixed.
"Get something else.I was lured in by the good price on Black Friday, but I can’t recommend this device. Unlike some of the reviews suggest there is no way to turn off the things to try message which constantly appears at the bottom of the screen. I’m unable to select most of my Facebook albums, and the weather forecast does not stay - rather it rotates on and off.Overall this device accomplished nothing notable, I would not recommendEdit: an amazon employee named Kristina reached out about some of my concerns which I do appreciate and took some of my feedback. She confirmed that there is no way to turn off the things to try prompt but told me that it was a common feedback. While there is no published limit in the number of Facebook albums that it supports I found that after about 50 it stops looking which meant I had a lot of old albums to select from but nothing recent. The weather app can be selected as the only card but it doesn’t stay up, it appears for 30 seconds or so then Disappears for 30s and the cycle continues. Overall the physical quality of this device is quite good but the software lacks any sort of customization to the point that you pretty much get a stock experience out of the box. My original point stands that this device doesn’t really accomplish anything despite being well made"
"Great device except for one fatal flaw.This is a terrific device except for one flaw that ruins it:  A message displays at the bottom of the screen ""Try Alexa ....."" giving instructions on different ways to use the device.  For example, this message is displaying on my Show right this moment:  ""Try Alexa, show movies with Emma Watson"".There is NO WAY to turn off the constant display of these messages.  When Googling about this, I see hundreds of customers have already complained to Amazon about this problem. But Amazon refuses to give customers a way to remove this instrusive screen display.  Apparently Amazon thinks its customers are all 10-years old and need a constant on-screen display of instructions.This ""Try Alex ...."" is also a form of advertising, albeit advertising of Amazon's products.Until Amazon removes this display (or gives customers the choice of removing it), I strongly suggest buying a different company's product.  Google sells similar products.  So does Apple.  Neither company treats its customers with such contempt.UPDATE:  After submitting this review, I found a solution.  I wrapped a piece of black electrical tape around the bottom of the screen, positioned to hide the ""Alexa try ..."" messages, but not hide anything else.  The result looks great.  Those annoying messages no longer ruin the photos (or anything else) on my screen.  The only downside to this solution is it makes the screen slightly smaller.  But it's better to have a smaller screen that looks decent than to have a larger screen completely ruined by those messages.  I still recommend buying a different company's product.  It is ridiculous that the only way to block those messages is to cover the screen with electrical tape."
"Mickey mouse design.Who designed this thing? I do not need a billboard by my nightstand, please remove the ""Things to try"" and provide a full screen clock. Give me a break."
"Echo Show is barely usable today, but does have potential.  Software not ready for ""Prime Time"" yet.The Echo Show is barely usable, yet has great potential.I say this because I wanted a nice Clock/iHeartRadio/Calendar/Weather Forecast/Voice Control for home automation device for my desk.  The Echo Show fails to provide these services...seamlessly.  Each of my requirements can be individually met, but not together.  Let me explain: If you are listening to iHeartRadio, then you cannot see the clock/weather/etc...  The BASIC function of what time it is does not work if you are listening to a radio stream.  The iHeartRadio app takes total control of your display, NO ROTATION of other apps.  There goes the clock.  Further, the font for the clock is not configurable.  Epic Fail for those with less than perfect vision.  The ability to customize this product to my desires/needs is why I rate this product as being barely able to be sold as an automation product.  To add insult, Amazon runs hints across the bottom of the screen: Try ""Alexa, open ....""  This is nothing but annoying SPAM!  You cannot disable this ""feature"".  I own most of the Echo product line and threw out the Google products because even with all of Echo's short comings it's still better than Google.  If you think that the Harmony product line integration with Echo is good, you are wrong.  Again, barely crosses the line of usability.  Example, you cannot set up a voice command to execute a single IR button (ie. arrow up, arrow down, etc..).  I have installed high end automation equipment in my house (Crestron) and compare this product with decent home automation.  Echo is not ready for ""prime time"" yet, has great potential...eventually...hopefully."
"alexa, quit showing me suggestions!!!!!!!Update - There are reviewers out there who claim you can turn off the suggestions.  When I first go the device I went to the ""Home and Clock"" settings, turned EVERYTHING off, and I still get the alexa suggestions all the time.  One person also claims to have a full-screen clock displayed.  When my review was posted, I received a phone call from an amazon support person, and he agreed there is NO way to turn off the alexa suggestions and he also agreed there is NO way to display a full-screen clock.-------------------------------------------------------------I have the show5 and I really like it.  I have turned off the notifications but I still get the annoying alexa suggestions at the bottom of the screen.  On the show5, at least the alexa suggestions are in small print and I can pretend they are not there as I enjoy my large clock.  On the show8, all you get is a small clock in the upper left corner - no way to change it and since the screen is bigger, the mandatory alexa suggestions are in bigger font.  The good news - it was up and running in about 2 minutes and amazon music sounds good on it.  The bad news is, do I really want to keep it?  I really like the large clock face on the show5 and it seems ridiculous I have NO clock options on the show8."
"Software issues &amp; needs more options !!Just received my Echo Show 8, set up was basically the same as an Echo Show 5, however, there is differences when it comes to the menu and options, I liked the addition of optional photos to chose from but the option to have the day/date on the screen is gone, who would do that, also there is no options for making the time fonts bigger/smaller.  Would be nice also if you could change the font colors. The speed at which the pictures rotate is much to fast, at least for me, maybe more options would be nice like an hour or 2-3-4 or even as long as a day, have a different picture every morning.  The size is nice but without being able to enlarge the fonts .. well .. would be nice for people that can't see real well. Overall I like it but needs some fine tuning as far as options especially for the price.  Another thing is I really don't need Alexa telling me to try and do things all day long I mean come on, how about an opt out button.Update;  12/12/2019I had two brand new Echo Show 5's that got sent back for fixing after dealing/chatting with Amazon customer service several times over a two week period because picture rotation would freeze along with a couple other glitches that occurred now and then and got sent back two refurbished/renewed Show 5's, my point here is that my brand new Echo Show 8 is doing the exact same thing, so instead of going through the whole customer service fiasco again I'm just returning it while I still can and not getting another one.  Another thing I noticed that I disliked after using it for a few days was when you set a timer the numbers are nice and big with a count down, but after just a couple seconds the timer shrinks down to where you'd have to be inches away to read it.Maybe, just maybe when gen-2 Echo 8 comes out I may revisit it, but they need to make some major changes."
"Irritating Messages.This would be a great product, except for the annoying and persistent messages for ""things to try"" across the bottom half of the screen. I'd love to be able to rate this higher, but with the annoying messages that you can't get rid of, I realize I should have bout a Google product."
"It's a scaled down Echo Show, not a scaled up Show 5.Has the standard Alexa/Show functionality - as you would expect - and they work fine.BUT:- The screen continues to rotate thru  Echo ""Try ..."" prompts ,even with all settings disabled. Terribly annoying.- Was hoping to make this a big Clock - like you can with the Show 5 - NOPE.  - The clock has fewer options  - The clock digits are actually smaller than the Show 5.End of the day, if you just want this to be a clock, you end up with a smallish clock in the upper left corner of the display and continually rotating ""Try ..."" prompts at the screen bottom. Big dissapointment."
"Very good addition, but needs option for Big Clock.Replaced my Echo Spot with the Show 8.  Very nice screen resolution and easy to use.  I like the streaming video available as well as the standard Echo features.  My one disappointment is the lack of ability to change the clock look.  I should be able to have a large clock display over most of the screen or other cool features, but right now only a small display in one corner.  Hopefully this will be resolved in a future update."
"MAKE THE AMBIENT CLOCK BIGGER!!I love the Echo Show 8. The only thing I hate the most is the SMALL DIGITAL CLOCK!! Why would you put such a small clock on a bigger screen! When the Echo Show 8 goes into ambient mode the clock is in the corner!! Lol. I hope you update this to a BIGGER CLOCK!! If not I'll send it back and be happy with the Echo show 5. Sound is great! Picks up my voice better than the show 5. I'm using an extra stand from my show 5 and I don't know if I'll need a stand right now. Please stop displaying ask Alexa this or try this on my screen. I don't want to see that stuff! Should be able to just display things I want to see!! It works great with my Wyze Cameras and all my WiFi lights. The sound is really really good!! Way better than the Echo Show 5. I can't stand the clock is so small! I had friends looking in the manual and online for a way to make that clock biggie! I hope I mentioned the ambient clock enough, so it gets stuck in your head's!! PLEASE UPDATE THE AMBIENT CLOCK! I wish I can change the color of the clock. I have until January 31 to return it. Get moving on some updates!"
"OMG Amazon please turn off the stupid things to try That is now on the wallpaper non stop.I got this primarily to use as a digital picture frame in my living room and it does a great job of scrolling thru my pictures and they display beautifully.  However, it puts the annoying things to try at the bottom of every single picture and is ruining it as a digital picture frame.  People have been begging Amazon for years too stop doing this and they keep ignoring it. I have turned off continuous scroll, Discovery,  and every other setting I could find and it is still there. This is infuriating.  I mean really, by now, most people know how to use their alexa devices, so why do they think this is necessary?!?! It makes no sense that they should force this on everyone .  I have an echo spot and even a show 5 that I was able to get it to at least only show it once, but on the 8 they apparently decided it should be a part of the wallpaper itself. You also can't adjust the clock size or position like you can on the show 5. There is nothing worse than looking at pictures of your beautiful children with the stupid things to try at the bottom."
"Disappointing.I have the Show 5 as my bedside clock. I also have horrible vision. I bought this thinking I could have a larger clock than I do on the 5, but nope. The option to make it a big clock and fill up almost the entire screen, as you are able to do on the 5, is not an option on this. Disappointing, to say the least."
"Discount (updated).Not very cool, offer a pre-sale for $30 off and a week later reduce it another $20, not nice at allUpdate, changing from 1 star to 5. Amazon did me right, totally unexpected. Thanks Amazon"
"Video functionality doesn't measure up.Context: I'm very ""Alexified."" Two full-size Echos, a Dot, a 4K Firestick, and now a Show 8. Various household smart devices including lighting, smart plugs, and a thermostat. So, I'm technically knowledgeable and happy in the Alexa/Amazon universe. A friend has a Show 5, and I wanted a new device in my kitchen, to replace the Dot, which was connected to (i.e., plugged into) a better speaker. Along came the Show 8 (the friend told me he was going to replace his 5 with the 8). Reviews indicated that the sound was good (it is; at least as good as my previous wired speaker). I was concerned about the negative reviews about the clock and the ""Try . . "" notifications, but some reviews said you could change the options in Settings (and in case you want to know up front, those reviews are incorrect; you can't). So here goes with the rest of my review:Pro's:--Easy to set up, especially if you already have other Alexa devices.--Good sound for such a small device.--Functions just as well as my other Echo devices. Except -- this is a *video* device, and that's where it falls short.--Price and Delivery: I got this on the Black Friday sale (actually on Thanksgiving Day itself) for $50 off. Delivery was projected for Monday, but it was delivered in two days. Can't complain about any of that -- but, given the Con's I'm about to list, I wouldn't pay full price for it.Con's:--The clock. You can't alter the font or format. You can't opt for a full-screen clock. I realize for some people this is not an issue, but I'm nearsighted and wear glasses with progressive lenses. At the bottom and middle of my lenses (reading- and mid-distance) the clock numerals are out-of-focus from across the room. I wish you could set up a home screen with a large-numeral clock, but you can't.--Kitchen use, i.e., for me, mainly the timer. The countdown numerals appear when you start the timer, but then disappear as the screen rotates through its content. It would be nice to just look at the screen and see how much time is left, but you have to ask Alexa the question (just as I had to do with my Dot).--The ""Try this and that ..."" text across the bottom of the screen. You can't get rid of it. Yes, I read one review (which, at the moment Amazon is featuring as its ""Most Helpful""). This review says you can go into various sub-menus of Settings, and make it go away. I tried those suggestions. They don't work.So, I'd say, be warned, especially when the Show 8 goes back to full price. The Show 8 needs a software update that allows changes to the clock, the ""Try this..."" messages, and other functions.  It saves space on my kitchen counter, compared to my former Dot-plus-external speaker, but its potential advantages as a video device are either not realized or else compromised."
"For the whole family.Set it up today. It set itself up in mins. Music sounds great. 9th echo device in our home. Setup a device group and play music everywhere. Works great with ring as well since we have no peephole in the door.  Made a custom album on Amazon photos, added as wallpaper. Placed it kitchen."
"Alexa keeps saying “something went wrong”.I am so disappointed in my Echo Show 8. Setup went really well. I have extremely fast internet. In the middle of her introduction to the features of The Echo Show 8, Alexa starting speaking in a loop and couldn’t answer any questions or execute any commands. After over an hour with Tech Support, Alexa is still unresponsive. Boo! Hiss!  Not a good introduction to the Echo Show 8.UPDATE: if your Echo Show 8 has the problem I described above, unplug it and let it sit for a few hours. I tried this and when I plugged it back in, Alexa was able to work as she is supposed to. Frustrating at first but turned out okay."
"Worst mistake possible. Terrible firmware.How Amazon thinks people will tolerate a device which force them to watch things on the screen all of the time that we do not want to ever see is amazing.Maybe they'll get the message that thousands of people are complaining about the same thing,  I wish I'd seen the complaints and poor reviews before hand.  I want to set this so nothing shows on the screen except the time in big numbers.  None of the THINGS TO TRY constantly changing and annoying us.This will be going back unless someone at Amazon tells me that new firmware is coming that will allow us to configure our devices to our needs.  Think of how many people would be upset if every few minutes your none display echo units would ANNOUNCE THINGS TO TRY that you could hear while doing other things.DO NOT BUY THIS UNLESS YOU ARE CONTINENT TO LET AMAZON CONTROL WHAT YOU SEE."
"My son loves it.My son loves the 8 inch Amazon Show.My wife has the the 5 inch show in our bedroom.I have the 10 inch show in my home office.Needi I say more we love the Amazon Show for sure.I was surprise on how good the 8 inch show sound was, great price.The only problem I have we need more names for our units, and maybe we can name our units ourselves.I also have 4 Echo Dots and one car unit."
"It's pretty good but there are some things I'm not a fan of.So I got the Echo Show 5 early Nov 2019 as the Echo Show 8 wasn't going to be released until the end of the month and I needed a new Bedside alarm clock.  While I did like it, I felt it was too small for my needs.  The Echo 8 finally got released and so I sent this one back and ordered the Echo 8.  It was easy enough to do a Return and order this in its place.  So Amazon is great there.So I've included some pictures while I had both the 5 and 8 at the same time.  You can see the 8 on the left and the 5 on the right.  Front view and side view along with it in the dark.  I also included a short Video where you can see them side by side with the light on in the room and then what happens when I turn the light off.I do like the 8"" Echo Show better.  The biggest issue I have is the size of the TIME.  Look at this side by side.  They are the SAME SIZE!!!  Look at all that wasted screen space.  I got the 8 so I'd have a larger clock.  But in a bright room, look at the SMALL time in the top left corner.  Look at the picture in the dark. The clocks are the same size, but the 5"" one is in the middle of the screen, and the 8"" once is up on the top left.  Looks at that black screen and a huge amount of wasted space!!!!  Why is this?  It's almost made getting the 8"" screen pointless.The other thing is the line on the bottom where it shows you things you can ask Alexa.  There seems to be no way to turn it off.  I've turned pretty much everything OFF and yet it's still there.  If you were using this 8"" as a picture frame, which you can do and have it cycle through pictures, great, then maybe a small clock on the screen is a good thing?  But with an all-black screen, what is the point then?I like that you can easily block the camera on both the 5 and 8 as you can see in the picture the camera is blocked and I have ZERo plans to ever use those.  Both can hear me just fine.  I can tell it when to set an alarm and it does it easy enough.  In the morning I can just say ""Alexa Snooze"" and it'll snooze for 10 minutes.  It hears me just fine.  It can play my Apple Music.  I do have a couple of Apple Homepods that sound better.  I could use them as an alarm, etc.  But I wanted a screen I could just peek at.  Apple has no other options.  I'm not using my iPad as an Alarm clock.Amazon needs to update this 8"" version to better work with this larger screen. Or at least have an option to have a larger clock on the screen.  Also at first when its night mode, the screen had this black background glow I didn't like where the 5"" version didn't.  Luckily I was able to adjust the brightness down just a bit which cured that issue.  Now I have a completely black screen except for the time.  The time is also not very bright.  It's not lighting up my room which is a good thing."
"Needs Work.There are many things I like about this. However, 1 major thing is such a significant drawback that I feel weighs all the otherwise positive aspects out. That is, the constant, “Try Alexa,........” at the bottom of the home screen. It cant be turned off and it incredibly annoying.  It also seems to be something that has been around for past generations and I am absolutely baffled as to why."
Review that is currently “most helpful” for this product is wrong.  “Things to try”.When I saw the reviews for this device and saw there was an argument about if you could turn off the “things to try” and the “most helpful” review by far was saying that “things to try” COULD be turned off I figured that it could be turned off and i should still buy the product. (I bought 3)  After spending 1 hour I can confirm the “most helpful” review here is completely false and “things to try” cannot be turned off in any way.  The most helpful review here should be removed as it is incorrect.  Also “things to try” is much more annoying than I thought it would be.
Echo Show 8.I like everything about this except for two things. You need the option to make the clock bigger if needed and be able to see the day's date.  Hopefully they will fix this in an update and if they do it would be a 5 star rating for me.
"Software makes it close to useless.I bought this to take the spot of my Show 5 in my bedroom.  With the Show 5 I could barely read the clock face across the room and there is no option to make the clock take up the entire screen.I figured 3 extra inches from the Show 8 would make the clock big enough to see.  Imagine my surprise when I found it is impossible to customize the clock face in Show 8 settings.  The closest I came to what I need is a dark screen with a tiny clock in the bottom left corner.  What is the point in that?There seems to be only one use case considered by Amazon, the user is right in front of the device.  If you see a positive review of this device, it's because the reviewer is using it in the kitchen or on their desk.  There is no consideration given for the across the room experience outside this being a photo frame.I sincerely hope Amazon gets their head out of their rear ends with this one.  I really feel like returning it.That said, hardware seems pretty nice.  It's just a bit ruined by the lack of customization and product vision on the software side.And for goodness sake, let people turn of ""Try this"" suggestions..."
"Home screen not fully customizable for users.A quality made product, however, if you don’t want to have the phrase:  “Try, Alexa..”. over your photos in a giant font don’t buy this product.  You are stuck with almost fullscreen print over your home screen and are not able to modify in the settings.  I called customer service and they told me it’s how it is.  I’m gonna keep mine though.  If you want to view full screen photos without amazon marketing over at least 1/3 and often more than 1/3 of the screen you need to verbally tell Alexa every time you use it to display photos.  Apple are more expensive for a reason because the end user is not forced into how to customize the product.  One does get used to it a little but then it ends up coming full screen printed font over your favorite photo and it reminds you why amazon sells you the product for so little.Dear Amazon, please let the users change be homescreen settings to not include the Alexa suggestions, and also please do not contact me regarding this revied.  Change the firmware and then I will pull down the review.It’s a fun gadget and has a nice screen and good sound quality for its size, which is great for photos but you need to tell Alexa 20 times a day to display them manually if you want to see them fullscreen as it’s not a setting you can change."
"Completely Useless.TLDR: If you’re under the age of 70, don’t waste your money on this.The only thing this gives you that you don’t get through an echo dot is information that you probably already have on the home screen of your phone, and doesn’t take advantage of the touch screen AT ALL. I wrongly assumed I would be able to at least see my smart home devices from the echo show screen and perhaps even turn lights on and off without having to use voice commands, but nope. Not even the most basic and obvious features were thought out for this garbage device. Seriously, for the same price you can get an echo dot, kindle fire, and a better-sounding Bluetooth speaker and would have MUCH more functionality available to you.If you don’t own a smart phone and want an overpriced clock that can also play muddied music and video from amazon’s library through a $15 subwoofer... then this is perfect for you. For anyone else, avoid like the plague."
"Amazon Devices are getting worse in quality over the years.This echo show is not worth it. the only upgrade over my older echo dot is the screen. but the screen comes with its own disadvantages. hate the ""try skills"", more advertising than real use. cant switch off the feature. the sound quality is about the same.update: i got the echo show during black Friday. following Tuesday amazon started advertising the echo show ships with a free echo dot for the same price, i called back to see if i get that and they said i need to cancel send it back and reorder. my card will be charged and then refunded...i feel amazon polices are going downhill every passing day.update: i regret trading echo spot. echo spot could control my firetv. echo can not do that."
"No way to turn off annoying ads.Will change from 1 star to five once they make it so that we can remove the ""try, alexa"" annoying suggestions at the bottom of the screen. How this is not an option baffles me. Really really bad programmers..."
"Annoying “try this” messages can’t be shut off.“Try” this, Amazon: maybe ask some real people to use the thing before you ship it. I bought this for my in laws looking for a nice simple thing they could see and say “Alexa” to, and instead we got a slot machine that can’t stop stop making suggestions and flashing things at them. Why can’t it just show a clock (at a reasonable size) without relentless “try this” messages? Make that change and I’d give it 4+ stars as it’s otherwise what I was looking for."
"Clock too small.When the 8 can do the same things the 5 can, I will buy one.  I love my 5, so I said self, an 8 would be even better.  But I was wrong.  I like the size of it, and the heft of it, I can't push it across my night stand, but the clock font is way too small and even more dumb it can't be adjusted.  It's awkwardly positioned in the upper left hand corner, making it difficult to see, and there is no date on the home screen any more.  The 5 is but better suited to me.  Had to return unfortunately.  Please give us the option to use and customize the whole screen , not a just a tiny percentage.  I would give this a xeyedjohn do not recommend if you want to use this to tell time and wake up with."
"product OK - watch out for trade-in deal...This product is OK - does what it is supposed to.However - watch out for the trade-in deal!  I was quoted $25 for my gen 1 echo - shipped them a perfectly working unit - no scratches, no blemishes and they then gave me $5 and charged my card $20.  It's a scam, plain and simple.  Seriously disappointed in Amazon.  They do not allow you to put a review up on the process and when I clicked on the reason I was down-graded all it states is ""yes.""  Terrible job Amazon."
"Great sound and screen is very easy to read.I have several Show 5's and am really excited about this 8"" model.  I have put mine in the living room and it makes a huge improvement in sound/music playing (as compared to the 5 which I already thought was really good) .  I had read it uses the same speakers as the larger Show 10 model.  I also have several of the Ring cams which are easily view able.  Another must have device from Amazon added to my home."
"Our 35r Alexa device and very pleased.Have an Echo Dot and a Yamaha sound system with built-n Alexa, but our new Echo Show is really slick and our hands-down favorite.  Sharp color display and good sound quality. The 8"" display is just right size for an average size room - big enough to see easily without taking up too much space.  We've also just added a video security camera and the SHOW is excellent for real time display or stored video playback."
"diffrent software than the ES5.The ES8 is a nice unit but it would be nice if Amazon could make it possible to get rid of the Try Alexa ----on the bottom. One reviewer said to go to home and clock then home content and then turn off Discovery. That's not quite correct for the ES8, that is how you get rid of the Try Alexa on ES5 not the 8. There is no Home and Clock, the 8 has a wallpaper and clock and right below that is the home content where you find discovery, and you can turn it off until you turn blue in the face, it will not cancel the Try Alexa. Maybe I have a different ES8 or Amazon posted the review for the wrong Echo Show. The second difference from the es5 is the clock. You have one setting. Overall the ES8 is a nice unit, just wish Amazons software department would have kept some of the features the 5 has. I'm just hoping they can send out some updates to fix these glitches."
"Not Good, but the ""Suggestions "" Are a Non-issue.First impression - not impressed. There is much, much room for improvements with this device. I'll say that the ""suggestions"" at the bottom of the screen are a non-issue for us, I can't imagine why this bothers some people as much as it does. Frankly, I never notice them on my Fire TVs or this Echo. Pros are good sound, and everything as far as smart home device control goes. Having had an Echo in the house since the beta edition, we have added many bulbs and a thermostat that the Echo Show works well with. The cons are too many and too important. a) It has Hulu, but no Netflix. It is the only device I know of that can't get Netflix. The only video options it has are NBC (wow), Hulu, Food Channel if you pay for the service, Tubi and Prime video.  One out of 5 is not bad, would love to have more options there. b) The inability to add any apps. If I could put SlingTV on this, I wouldn't care about the Netflix. Adding Plex would give me access to my own server of content. c) YouTube looks awful. You can ask Alexa to do a YouTube search and you get all these tiny thumbnails in one column that runs down the left side while the majority of the screen is left unused, just white wasted space. I've tried both browsers and they both look like this. The YouTube app would help here. d) Fingerprints on the screen are VERY noticeable and take away from the picture quality. I believe that after any initial setting up I won't be touching it too much anyway. e) When I'm using the screen for viewing something and I tell Alexa to turn off a light, it goes to a very useless/annoying screen showing a light bulb with a slider next to it... and it stays there 15 seconds or so. Meanwhile, I'm missing my other thing I was watching. Why would it do this? I've obviously just displayed the fact that I can control the light with my voice, why would I now need a second option for the light adjustments for my finger?? This alone is a deal breaker!! f) So far, I have not been able access all of the content that I get on my Kindle. I push many recipes and other Docs to my Kindle and can see that content on any device that runs the Kindle app....until now. I can see my books, but not my Docs/Collections. Did not see that coming. Now for recipes I'm seeing that I need to sign up with AllRecipes.com and send recipes there to easily access them with the Echo Show.It seems to me, to get the most out of this, I need to conform to Amazon's way and not mine. Get an allrecpies account, sign up with Hulu. Or if I buy a Ring doorbell I can see a camera view. On my FireTV and Kindle tablets I am able to access all of my security cameras with the installation of a single app. I just received the Show yesterday and I will look to see if I can make this thing more useful for my needs, I honestly haven't spent that much time with it. Maybe I can find some answers to my concerns. In the past, while I'm in the kitchen, I have just stood my Kindle Fire 8 tablet on the counter, I'll probably go back to doing that. The tablet has more functionality, all the apps, all my Kindle content and and it's portable. I'm going to update this review in a couple of days. By then, I will have decided if the Show has to go.UPDATE: This thing is going back. I've tried what I would think should be simple tasks, it fails. I tried to setup an album in Prime photos for changing backgrounds. It's been on the same photo for several hours although the album has 209 photos in it. I say Play a Slideshow of that album or any album. It shows 4 or 5 pics and goes back to the home screen. Also, it appears there's no way to shuffle the albums - why not? Fire TVs allow the slideshows to shuffle. I tried to see my security cams using the Monocle skill. I can now call them up with Alexa on my Fire TVs, but not the Show. I looked further into the Allrecipes skill - it's the worst. As someone said it's better to have Alexa find recipes on the web.I have many Alexa enabled devices, but this by the far the most useless. Most of the positive reviews seem to be impressed with the things that need no screen - play music, control devices and lights. The screen has little to no functional use. Perhaps if this had been my first Alexa I would be more impressed. The show will have to go."
"As of 12/9/19, Reviews stating Things to Try can be removed are WRONG!12/9/19I ordered the Show 8 based on reviews that said the ""Things to Try"" chryon could be disabled via the settings menu. As it turns out, that was incorrect information as has now been confirmed by Amazon customer support, as well as my own personal experience. I hope Amazon will listen to their customers and offer an option to disable this device behavior. Similar to an unsubscribe or opt-out of email setting, Amazon could offer a frequency option  (turn off, once a month, weekly, daily, hourly, on continuously). This one behavior truly ruins an otherwise good experience. If this is corrected, this device would earn 4-5 stars no question.Pros: Good sound, bright display, nice form factor, looks nice on the kitchen counter where I have it placed. Nice to have lyrics display while music is playing, local content is appreciated, good microphones, and I like the ability to see my cameras in the screen and the ability to view my home automation control (browser), physical camera shutter for privacy.Cons: Inability to turn off ""Things to Try"" is annoying, the optional stand should be less expensive, it could use more user options for what is displayed and how, and with Amazon having their own Silk browser, we should be able to at a minimum use voice to launch the browser with a saved bookmark. (e.g. ""Alexa, open bookmark My Favorite Website in Silk""  or better yet a routine that can open websites, so we could use natural language of our choosing, ""Alexa, show me XYZ."" .  Eventually, it would be nice to have natural language voice and/or gesture controlled browsing. Personal preference, I wish the closed shutter was more subtle (e.g. dark red or gray dot VS white on the black Echo show)"
"A review from someone who has owned every Echo Show device...Amazon had produced some great Echo show devices but they still haven't grasped the idea of how to make this the optimal user experience.My first Echo Show was the original 5"" model introduced in 2017.  I was one of the first to purchase this and three years later, it still performs admirably.Since then, Amazon has introduced a massive 10"" model, a smaller 5"" model and now this 8"" model.I have bought all of them.My absolute favorite is the 10"" model.  If you have RING cameras in your home or you want to use this as a photo frame that will continuously show your photos linked to your Amazon Photo account, this is the only model you should be considering.  Yes, it costs more, but the extra real-estate makes a big difference.I bought the 5"" model to use as a bedside clock.  However, it was too small.  I went with this 8"" model to use as a bedside clock, though despite user recommendations on how to make it work, it doesn't operate as a full-sized clock.  The digits are minimalized to one of the corners of the screen.I am now looking at the Lenovo clock as that 5"" made specifically as a bedside smart clock display.But getting back to the 8"" Echo Show...It's a terrific unit with a beautiful screen and it absolutely is a compromise between the smaller and larger models.The problem is, it still operates the same as it did back in 2017.  There doesn't seem to be any software revisions that make the Echo Show a better user experience.For instance, no matter what you turn off, the display is always showing a rotating list of things to try.  It may be helpful at first, but it's annoying after a while.Want a news feed displayed to your screen?  You really can't personalize the kind of news that you want.  In essence, this is the heart of the problem concerning the Amazon Echo Show experience.  You can't personalize this device to display the kind of content YOU want.  All the content is generalized.  You can't make this device show you any more personalized content than your next-door neighbor can.  It conveys generic news content at its best.You would think that after all these years, Amazon would have learned to make this a device that really works for you.  While you can go into the app and make traffic reports more personalized according to your work address, you really can't do anything more tailored to your needs.  Want specific news feeds or even your personal stock results updated on the screen?  You are completely out of luck.I have the Google Nest hubs as well.  I do like the Amazon ecosystem better, though there are some things that Google does better.  You can carry on a conversation with the Google Hubs.  You can't with Amazon.  You can use the hub with Nest cameras doorbells.  I can't do that with Amazon.  On the other hand, you can't view Ring cameras or doorbells on Google.  This fierce competition only serves to hurt the end-user who is forced to buy into both platforms to use all these devices.Where Amazon Echo and all its related devices clearly win is with the number of plug-ins available for it.  There are many really cool skills that you can add through the app to make Echo even more amazing.I really like the 8"" but overly disappointed that it's not designed as a bedside clock no matter what settings have already been suggested to use.  If I were new to these Echo devices and deciding upon the very first one I would want to purchase, I would go for the 10"" model -- especially if using cameras or showing off photos."
"Software downgrade from Show 5.We had a Show 5 in the kitchen and purchased the Show 8 primarily for the larger screen. While we are happy with the screen size we are decidedly not happy with the software implementation. It is in some ways a downgrade from the Show 5. Many reviewers have stated the same issues we have. First, unless we are fairly close to the Show 8 we cannot see the clock in the upper left hand corner. Unlike the the Show 5, there are no templates with a simple monochrome background and a large font clock in the center.  Second, there is no displayed date. Third, there is no way to turn off the ""Try Alexa""  displayed  at the bottom of the screen. If these issues were addressed in an update we would raise our review to five stars."
"“Try Alexa” that cannot be shut off is too obnoxious.I’m contemplating returning it, the “try Alexa” feature sucks and cannot be turned off."
"For being customer centric in every other way, things to try is disappointing...I really can’t understand why Amazon won’t allow people to turn off the things to try message.  We have a fairly comprehensive Alexa network of devices and this is my major pain point.  It’s ridiculous.  I debated rating it higher, but i don’t think amazon will get the message unless customers speak loud enough."
"Yes this is incredibly annoying.So I read the comments before I purchased it stating that the ""Try, Alexa ...."" messages can't be removed from the screen.  Honestly I thought that was wrong.  But nope you really can't remove these messages.  They are on the bottom of every screen.  It is unbelievably annoying.  You think you should get use to it but you don't.There are complaints all over the web about this yet Amazon has done nothing.  Amazon if you read these messages let me give you a tip.  These messages don't make me more likely to use services they make me less likely.  I don't read the messages, I try to ignore them.Since Amazon is disregarding the input from users, the only option is to not buy the device and return the ones bought for a refund until Amazon adds the ability to turn these messages off.  Nobody buys a screen to be forced to watch ads.  Amazon if these messages truly added value then customers will leave them enabled on their screen.  The fact that you don't provide an option to turn them off indicates you realize they don't add value.I'm returning mine I suggest everyone simply think twice before you purchase one.  It truly is frustrating beyond belief that there is no way to disable these messages from the home screen."
"Half baked.Show 8 is a downgraded version of show 5 with a bigger screen. The display is not customizable like show 5. Looks like  Amazon product development team was rushed to launch something to beat google hub, but terribly failed.  The fonts are so big and unappealing. You don't have ability to customize anything in show 8 compared to Show 5."
"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!I eagerly awaited the Echo Show 8 because I was generally pleased with the Echo Show 5. Like everyone else, I didn't like the try whatever crap at the bottom of the screen, but the large clock with date was nice. So, I thought I'd upgrade to the larger screen. HUGE MISTAKE!! The Show 8 is not like the Show 5. It WILL NOT display a large clock with the date AT ALL. What were you thinking Amazon? It's bad enough you're not responding to user complaints with the try whatever garbage in every screen. Now you took away the clock? EPIC FAIL!! I would NOT recommend the Show 8 to anyone. Time to start looking at what the competition offers. Better get on the software updates quick Amazon or you'll find people will go elsewhere for a more user friendly alternative."
"Nope.Can't stand the ""try"" pop ups at the bottom of the screen. I really don't give a rat's whatever about Leonardo DiCaprio movies or Whole Foods deals! Plus the clock is way too small and there's no way to enlarge it except to put the device in ""do not disturb"" mode. Then the clock is only slightly bigger. I wanted to like this.It's going back to Amazon."
"The best echo device!Great device. I am glad I waited for the 8 inch. Definitely worth it. If you can still get it for under $100, get one before prices go back up.  I like being able to see my Ring cam, listen to radio stations, Alexa even plays games.. so far my favorite is guessing the song..I tried 90s, 2000s, and 2010s. You can play with another so as well.  It’s like having a tablet without running on battery and a great loud speaker already attached. Only thing she can’t do is make me a ham sandwich lol."
"Incredibly disappointed with Alexa and Fire TV integration.EDIT: Just when you think it can't get worse... It does. I was cooking dinner tonight and had a timer set. Once the timer was up, I said, 'Alexa, stop' and then tried about 15 other different variations of this. Alexa thought I had no timers set on any devices and the timer continued to sound until I had to unplug the device and plug it back in.Also, yesterday while watching TV, I randomly started to experience some incredibly noticeable sound distortion on my Fire TV stick 4k. Once again, after trying every other possible solution, I had to restart the device....ORIGINAL REVIEW:Incredibly disappointed. This was one of EIGHT Fire TV and/or Echo devices that I purchased on Black Friday, hoping to switch from Roku TV and have a seamless smarthome experience. Oh boy, was I wrong.Whether I rename the the Fire TV devices or use their original names, the echo devices CANNOT control or recognize the tv devices, even after properly pairing them under the TV &amp; Video setting in the Alexa app. I've tried to unpair, repair, restart, unregister, reregister, you name it. I've wasted days.  Generally, Alexa responds with 'I cannot find a device named ...' I consider myself very technically savy and I'm positive this is not something that I'm doing wrong. I should've read more into this before buying. TONS of people all over the internet are having this problem. It's infuriating. Plain and simple, until problems like this are fixed, Amazon is blaintantly false advertising the way that their devices work.Other cons to note:-Multiple video apps stutter and sometimes even randomly pause without ever resuming unless you physically resume them.-Alexa drastically lowers the volume of the TV when you are voicing a command. This in-and-of-itself is not a huge problem. However, it becomes a problem often when after the command is complete, Alexa does not resume the original volume of the content. When this has happened, I've had to ask Alexa to turn the volume back up to the specific number it was at.-I have two third generation echos paired as a stereo system for the TV. Often, even though I have my fire TV set as the preferred device, only the echos hear my voice, and once again, because they cannot control the TV, they say that they cannot recognize the device and then I just have to pick up the controller anyway.-The Fire TV will often think that it hears an 'Alexa' when absolutely no where near that word has been stated. Because the volume lowers drastically when Alexa is listening, it creates an obnoxious volume dip in content to listen for nothing when this happens.-You cannot set a sleep timerHonestly I could go on and on about the cons and about just how unhappy I am about these products. There are even more problems than what I listed here, but I'm not wasting too much breath, as after doing days and days of research on these topics, I've seen that Amazon has absolutely no answers to these problems, even after thousands of people have reported the same problems over and over. Unless there is some revalatory software updated coming, I'll be returning hundreds of dollars of equipment."
Needs better apps.I like the new model. It's got a nice screen and sound.It's crazy that we still cant access things like pinterest or do a basic web search even.I ideally want to be able to get to recipies I want and not just allrecipies.com which are the only recipes you can search.
"Needs improvement.Having used an echo 5 for about 6 months, I was waiting for Black Friday pricing so I could ""upgrade"" to an echo 8, and replace my clock radio and dot on the night stand with the echo 5, and use the echo 8 in the living room with the larger screen.  Thinking the two devices would share a common software/user interface, I only glanced at a few of the reviews, and mentally wrote the negative ones off as likely operator error.  That proves to be a mistake.On the positive side, the screen is nice, the sound is better than the echo 5, and build quality appears good.On the negative side, the echo 5's interface and feature set is more desirable to me. I dislike that unless I upload a picture, the backgrounds on the echo 8 will rotate through a set of them. I want one background, and for it to stay that way. I also don't like the tiny clock in the upper corner. I was expecting at least an option to have a large clock in the center like the echo 5 has (old eyes). And I agree the rotating 'try this"" on the bottom of the screen is extremely annoying, and should at least be an option to turn off.It does interact with my smart home devices as the echo 5 did, so it will at least function for the primary purpose it serves for me. While I would give the echo 5 a 4 star review, I give the echo 8 a 3 star rating because it's just ""meh"", when I really should be gushing about how it's like the echo 5 on steroids, and not a poorly implemented, sort of, almost, copy of it with a bigger screen.TLDR: the other reviews are real,  it's not just a bigger screened echo 5."
"Great Device, Software needs updating.I purchased 4 Echo Show 8's and 1 Echo Show 5. Basically I am pleased but please give us an update for the Echo 8 which allows us to turn off the ""Try this"" at the bottom of the screen. Also, what's with the clock? The Echo 5 has more clock options. Why not an option for a large clock? These seem like easy software fixes. My wife wants me to return all of Echo Show's until these ""features"" are fixed. I am holding off for now since I do have confidence in Amazon. They can't ignore all of the negative feedback regarding the ""try this"" and clock issues, can they?Come on Amazon! Give us an update that addresses these issues."
"Not made for recipe function.Pros: The sound is great on this device and was easy to set up and sync with my other smart devices.Cons: The main one, and I almost sent it back due to it, is that it is difficult to get your own recipes on this. The main reason I purchased this echo was to have an easy way to pull up my recipes while cooking. The description says you can use the All Recipes skill, however they made it so you can’t sync to your All Recipes account. This makes it a pretty useless skill. I did find that there is a Sous Chef Recipe skill that is fairly basic looking, but easy to use."
Always wait for Black Friday!!I love my Echo Show 8! I should have waited a couple more days to order and I would have saved $20. Amazon doesn't do price adjustments on deal prices so always wait.
"Great disappointment. Does not perform the task I bought it for.A long awaited flop. I bought this to perform one task, that of ""show and tell"" .  As advertised this unit is supposed to be able to identify pantry items by holding them up and asking Alexa ""what am I holding ?"" Well it doesn't. I spent over 45 minutes talking to India and their techs who were very polite yet could not figure it out. My wife is legally blind and was so looking forward to this, as I had been hyping this feature for weeks. The second tech did however offer me a 15% discount on the Echo Show 10 which he assured me the feature would work. I can't send this back fast enough. Besides the fact that this seems like a tabletop billboard for Amazon with a banner of suggestions non stopping across the bottom of the screen. My worst purchase ever on Amazon, with the Fire tablet 10 that I also bought on Black Friday being a close second. Both items are going back."
"Solid device, exceeds expectations.I was expecting the screen size to be a bit too small but it's a good size.  HD screen is nice with crisp images and pictures.  Sound quality is pretty good too.  People complain about ""try Alexa"" on the home screen but there are a lot of customization options for what to show on the home screen - including the ability to turn those suggestions off.  Very happy with my purchase and will most likely be picking a few more up as Christmas gifts!"
"Couple things really bug me..Have to say I had higher expectations.  Will break down my review in a few parts noting that I have technically not received the product yet, however I did see the stand and played around with it at the Amazon store.  Here are a few things that bug me:1) Amazon's website says the item is out of stock and will take 2 weeks to deliver.  That's fine, until I drive 5 minutes to an Amazon store where they have piles of boxes of the Echo show 8 in both colors.  Why would Amazon's online store be out of stock when they have so many in stock so close by??2) The stand is REALLY not worth 20+ dollars.  I purchased as part of the bundle and still feel ripped off.  It doesn't swivel left and right, only goes up and down in a very uncomfortable way.  Honestly, the fact that it's a $20 piece of plastic that you absolutely need for this device to be visible is insane and Amazon is better than this.I will add more notes when I get a chance to review the functionality in more depth, on the surface it seems OK.  Same capabilities as all other Alexa devices + a screen to see stuff on.  Speakers are acceptable, screen quality is also acceptable."
"The screen makes it dumber....Constantly hangs on simple tasks. The 25 dollar 2nd gen dot works tons better. Sure, there’s a big screen. The try it stuff on the bottom isn’t that bothersome to me. It’s the fact that I tell it to turn on a light, and the blue band stays across the bottom of the screen like it’s waiting for me to say something else, then the band disappears, I get no response, like “ok”, and I get no lights on.I been using the dots for awhile, everything is set up, and works on the other dots. It’s like this device suffers from a case of the “stupids”. I think the screen is a niche thing that nobody really needs in an age of cell phones, and it makes the device worse by having it. I’m thinking the Show uses different firmware than the dot, and the show firmware is poorly done, which is actually a conservative review.Purchase at your own risk. Odds are you don’t need it if you have a smart phone with the Alexa app on it. If you insist, I’d wait it out a bit til the developers get their crap together on the software side of this. If you just want to control a plug or light, pick up a 2nd gen dot on the cheap."
"Almost perfect, but needs a couple of small tweaks.I really like this unit, and like one of the previous reviewer‘s has mentioned you can definitely do away with most of the Alexa suggestions by diving into the settings.There is one thing I wish they would do differently. On the echo five, there is a set of very attractive clock faces that can be chosen, but on this unit you can only choose a category such as art, travel etc. The echo will then choose random clock faces from that category to display. I would very much prefer having the ability to choose a clock face and stay on that one as opposed to having the unit choose various faces for me. For example on the echo show five there is an attractive nature scene with a lot of greenery and I would love to be able to put that same picture on the echo eight, but it’s unavailable.Additionally, we need a full screen clock option. Having a huge screen and relegating the clock to a small corner is not going to work for many of us.Other than these missing options it’s a winner, and I hope they will change the software soon to be able to allow for better clock face and display choices"
"I bought the Echo Show 8 thinking it would be a larger Echo Show 5... nope.If, like me, you thought the Echo Show 5 was fine (minus one glaring issue I'll get into later) but simply wanted a larger display to be able to see the time and temp across the room easier and thought that the Echo Show 8 would be exactly that... save your money.For some unknown reason the developers at Amazon decided that the clock &amp; temp display on the Echo Show 8 should only be able to take up a very small portion of the upper left-hand corner of the display.  This means that if you bought the Echo Show 8 to be able to see the clock easier due to it being larger you will actually get a smaller clock display.WuT?!Exactly.  Who at Amazon thought it would be a good idea to add code to limit the max size of the clock and temp on a device that costs more than the smaller version?  My eyes aren't even that bad but I can see how others with worse vision or possibly older people might prefer the larger display to be able to see the clock &amp; temp better.  Bamboozled!In addition, the constant need to ""advertise"" to paying customers that's present on the Echo Show 5 also carries over on the more expensive Echo Show 8, sadly.  No matter what you do you can't fully disable everything that rotates on the home screen.  This means that you can't disable all of that garbage and just have the home screen be a clock and the temperature 24/7/365.  Even if you disable every option as well as the ""Rotate Continuously"" at the bottom you will still have your precious clock &amp; temp minimize on a regular and constant basis while the stupid thing gives you ""pro tips"" of crap you can try saying.Amazon, how 'bout you give the users the option to FULLY and COMPLETELY disable this?!Enough people have complained about this and yet you persist on treating us like children.  Children with money to spend, mind you, but children nonetheless.  I don't need the hand holding that you seem to think we need.  I'm not huddled in a dark corner of my room shaking nervously frightened because I don't know how to ask Alexa to turn on a light.  You want to give new users a tutorial when they first set it up?  Fine.  This constant nagging that can't be disabled though is way, way, WAY too much.Enough people have hammered the reviews over exactly this on both devices and yet the solution has been ""coming soon"" for months.  This isn't a difficult change to implement if you really wanted to.I'm returning this Echo Show 8 due to these two reasons.  Awesome device (probably) if you can look past these issues I'm guessing.  I've already invested too much on three Echo Show 5's that I can't return so I'm not investing even more in an Echo Show 8 since it does the same BS only worse as those.If only Amazon was quicker to move on the simple requests of massive swaths of it's customers for one of their own products.  Maybe I'll go see what Google is offering in this same space now...."
"UPDATE: AMAZON helped me fix my problem with great service!My original review is below, but it turns out that I needed to change the wake word for the Echo Show. Amazon resolved this issue within an hour of my complaint. Now I am very happy with the Echo Show 8!ORIGINAL INCORRECT REVIEW: My new Echo Show 8 is 2 feet from me. My Echo Dot is in a room 15 feet away. About half the time, the Echo Show indicates that it is hearing my command, but the Dot in the other room responds to it. Makes it annoyingly useless to me. Also, it won't respond to commands to stop playing music, again probably a microphone issue. Will probably be returning it."
"Not as customizable as the Echo Show 5.While I was looking forward to a bigger screen to be seen further away, I was disappointed in a few things in comparison to the Echo Show 5.  It does have a bigger screen, however, the clock face is not as customizable as the 5.  Also, most of the time while on the home screen only shows the time, appearing to have no option to show the weather and date all the time such as the Show 5 does.  The sound is the same as the 5, the screen is bigger, but otherwise disappointed in the features of the Echo Show 8."
"Disappointed!!We were using Echo Dot and loved it. Kind of didn’t care where remotes or switches are anymore. Thus I was looking forward to get this latest Echo with screen. It’s newer thus hoped it to be better however it’s not. Its listening part is bad. We (my hubby and me) have to almost scream to make it listen. We have to talk towards this. In echo Dot, I could face away from it and ask things. But Echo 8 you have to speak to it and that too real loudly. Disappointed. I think the listening part of this echo 8 needs to be fixed or improved."
"A big improvement over the Show 5.All good so far.  I have the Show 5 and this is much better.  Better screen resolution, better speakers and obviously a larger screen.Like many others, I'm still not happy being unable to completely turn off the ""Try, Alexa..."" annoying banner at the bottom but it doesn't appear as often now as it does with the Show 5.  Mine is mostly just a large digital clock with a photo background, with the banner missing most of the time.I like it so much I'm getting a second one."
"WHY, Just Why? Try ""Echo, play harry potter quit"" - Try ""Echo, play some Motown"".PLEASE Add The Option to the Show to disable Things to Try.*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*First of, to the dude who's been telling everyone to ""Turn off Discovery"" That doesn't stop anything!That is Device Discovery not ""Things to Try""*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*I set the night mode to basically run all the time by setting the time to start &amp; stop to allow for almost continual sleep mode.Not a Real Solution, but a band-aid on this annoying &amp; completely unnecessary ""feature"" that is the equivalent of having a Backseat Driver telling you to turn left at every damn intersection when you know how to get where YOU WANT to go &amp; have been driving for years.*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*AMAZON, This is NOT a Feature! it should be a SETTING that we can turn off without having to disable our Picture Frame mode &amp; be stuck with a Dim Black Screen!I Wanted a Nice Alexa Enabled Smart Clock, Picture Frame, with Security Cam Display, and all these other awesome features.Well, at least I can still use the other features, but the Distractions caused by the ""Try This"" garbage really makes the other Display functions Un-Usable!*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*** Feature that would mitigate the headaches and lessen your returns ***PLEASE work on the Image rotation, slow dissolving / fading into the next image&amp; give OPTIONS to show the clock, show Things to Try, etc...an option to Dim the screen after X amount of minutes.an option to just go to Clock Mode after X amount of minutes."
"Problems with Arlo Cameras.Works nice, but is glitchy for the main reason I bought it. I purchased the Echo Show 8 so I could view live video on it in my office. Unfortunately it fails to work most of the time. It will connect sound but not the video feed.  I can view the video fine on my phone and iPad, but not on the Echo. If you’re looking to buy mainly for this purpose, I would wait until either Arlo or Amazon gets it figured out."
"My favorite amazon device.I’m using this as my bedroom clock and replaced an old echo dot. I like how it has the sunrise feature which is also mention in the echo show 5. The screen goes dark once you turn off the lights, so you don’t have to worry about ambient light staying on. Sound quality is really good compared to an old full size echo. I plan on buying another one for my kitchen now.. Kind of hooked to having a screen now..."
"Software isn't ready for prime time.The main complaint is the apps just don't work. Hulu TV gives an error message. I signed up for Food Network TV so that I could use one of the Show 8's in the kitchen, but it has no ability to do any of the live shows. It's sorta like Samsung and Apple TV's Food Network app, just some old recorded shows. Overall, it's just a larger screen that has Alexa and tells time, weather, etc. Touchscreen doesn't seem to work as well as the Show 5. I wonder if the largest Show has a glass screen. That might be why it's so expensive. The 1MP camera doesn't bother me as I don't use the video chat feature as I usually just use FaceTime. Sound is a bit better than the 5.UPDATE: I used the Amazon Trade-in Program where they give you X amount of money for an older Alexa device so long as your device isn't cracked. I traded in a Dot. The trade in amount was a mere $5. When they got it, they appraised it at $2 so I only got $2. I wasn't expecting that. My friend traded in his Echo. They told him it'd be $25. They sent it back to him without explanation and they kept his power supply. He spent 40 minutes on the phone being transferred to 3 people to finally get a resolution. Long story short. They do not explain why they refuse items or lower your value. Do NOT use the Trade-in program.Oh and the other issue with the Show 8 is it is very slow compared to the 5."
Great addition to my kitchen.Love it! Wish they had a full screen digital clock.
"Two problems with my new Echo Show 8.I have 2 main issues with the Echo Show 8:1. There doesn't appear to be any way to turn off the annoying feature that displays the constantly changing phrases that begin with ""Try, Alexa ...""2. I primarily bought this device to use with my Arlo cameras. Unfortunately, the Arlo skill is terrible. Most of the time, the cameras simply time out and will not display on the screen. This is more of an Arlo issue than an Echo Show issue; however, it directly impacts my ability to use the product."
"A must have home device!!I was so excited to receive my package in 3 days due to my prime membership.Once I unwrapped it, it was an easy setup.  All I had to do was plug it in and follow the on-screen instructions (i.e. logging into Wi-Fi)...I like that I have this item along with 3 echos drops which allows me to ""drop in""- a tool that can be used as an intercom for the house.  Unfortunately, im not always heard clearly.  I have taken full advantage of prime video and Hulu which plays clearly and the sound is entirely louder and crisper than I ever expected. I love the the built in Alexa.  Although, sometimes she responds to an unknown question.  Note: speak at a speed fast enough for Alexa to understand.  Any hestitation will cause Alexa to disregard your question.  Another note... You can call different devices by 5 different preselected names (Alexa, Echo, computer, and others).I really enjoy using this device in my bathroom as a tv and or video player.  When you play music from Prime Music the lyrics are displayed on the screen.There are many more skills that I have yet to review...l recommend watching some you tube videos or handbook to be sure you discover more of what the Echo 8 offers.  I know you can set reminders, conduct calls and more!!  I wish it allowed me to view Spectrum TVI can't wait to find more discoveries!Fyi... Download the Alexa app on your mobile phone.  My children can call me from the echo 8 while im at work. Lastly, Ring works well with this device.. You are notified by an alert whule being able to view any visitors at the front door or anywhere else you have a ring camera."
"No Music While Using Web Browser.I purchased this to use in the kitchen. If that is your intention, you need to know that the All Recipes Skill is utter garbage. There is absolutely no way for you to link your account so you won’t have access to your personal or saved recipes. Instead they will give you a few options to choose from. That’s useless to me. I finally figured out a way to access my personal recipes by using the web browser instead of using a skull. This would have been a minor inconvenience that I could live with except for one major issue. The Echo Show won’t play music and allow you to use the web browser at the same time. I always listen to music while cooking so this is an absolute deal breaker for me. It blows my mind that Amazon would design such a limited device as this when the top use of their devices is streaming music. This device doesn’t meet our needs in the least. I guess I will go back to using a tablet to look at my recipes while streaming music over a Dot. What a shame. I really thought Amazon was better than this. They really dropped the ball on what could have been a great device."
"No support from Amazon; Thing to try can not be turned off;.Can't turn off things to try.  Does not work out of the box with the Alexa app.  (Alexa App does not even have Alexa Show as an option of devices to add)You set it up first and then link it to the app.  So Network SID, Network password, location etc all have to be entered manually.I got the larger screen cause of vision issues but I Can't display time in a font large enough to see,I also can't see Day of Week, Date or seconds in the time.  Maybe there is a way to set that upAdding skills it does not let you just type in the skill.For example say I want to look at a recipe;  the ""rotate continuously"" means I get about 10 secounds to memorize the recipe  --OR-- go into settings; find the button; change the button; get the recipe ; then change it all back;and then there are the privacy issues ....and no support from Amazon."
"Updated: Slooooooooooow.Updated from 2 to 1 stars after using 2 weeks 12/13/19:Seems like it's getting slower.  We have to repeat commands several times to get it to work.  The device will recognize what we say but not actually follow through. Will be returning and going with a competitor.Original review:Traded the original Echo first gen to this model and so far have been very unimpressed. I will give it a few weeks to see if the software improves, but so far it takes 2-4x longer for simple commands to register compared to the original model.  Still prefer using Google Home as it beats the Amazon AI in almost every way, but I prefer the Amazon integration so I want to leave out hope.  On the plus side and screen quality and sounds quality are great.Pictured: Asking Alexa to ""play semisonic -secret smile on Spotify"" keeps playing some TV show I've never heard of."
"Beware if you return.The product wouldn't connect to my wifi, so I live-chatted with Amazon to see what was up.  It took approximately 75 minutes for the agent to tell me to do everything I told him I had already done.  In the end, it was decided that the product was defective and I should exchange it for a new one.The new one came to the wrong address (home, where nobody is during the day, vs. work, which I'd requested), and was Refurbished, in a plain black box instead of the one the Echo Show should come in, with even the Refurbished sticker sliced open, and missing the power cord.When I called to complain and request a THIRD item, I was told that I'm only allowed to exchange an item once.  They would instead reimburse me for the second item, and I could go back in and order another item if I wanted to.This is a gigantic pain in the ass."
"Show vs Nest - I now have both.Ok I’m not a highly knowledgeable person when it comes to tech, but I’m not a novice either. I actually bought the Show 8 and the Google Nest Hub at the same time because they were priced the same. I figured I would keep the better of the two. Nest arrived first so I set it up first. Setup was incredibly easy (I already have a nest mini), eventually easier than the Show. I also have a gmail account so that speeds up things on the Nest as well. I wasn’t keeping my photos on Google but it was pretty quick to add favorites in one folder and the Nest is now a digital photo frame. I have it on my nightstand because when you turn out the lights it really does go dark as well with a hint of the time showing - in full screen size. I am VERY sensitive to light at night and this doesn’t bother me at all. I also really like the “good morning” routine that you set up in the Nest better than the Show. It’s simple enough to ask and get info right before walking out the door.Once the Show arrived I did the setup thinking it would be easy as I have 3 dots and an Echo already. So yeah, setup went ok until you explore thinking ALL the reviews are wrong and you CAN turn off the “try this” feature. The answer is NO, you can’t. I have every part that should turn it off switched to off (even on the app). Constant “try this” on the screen. It’s ALWAYS there. And there is a list of what seems like a 100 “cards” so it never runs out. The software must’ve changed because all of the offered suggestions to turn it off aren’t accurate for what is currently possible. If you don’t care about that/wouldn’t bother you, then choose the unit that dominates your home or the website you use the most.So which is better? Meh, they’re about the same IMO. My sons and I usually have them compete with each other to see which one can answer a question accurately or with the best info. Lately there’s no clear winner on that, but Google is usually easier to understand. The Show does NOT go completely dark at night so I could never have it on my nightstand and the clock is never full screen so that’s annoying too. I have added a seasonal photo image on my amazon photo account using a computer so it’s decorative in the living room. I’m going to be installing a video doorbell myself soon and some interior cameras so I’ll update my review when those gadgets are added to compare use. Reviews I’ve read online say both units will work fine on both the doorbell and cameras so I’ll to do the installation to judge it."
"AMAZING!!!Hands down, this is by far the best item I have ever purchased for myself on Amazon.I was in desperate need of replacing my alarm clock on my nightstand, so I decided to go with the Echo 8 over the Echo 5. I purchased an Echo 5 as well, which will replace my Echo dot in my kitchen where I have less space, but this is about the Echo 8.I am absolutely amazed at the sound quality for starters. This Alexa packs exceptional sound quality into it's small design. I have a subscription to Sirius XM which I have synced to play through Alexa and I am extremely impressed with the balance of the bass and treble.The screen resolution is very nice for the photo displays. You can sync an assortment of photos through the Amazon Photo app or select a category for the Echo 8 to display for you. I have not tried to watch a video yet, but with the 8"" screen it would be very easy to enjoy and much more enjoyable than trying to view on your mobile device.  The Echo 8 is actually small enough to use on a nightstand and it has a night mode which will only show the clock on a dark screen. If you have a large room like I do, I would highly recommend the Echo 8. When I turned the volume up all the way it literally made me jump while I was sitting on my bed. This is one beefy little box, that is quite amazing. It's also very easy to sync all smart plugs, lights and devices to this groovy new Alexa. I cannot recommend this highly enough!"
"Take off “Ask Alexa”..This is my first day with it, it is going good. I just wish you can customize the clock screen also to the guy who said you can take the “ask alexa” thing off the bottom of the screen, you cannot. It is automatically on there and super annoying. I do like how I can view my cameras and control my smart devices from this though."
"""Try this"" -- Light bleeding -- customization.I am also not happy with the ""try this"" words at the bottom of the screen. It just doesn't fit the screen. Imagine if your phone constantly had that on it. It's just annoying. Also those who want to use this as an alarm clock-- the night time mode is too bright. Keeps your room relatively lit. The numbers and the fact it is not an AMOLED causes alot of light bleeding. Amazon please provide a AMOLED screen version. This will make a world of a difference. Lastly customization, there is little to none. You cant move the clock or select a different clock. You are stuck with the default. This thing has alot of potential, however the software isn't there to back it up."
"Not so great.I don't know what Amazon is trying to do with this device. You can't watch Hulu Live, YouTube TV or any other live TV. You can watch Prime Video, Hulu or NBC shows with commercials but not NBC live TV. For regular YouTube you have to use a browser.Why have a screen if you can't watch streaming services you subscribe to?If you want an Alexa device don't get the show models."
"Why I returned it.It was ok and I love the idea of a screen option to interact with my smart home devices, but the screen image was not so impressive. I also own a ""G"" nest hub and the screen image on it is awesome. My biggest complaint with the show 8 was the constant Alexa dialog at the bottom of the screen (""Try Alexa this, Try Alexa that). I like the idea of a video hub offering the option for a backlit photo frame that shuffles photos of my choice, but the never ending dialog at the bottom of the show 8 screen ruins that for me. That was my main reason for returning it. I wish it was optional to shut that off. I would have kept it."
"echo show 8.as a bedroom clock and music is very good,but i do agree with alot of reviews that state the home screen is really off the chain with the ads for alexa..""alexa tell me a joke"" or ""alexa sing happy birthday""...stuff like that or a list of commands should be sent with  the unit and user should be able to""disable"" that and only see the home screen.and im sure lots of people will agree that purchasing other things to control the tv,locks,ect from alexa should be built in and not an option to buy hubs,plugs ect. but my rating for the #8 show is good..but can use some updates and not just maintanance updates."
"NO NO NO ! Clock face is not available !My LCD clock in the family room is getting old and I was think about using this one as a nice replacement for it. I already have a couple of Echo Show 5"" in the kitchen and bedroom. What could go wrong with a bigger screen Echo Show ?! Well it turned out that I couldn't be more wrong that I'm now considering myself intelligently challenged compared to the super-smart Amazon people. Echo Show 5"" and 8"" are *totally* different !! With this big screen it does *NOT* allow you to choose the Clock Face. You only have a tiny clock showing on the 8"" screen. From the couch reading the time is like doing a vision exam at the eye doctor's office.So, I'm sorry, back you go. And good job, Amazon !"
"Great sound, gets better the more you play with it!Bought this instead of replacing my defunct electronic picture frame. Now I stream pictures from amazon photos and they look great on this screen. It's in the kitchen so great for using for the radio or internet but I'm finding the more I play with this, the more useful it is. I have Sonos speakers all over the house and can control them with a skill, which is great. But, the sound on this little baby i nearly there with the sound from the Sonos one, which i pretty impressive, loud and no distortion.Alexa has some pretty impressive capabilities and one of them is keeping my kids entertained. We already had an echo dot before this but now we are starting to communicate around the house with Alexa.Easy to install, easy to set up, easy to use. You get regular emails that inform you of new (and existing) ways to talk to her and get her to do things.Absolutely fantastic value as far as I'm concerned :-)"
"Something For Everyone.  Great Purchase!For those that don’t like “Try Alexa” on the bottom,  you can go to the Alexa app,  choose your “Show” in the device setting,  scroll down and turn on do not disturb.  Also, you can simply ask Alexa to turn on do not disturb. It changes the screen to a largerclock and removes the “Try Alexa”. I can still see my photos changing like a digital picture frame. I would imagine the next software update may give more options to toggle it off,  have more clock options, etc.As for the normal experience of having the Echo Show 8,  what a fun and useful tool that will take a long time to explore all of its uses. Sound and picture are very good.  I have some Foscam cameras,  Arlo and Nest cameras that are enabled and working.  This is not a security monitor, but gives you a convenient way to see what is going on.  I have an LG TV I can turn on and off, change volume and channels, some smart plugs to turn lights off an on.  Look,  for the $79 I paid for this it does more than anything else I own!  I also have been watching Amazon Prime movies on it and that has been fun.I think your chances of being very happy with this are very high.  I was so pleased that I bought 3 more ( with free Echo Dots ($75 at Best Buy) for my grown children!"
"Buy the Echo Show 5 Instead.IMHO, the Echo Show 5 (FIVE) is the best all-around Echo device you can buy. It is my bedside alarm clock, and so much more. Amazon hit it out of the park with the FIVE, and I couldn't be happier.But this review isn't about the FIVE. It's about the Echo Show 8 (EIGHT), and in this case, Amazon clearly struck out.The EIGHT should have been a larger version of the FIVE. Doing so would have made up for the one area where the FIVE is somewhat lacking--sound quality. But no, Amazon decided to go off in a different direction with the EIGHT, and in doing so, made a mess of what could have been an amazing device.Is the EIGHT a good clock? No. Most of the time, the clock is shoved into the upper left-hand corner of the screen, using about 10% of the available screen space. You absolutely cannot read the time unless you are less than two feet away from the device. When the device is in night mode, the clock is shoved into the lower left-hand corner of the screen, and is about twice as large, which means you can be about four feet from the device to read the time. As a clock, the EIGHT is a complete failure.Does the EIGHT play videos? Yes; however, I have a TV, a laptop, and an iPad. If I want to watch a video, I'm going to use one of those devices.Does the EIGHT play music? Yes, and the sound is almost as good the original Echo (almost), which I still have and still use. It displays track information while playing. In some cases, it also displays lyrics. If that's important to you, it's a plus. You can also connect this to external speakers through a patch cord or Bluetooth, but if you do that, the value of the EIGHT is diminished.Is the EIGHT a digital frame? Well, it could be. It tries to be. The picture is beautiful, to be sure. It's nice to see rolling images, either stock or your own, in beautiful high-resolution color. Unfortunately, the view is interrupted by the clock in the upper right-hand corner (not a big deal) and the ever-present ""try this"" at the bottom. BTW, are digital frames even a thing anymore?I read the reviews before purchasing this, so I knew what I was getting into. But it was stupid cheap, and I couldn't pass it up at the holiday deal price, so what the heck.All things considered, the EIGHT could be great...it just isn't. Amazon blew it. It is my least favorite device and, quite frankly, not worth the price, even on sale.I'm not going to return it for two reasons. First, I knew what I was getting when I bought it, so I can't say I'm disappointed. My expectations were already low. Second, Amazon has a way if improving their devices, and the EIGHT is still relatively new in the line-up. I have expectations that Amazon will hear consumer feedback and make changes to the EIGHT that make it more like the FIVE, which is what it should have been in the first place.If you haven't purchased an EIGHT yet, don't. Get the FIVE instead. You will be far happier, especially if you want the device as a clock."
"This Simplifies My Life.I received my Echo Show 8 today and it's already set up and I'm very happy with it. I bought a second one, as well, to give to my mother for Christmas. I intend to buy security cameras very soon to work with Alexa, and I just purchased smart bulbs to use in my home. I also have a 43"" TCL Roku Smart TV, which I can control, to some degree, with Alexa. I'm still figuring it out, but I've been able to switch from antenna TV, and open my Hulu app on the TV through Alexa. I haven't tried asking for a specific show or channel to play, but Alexa should be able to do those commands. The Echo is in my kitchen and the TV is in my bedroom, and they communicate just fine.I was in the cleaning mood tonight, and have been listening to some great Motown through the Echo Show 8 from my Amazon Music account. I'm impressed with the speakers and clarity. They're not top of the line, but they sound great, not at all tinny.I also noticed that when I turned the lights down, the Echo automatically went into a standby mode, blank with just the time showing. The music continued to play, however. When I turned the lights back on, it woke up again, displaying song lyrics, etc. Oh, and even with the music up at its loudest, I am able to give Alexa a command without having to yell, even from across the room.The Echo does continually show suggestions at the bottom of the screen, which some people have complained about. I pretty much ignore it because I'm not usually staring at the screen for it to bother me. While it's just sitting there, it will also go through news headlines. There may be a way to change these features, but I haven't yet explored that possibility.I did, also, ask Alexa to open Hulu and started watching a show directly on the Echo, just to test it out. It worked well, and the picture looked good. I just had to sign into Hulu on the Amazon Alexa app.There's still much to learn, but overall, I can see the Echo Show 8 being a helpful and fun part of my everyday routine. I asked Alexa to set a reminder alarm, which she did, and that's going to be a huge help for me. Once I get security cameras and the lights put up, I'll be set. I resisted getting any kind of ""Smart"" device for a while, but I'm glad I finally got the Echo. I'm always looking things up on my phone, or setting alarms to remind me to do things, so this just makes staying informed and organized so much easier. I will probably get another Echo Show 8 for my room after I get the security cameras so I can check them without having to go into the kitchen.I scooped up my Echo Show 8 and my mother's during the Black Friday sale on Amazon, so I couldn't resist the price. I also got Echo Dots for my four grown daughters, and will see how they like them.UPDATE: I thought this was great. I asked Alexa for the number to Fed Ex, which she found. Then she asked if I'd like her to call them for me. I talked to Fed Ex through Alexa and the call was clear. After the call, I said, ""Alexa, hang up."" And that was it! I didn't have to pick up my phone or search for the number. I love my Echo!"
"THIS PRODUCT IS NOT READY FOR PRIME TIME!EVERYTHING IS CONTROLLED BY YOUR MOBIL ALEXA APP.  IT NEEDS A MAJOR UPGRADE, YET REMAINS THE SAME.  THE MAJOR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT I ASSUMED THE LATEST GENERATION OF ECHO SHOW WOULD PROVIDE WAS AT LEAST THE SAME FUNCTIONALITY AS MY MUCH OLDER ECHO  2ND GEN ECHO TOWER.  IT IS TWO YEAR OLD NOW BUT PICKS UP YOUR VOICE TEN TIMES BETTER THAN ANY ECHO SHOW, WHICH EXPLAINS EVEN THEIR PRIMARY ECHO' SHOW'S LOW RATINGS.WHAT IS MOST ANNOYING IS MY COMMANDS TO TURN ON A PARTICULAR DEVICE WILL APPEAR TO BE ACCEPTED AND COMPLETED AS THE ECHO SHOW SHUTS OFF, BUT THE LIGHT I TOLD HER TO TURN ON IS STILL UNLIT.  I HAVE TO AGAIN ASK HER TO DO THE SAME THING AND THEN IT COMES ON.  I HAVE MANY ECHO LIGHTS, PLUGS, AND OTHER DEVICES.  MY ATTEMPTS TO TRIGGER MULTIPLE FUNCTIONS TO OCCUR BY GIVING ALEXA A COMMAND RARELY WORKS.  I HAVE ALSO NOTICES THAT THE DEVICES WITH AMAZON PLUGS THAT WERE TURNED OFF HOURS EARLIER WILL SUDDENLY BE FOUND ON, WITHOUT EXPLANATION.  HAVING TO REPEAT THE SAME COMMAND TWO TIMES BEFORE IT TURNS ON OR OFF IS REALLY ANNOYING!  I WENT INTO THE ALEXA APP AND DELETED ANY PRIOR USE OF SKILLS AND CAN NO LONGER FIND ANY THAT HAVE NOT BEEN DELETED.  YET I STILL WILL COME HOME TO FIND DEVICES (MOSTLY LIGHTS) THAT ARE SUDDENLY ON AS IF SHE IS ACTIVATING THEM AT A PREDETERMINED TIME.  YOU WILL FIND THAT ANY DEVICE THAT IS NOT MADE BY AMAZON, BUT IS COMPATIBLE WITH ALEXA, MUST BE USED TO ACTIVATE THAT PLUG OR LIGHT.  I HAVE SMART-THINGS, KASA, ETC.  THEY MUST BE USED TO CONNECT THEIR DEVICE TO YOUR HOME NETWORK. ONCE THEY ARE WORKING PROPERLY, ALEXA CAN BE USED TO ADD THEM BUT WHAT IS NEEDED IS ONE CENTRAL ICON THAT CONTROLS EVERYTHING.  I'VE HAD SO MANY PROBLEMS TRYING TO USE THE VOICE COMMAND WITH ALEXA WITHOUT HAVING TO REPEAT IT 2-3 TIMES BEFORE A LIGHT GOES OFF THAT I'M READY TO SEND THE THING BACK.  THE LEARNING CURVE FOR ALEXA IS MUCH GREATER THAN IT NEEDS TO BE.  THE TERMS THAT AMAZON USES TO DESCRIVE CERTAIN FUNCTIONS ARE JUST NOT COMMON AND I WOULD NEVER REMEMBER TO SAY THEM IN ORDER FOR ALEXA TO TURN LIGHTS ON AND BEGIN PROVIDING THE DAILY WEATHER, NEWS ETC.  RATHER AN REQUESTING SHE PROVIDE YOUR MORNING NEWS AS SELECTED WHEN IT WAS SET UP, I HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT ITS NOT THE NEWS, ITS MY ""FLASH BRIEFING"".  WHEN I FIRST WAKE UP, I CAN'T REMEMBER TO USE A PHRASE THAT I'VE NEVER USED IN MY LIFE AND JUST ISN'T SOMETHING THAT SEEMS NECESSARY.  IF THEIR AI WAS A ONE FIRMWARE UPGRADE UP, ALEXA SHOULD ALLOW ME TO NAME MY ""SKILL"" WHICH IS ANOTHER WORD THAT JUST DOESN'T FIT THE PROCESS BEING PROGRAMMED.  FINALLY, ALEXA IS FAR FROM BEING READY FOR PRIME TIME BUT SIRI OR HEY GOOGLE ARE NO BETTER.  WHAT BOTHERS ME IS THE ECHO MODEL (SPECIFICALLY THE ECHO SHOW) HAS ITS VISUAL BENEFITS, HOWEVER, TO GAIN THOSE BENEFITS I FEEL I HAVE LOST THE BASIC FUNCTIONALITY OF MY FORMER ECHO TOWER.  WHEREVER THEY PLACED THE MICROPHONE ON THE ECHO SHOW, UNLIKE THE ROUND ECHO TOWER THAT PICKS UP YOUR VOICE FROM ANY DIRECTION, THE ECHO SHOW CAN ONLY HEAR FROM THE FRONT OF THE UNIT.  IF THE TELEVISION IS ON, SHE WILL RARELY GET THAT I SAID CORRECTLY ALTHOUGH I AM SPEAKLING LOUDLY AND CLEARLY.  I CAN'T PROVIDE A REMINDER UNLESS I GO THROUGH FOUR STEPS. FORST TO NOTIFY ALEXA THAT I HAVE A NEW REMINDER, SHE WILL ASK WHAT IT IS BUT I CANNOT PROVIDE HER WHAT THE REMINDER IS  WHILE ALSO TELLING HER THE DATE AND TIME.  SHE WILL IGNORE IT EVERYTHING BUT WHAT THE REMINDER IS AND THEN ASK ME WHEN WHAT DATE AND TIME OF THE REMINDER.  I A POSITIVE I NEVER HAD TO DO THAT IN THE PAST.  SHE responds FROM HER ONLY RECORDING WHATEVER THE REMINDER IS BUT I MUST WAIT FOR HER TO ASK FOR THE DATE AND TIME.  I DON'T REMEMBER HAVING TO DO THAT WITH MY ALEXA ECHO TOWER???  IT TAKES SO MANY STEPS, I STOPPED USING IT.  APPARENTLY THE ALEXA APP ON MY PHONE IS THE PRIMARY BRAINS BUT EVERY ALEXA DEVICE IS NOT CREATED EQUALLY AND THE SOFTWARE THAT DRIVES IT IS UNIQUE TO THE DEVICE.  I HAVE EVEN BEGUN TO USE ANY OF THE FEATURES THE ECHO SHOW IS KNOWN FOR.  I AM CURIOUS AS TO WHY THE ECHO SHOW WANTS TO DEFAULT TO CONNECTING VIA BLUETOOTH WHEN WI-FI HAS SUCH GREATER DISTANCE.  IF I ASK ALEXA A QUESTION SUCH AS, ""DO YOU KNOW WHEN THE HEISMAN TROPHY PRESENTATION WILL BE BROADCAST ON TV""?  THAT REQUEST CAUSES HER TO GO INTO CONVULSIONS.  SHE DOESN'T HAVE A CLUE WHAT THE QUESTION WAS AND BEGINS GIVING ME A HISTORY LESSON OF WHEN THE HEISMAN TROPHY WAS FIRST INTRODUCED.  TRYING TO INTERRUPT HER TO SHUT HER UP IS NEAR IMPOSSIBLE.  SHE IS DEFINITELY FEMALE. LOL  NOW THAT SEVERAL CREDIBLE NEWS SOURCES HAVE REPORTED THAT AMAZON'S RINGER PRODUCT WHICH I HAVEN'T INSTALLED YET, BUT I'M ASSUMING THE VIDEO IT RECORDS IS UPLOADED TO THE AMAZON CLOUD.  HOWEVER, THOSE RECORDING SHOULD BE ENCRYPTED AND PRIVATE. THEY SHOULD NOT BE RELEASED TO ANYONE WITHOUT THE EXPRESS CONSENT OF THE OWNER. ABC NEWS REPORTED THAT POLICE WERE SELLING SOMETHING AND GIVING AWAY ALEXA RINGERS BECAUSE IT WILL PROVIDE THEM CAMERAS ALL OVER THE CITY. i'm NOT OPPOSED TO THIS AS AN INVESTIGATOR, BUT I DO NOT WANT IT PROVIDED AUTOMATICALLY TO ANYONE AND IF AMAZON DOES SO, THEY WILL RUE THE DAY, PERHAPS BY BEING OFFLINE FOR A FEW WEEKS!IF YOUR FORTY PAGE TERMS GIVE EMPLICIT PERMISSION TO DISTRIBUTE THE VIDEO. THEN I WILL HAVE NO ALTERNATIVE THAN TO RE-ENGINEER IT TO NO LONGER UPLOAD ANYTHING TO AN INSECURE CLOUD SERVICE.THAT WOULD BE A BLATANT INVASION OF PRIVACY AND RESULT IN WORSE PUBLIC EXPOSURE THAN AMAZON SEEMS TO RECEIVE EVERY DAY FROM VIOLATING THE RIGHTS OF THEIR CUSTOMERS TO ENRICH THEMSELVES OR SHARE WITH A CORRUPT FEDERAL ORGANIZATION.MY GUESS IS AMAZON WAS THREATENED BY THE NSA WITH THEIR ILLEGAL SURVEILLANCE OF YOUR CEO AND HAS NOW BECOME ANOTHER TECH WHORE EVENTUALLY BECOMING A COMPLETE WHORE LIKE GOOGLE AND THEIR PIMP THE NSA, CIA, AND OTHER AGENCIES THAT OPERATE OUTSIDE THE AUTHORITY OR OVERSIGHT OF ANYONE.  THE CIA ARE THE SAME PEOPLE WHO ARE SMUGGLING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN DRUGS FROM MEXICO USING TUNNELS THAT DOPEY HASN'T EVER THOUGHT OF. THE CIA HAS BEEN IN THE DRUG TRADE SINCE VIETNAM IN ORDER TO FUND THEIR BLACK OPS MISSIONS.  THOSE ACTIVITIES THEY DON'T WANT CONGRESS TO BE ABLE TO TRACE BY FOLLOWING THE MONEY.  THIS IS WHY THE ADMINISTRATION ONLY WANTS TO ERECT A WALL TO PREVENT MOSTLY CHILDREN AND WOMEN FROM INVADING OUR COUNTRY WHILE HIS 50 IQ GENIUS MIND IS CLUELESS AS TO THE HUNDREDS OF ELABORATE TUNNELS THAT EXIST BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES AND WHERE WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY TO REVEAL THEM AND SHUT THEM DOWN.  THIS IS PRIMARILY THE CIA BUT IS COMMON KNOWLEDGE TO MOST ANYONE WHO BOTHERS TO INVESTIGATE IT, EXCEPT FOR THE 98% OF AMERICA THAT IS SPOON FED EVERY DAY BY FOX CHILDRENS NETWORK.WHILE VERY LITTLE HAS EVER PROCEEDED OUT THE MOUTH OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE ASYLUM THAT EVEN RESEMBLES THE TRUTH, YET IT BECOMES WHAT THE MAJORITY BELIEVE. ""IT'S IGNORANCE GONE TO SEA!!""AFTER AMAZON WAS PASSED OVER FOR A 25 BILLION DOLLAR CONTRACT, I'm SURE THEY WERE ADVISED WHAT THEY NEEDED TO DO TO BE CONSIDERED THE NEXT TIME.  MONEY IS THE DRIVING FORCE.  AFTER THER WAS ZERO EXCUSE FOR ALEXA TO BE RECORDING WHEN NOT ACTIVATED AND AMAZON EMPLOYEES LISTENING TO RANDOM CONVERSATIONS WILL RESULT IN YET THE THIRD MAJOR CLASS ACTION PENDING LAWSUIT THAT I JUST REVIEWED FROM GACOVINO, LAKE, AND ASSOCIATES ""TOPCLASSACTIONS.COM""DUE TO THE NUMBER OF BUGS IN THE AMAZON ECHO SHOW 8, I WILL HAVE TO RETURN IT LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE THAT TOUCHES ON TECHNOLOGY GREATER THAN A FIFTH GRADE LEVEL.DON'T BUY THIS ERROR RIDDLED DEVICE!"
"Have had it a while now.And I'm really pleased with this. I had debated between this size and the larger one, but ultimately decided this would fit well in the space I had. I have this in my kitchen, I use it for viewing my recipes, playing music, etc. This is not my only alexa device in the house, I have a dot (in my daughters room and on her account), an echo show 5 (in my office), and the Fire cube.We had to turn off the voice activation on the cube (we have an open concept, so they were fighting) which my husband hates anyway, so he didn't mind that. My daughter had briefly moved her dot in her room and we discovered me using the show in the kitchen (near her room) was setting off her dot too, so she moved hers back and away from her door.I've been playing music (spotify) in my office and walked into the kitchen to see if it would play on both devices, or what would happen. It picked up where the office one left off, the office one stopped, but when I went back into the office (much later), what was playing in the kitchen did not start in the office. It's not a big enough deal to me to go see how to fix it, but in case anyone was wanting that functionality, you may want to look that up.I'm pleased with the size, I was hoping I wouldn't regret not getting the larger one, but I don't. It fits perfectly, I can see the screen just fine, and I've had no issues. My husband was worried I'd get the bigger one for my office, but I prefer the smaller one there too."
"Bigger but not at lot  better...than the the Echo 5. Worse in some cases.If your main reason for buying the Echo 8 is a bigger screen, go for it.  It does that about as well as you would expect.  Everything else, except perhaps sound quality, puts it behind the Echo 5 in terms of quality and extras.The screen, while larger, seems a bit washed out to me, compared to the 5. You have far fewer customization options in terms of clock faces and backgrounds.  You would expect better sound quality given the larger cabinet and (presumably) larger speaker. But it's really not that much better. Marginally perhaps.Also, since it has a bigger screen and the same wedge form factor as the 5, the entire device is much much larger, which might not make it suitable in places where space is at a premiumI wanted it mainly for the kitchen, for calling up recipes, which are easier to see, with less scrolling, than on the smaller Echo 5 screen. Mission accomplished there, although it is so large, it barely fits where I wanted to put. And was a bit disappointed at all the other downgrades.One upside it it seems to handle wakeup better than the 5. Not sure why but the 5 always seemed a bit hard of hearing.  Perhaps because I have so many other Alexa devices scattered about the house and they were all fighting for control. The whole ESP thing that is supposed to make the closest one respond didnt work very well with the 5. This one is very responsive unless there is a lot of ambient noise."
"I am blown away at the quality!Ok, so like, a decade ago I was an early adopter of the Sony Dash, it was a small tabletop alarm clock that could show you facebook posts, play music, play Netflix, and a bunch of other stuff. The thing about the Sony Dash was that it completely sucked! The interface was clunky, the home screen was not customizable and the video playback was always choppy. After a few years Sony stopped supporting the device all together and it became a paper weight. This was probably somewhere in 2008-2009. Well, ten years later I just picked up the Amazon Echo 8 and I blown away at how awesome it is! The sound quality is GREAT! The screen is beautiful! The ease of use is amazing. Within minutes I had it connected to Prime Video, XM satellite radio, and all the other stuff. I highly recommend this as an addition to any room. I am blown away!"
"Great upgrade.Well I started out having troubles with connecting my cameras, then I took a deep breath and reinstalled all the devices. Works like a charm, I have Ring doorbell and couple Wyze cameras and I can view them, yay! sound is good for the device, actually better then I expected(if I need better sound I was able to connect to speaker in the living room and bedroom, so I do have a choice of sound). There still issues with some skills for the show, but skills important to me work great.I am happy with my Alexa upgrade."
"Beautiful video, sound is very good, but not that intuitive.The screen quality is excellent, the sound quality is very good, and the features are many.  In fact, that is a problem starting out.  There is no manual and online help is limited.  I suppose I could spring another $10 for a book, but why?  I'm already not happy that there is no pre-booking guarantee.  I pre-ordered for $99, and the day it arrived the price was $79, but I cannot get the lower price.There are many features but getting the most out of them is not always easy.  For example, the alarm has a repeat function for daily, weekly, weekends, or week days.  I work a rotating schedule so the days I need an alarm rotate every two weeks.  After a couple of weeks, I discovered if I touch the date once I set an alarm, I can get a calendar.  This way I can program just the days I want the alarm.  Too bad there isn't a manual to look this up.I'm sure the Echo Show will be more useful once I add more Alexa hardware and apps.  As it is, I'm turning on lights, setting the thermostat, utilizing time, temp, and alarm, listening to music, and watching video.  Other thing is, my wife hates to talk to Alexa.  Not sure what do about adding that app."
Great device.I have it in my kitchen.  Love playing music.  Used it for recipes today.
Worked great for 2 hours.Worked literally for 2 hours then the screen went black and doesn’t turn on.  Return process was kind of painful but hopefully the new one actually works.  I kinda liked it for 2 hours.  Will post another review once I get the new one.
"Great device with major caveats.I’m very tech savvy and found setup cumbersome and time consuming. If all you want are the defaults, it’s a breeze, but if you want anything other than want Amazon wants, pour yourself a drink!If you are buying one to setup for an elderly relative, create a separate email account AND have that person’s cell phone when you setup initially. I made the mistake of setting up initially with my phone and email thinking I could easily edit it later. That was a huge mistake! It required a couple of lengthy phone calls to Amazon to get my cell phone number disassociated and their number associated.Also, on one of those calls, I had the person tell me that my Amazon account and my Alexa account are linked. They are not!If you don’t want to give access to all your phone’s contact, you can set up contacts separately but it’s not at all intuitive. It took me a while to figure it out. Let’s face it, if you’re setting this us up for grandma, she only needs a handful of people that she will be calling, not your hundreds of business and personal contacts."
"Disappointment compared to the Echo Show 5.My Echo Show 8 arrived today.  I was expecting it to be a larger version of the Echo Show 5.  Not so.  You can see the time on the Echo Show 5 from 20 feet away.  This model doesn’t have a large centered clock and  it doesn’t give you the date anywhere.  I suppose I could shout at Alexa from across  the room to ask for the time and date for but it is not worth the breathe when you could otherwise just glance at it.  This is like a large size down grade.  I may return it unless I get a response from someone at Amazon telling me there is going to be a quick fix for this soon.After giving this a negative review, I received a call from Amazon Customer Service.  While I may not be in love with my Echo Show 8, I really love Amazon and their customer service.  The Echo 8 is growing on me.  I will not be returning it. However I still prefer the image of a large centered clock with a date stamp like the Echo 5 much better."
Best Echo Show yet (8).Love this Alexa show 8. For all those people listening to the whiners go on about the writing across the bottom that says try Alexa this or that. How many of you sit and stare at the hone screen. It doesn’t show watching the news or video or Amazon music. I nearly did not buy it because of the negative crap. What a loss that would have been. Screen is phenomenal and the sound is awesome and love the fact if u look up something new is constantly rotating through the screen. Wow a lot of cry babies on here. Shame on you. It’s an amazing product
limited documentation and inconsistent voice activation lead to frustration with this product.The Alexa voice activation was inconsistent and required the end user to set up and document what verbal constructs actually work to achieve the goal. The program should act to recognize when the user is trying to  achieve some outcome and when it is finally reached identify the verbal sequence and relate it to the many attempts used before success and recognize these when they occur again. Now  a long process of learning what phrases in what gramatical order and  using which descriptors is required in all but the simplest of requests. Documentation is limited and aside from purchasing books written by authors who have puzzeled out the supposed manual of operation there is sparse and incomplete online content provided. All in all very frustrating and very limiting in usages of this product and ecosystem provided by online interfaces....
"Almost perfect.So I’ll get the two flaws out of the way first. First is the same thing most people don’t like... the non stop “Ask Alexa...” prompts written across the bottom of the screen. There’s no way to turn them off. And they’re annoying and kinda tacky. Like we already drank the Alexa Kool Aid, stop trying to sell us. But anyway besides that it’s great. I’m apple products through and through. Then I got an echo dot with my fire stick purchase and we loved it. I have a ring doorbell, so I wanted it to work with that, and auto show me the doorbell instead of having to look at our phones. And it works great, kind of. You still have to say “Alexa show me the front door”. Kind of frustrating that it’s already communicating with the doorbell. It rings and tells you someone’s at the door. Why can’t it auto show the camera feed when someone rings? Hopefully a future update. But all other aspects of it are great. Screen looks great. It sounds great. It’s the perfect side to be by my front door table. Super easy to set up. Just fix those 2 things!!"
"Echo Show 8 Does Not Work With Arlo!I bought two Echo Show 8s and neither of them work with the Arlo skill. The two Echo Show 8s I bought from Amazon do not display live video feed from my front door camera. Instead, it only displays a screen shot of the last time it connected properly and says “Waiting for Arlo” for hours. I spoke with Amazon technical support for two hours and followed all their troubleshooting tips from resetting devices to upgrading software which included climbing up and down a ladder twice to resync my Arlo front door camera. The only compensation an Amazon supervisor could offer me for their false advertising, poor customer service, and inconvenience to me is a return and refund. I deeply regret purchasing two of these items. I won’t be recommending Amazon products to family and friends."
"easy setup.easy to use, Amazon is awesome"
Things to try is annoying af.Things to try is annoying af AMAZON PLEASE MAKE AN OPTION TO TURN THIS OFF that ACTUALLY work I have over 15 Alexa products in my house so im not new to how to operate it...i have it turned off in the settings but it K E E P S coming back and the picture settings dont work either if I select the option to make the pictures change every 2 seconds or 6 seconds it still do wtf it wants the pictures stay on the screen for about 2 minutes before changing and of course “TRY ALEXA” is on my pics as well SMH
"LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!!This was my Christmas present to myself. I'm a HUGE Alexa girl. I love that while I'm cooking that it can help me with a recipe (THIS DEVICE IS A MUST HAVE IN THE KITCHEN). I also love that I can watch a movie while in the kitchen now. I wanted a small TV in the kitchen but all of them that I found I found were just too big. This fits right on top of my microwave. The sound and video quality are amazing! I'm 100% happy with mine. As far as the ""Alexa, try..."" issue that people are having I actually love! It gives me some great suggestions that I would of never thought of. It's not intrusive and it's barely even noticeable unless you are looking for it. The device comes with a ton of options too. This is my first Echo Show but I'm 100% happy with it. NEXT COMES THE RING!!!! :D"
"LOVE IT!!I'm so happy I purchased this.. takes some getting used to. but once you learn how you will LOVE IT!! don't forget to download and install the latest version of the Amazon Alexa app from the app store on your phone or whatever device you use.  the Amazon Alexa app helps you see an overview of your echo show 8. Its where you see an overview of your request and manage your contacts, list, news, music, games, and settings. the sound quality is amazing while listening to music etc...  I have not had a chance to try out the camera or video calling as of yet due to not knowing anyone with an echo 8 :-(  make sure you purchase the stand this keeps it from directly sitting flat on surfaces and protects from accidental spills little pricey tho but worth it. I love this device so much I bought a 2nd one :-)"
"Very Good Device, but still has Flaws..First off, Kudos to amazon for doing right by me when my discontinued Echo spot started acting up.  They gave me the full purchase price as a credit toward the Show 8.  Ended up only costing me $5 with the $99 sale price.So now to the review.  It should be noted that I have a Show 5 as well, so I will make a couple of references when going over features and function.  To start, as HUGE plus is the ability to physically disable the camera.  This is something that the show 5 had but the Echo Spot didn't.  Its nice having the peace of mind not having to worry about anyone's privacy, no matter what room the device is in.The Screen is HUGE, bright and clear.  Its nice not having to watch distorted videos on a round screen.  Its a great price point between the show 5 and the original Echo Show.  The camera is the same as the Show 5 @ 1mp, more then enough for video chat.  It looks clear, with now distortions. This of course will depend on your internet/WiFi connectivity. The sound quality is very good.  Its not a $2k audio system, but its not a cheep pair of headphones ether...  The sound is rich and full and quite enjoyable.  Functionally its like any other Alexa device.Now for the issues.  The two big ones, and the reason for knocking off the 2 stars, is first, the LIMITED availability of clock face customization.  If you go to settings and select clock &amp; faces, all you can pick is the clock background.  The HUGE face, and the time is limited to being displayed in one corner.  The Show 5 had all kinds of face options, but this one only lets you pick the backgrounds.  Yes you can have a photo or something from Facebook, a couple of ugly pictures and a single semi solid background, but that's it.  You should at the very least be able to have the time take up most of the screen to be able to see it at night or from across the room.  The show 5 has customization, why is it not part of the Show 8 as wellThe other one is an annoyance with every screen based Alexa device I have ever owned.  YOU CAN NOT DISABLE THE ""THINGS TO TRY"" TEXT.  Its in the middle of, or on the bottom of almost EVERY card that the device displays.  You can turn off everything else, but not that....  I want to have it rotate between time &amp; weather...  THAT'S ALL.  If I need to find new things to try I will look it up myself....  This has annoyed me and A LOT of other people for a very long time.  Come on Amazon, lets have a way to turn this off.Overall I am happy, and hopeful that Amazon will listen and get us some updates real soon...  I'll update this if anything else happens."
"Music and Photos With Built in Video - What's Not to Love.After 16 years of marriage my husband I have arrived at a stage in our life where gift giving is no longer relegated to birthdays and holidays because we have the disposable income of an established couple with no children. In short, if we want something, we buy it. Christmas gift giving was once an ungodly stressful event  until we decided to stop with the gifts. This year however, I saw the Echo Show and decided to take a chance and surprise my favorite spouse with a present for his work office. He loves having family photos on display, but his iPad is old and does not always connect to the very secure office network and he enjoys playing music, but he needs to have his phone available for calls and his work computer is a PC and cannot hold personal files. The Show is really the perfect solution.When he opened the box his first reaction was suspicion because our house is currently overflowing with Alexas. We have so many Alexas in fact that there is an unopened Dot on our dining room table, we sent two brand new Dots to my brother and we have an older Dot that will be needing a new home after its replacement arrives next week. Once I started to explain the features of the Show a bit of excitement started to build. I knew I had him hooked when he plugged it in immediately and asked Alexa to play music and the lyrics popped up on the screen so he could sing along. ""This is pretty cool.""Then he started tweaking the settings and the home screen and added a background photo. It was all very easy. I use Amazon Photo storage as a backup tool for all of my family photographs. There are currently around 20,000 photos that are thankfully loosely organized into albums. I spent a good 4 hours creating a new 250 photo Echo Show album and then because my husband is a family vault member and can see all of my photos he can add photos to the album. The slideshow feature is really his favorite part of the whole Show. He loves the music, he loves Alexa, but he really loves having photos on his desk.The Echo Show's first week in his office was a success and when his boss stopped by his office, she loved the Show so much she ordered her own. My husband is able to listen and sing along to his music and see his family. We ordered a Show for our kitchen and my parents ordered one for their kitchen so we can easily make video calls between all of us during the day. Now if anyone can tell me what to do with all of these Dots, I would really appreciate it."
Great product.Great sound &amp; size. Just starting to play around with it. Like it so far!
"Pretty Cool, it's the same old Alexa with a screen.I wasn't really expecting to be blown away by this item, and I'm really not. It does give you that futuristic feeling like your in the movie Aliens and Sigourney Weaver is calling you, getting you out of a sound sleep to make sure you're not bringing them back to study!! ha. First thing that came to mind when I used the Camera. Which is a nice feature, though 1MP, that's a little strange. Though it's pretty clear. But a little ""invasive"" with the drop in feature, which can be adjusted. The screen is VERY touch sensitive, which is good if you use it, and that's actually, rarely. Since the voice recognition is excellent.I find myself mostly using my voice most, since that's really what it's designed for. Alexa is integrated MUCH better and she it super responsive, compared to the old models. Almost overly so. The screen isn't really that bright which is good, and it's not a strain on the eyes. However I don't picture myself watching much on Amazon Prime Video on this device. For that it's really for the ""Kitchen"" area for people who spend time in their cooking, eating, or sitting working on something at the table. Then i can picture it being like a small TV in the background like from the 80's, when people use to keep up on their Soap Operas.My biggest disappointment overall it the sound, louder isn't always ""better"". The lack of high end just really doesn't cut it for me when I'm listening to music on it. It seems to have good panning, but the bass (on this model) is just to overwhelming in my opinion. Even when Alexa speaks it's very very low end, even boomy. But for the price, it's a very cool gadget. The wireless works perfect, and the range is incredible. Probably the best I've seen on anything, no interruptions, pausing, stuttering, or anything like that. So if you're in the market for a ""New Alexa"" this one is the right price, and I definitely recommend it over the others. Even next to your bed you may want to watch a short episode of your favorite sitcom or something. But whole movies? Not so much. So I like it, and it's very innovative. I see why they don't stay on the shelves in stores. A solid 3.5......btw AMAZON this is YOUR product, can you let us reviewers have ""half"" a star for pity sake? ha....ENJOY!!!"
Que no dejen de comprarla no se van a arrepentir es maravillosa.Solo puedo decirle q me encanto es maravillosa sobre paso mis expectativas estoy felizzzzzz😜😊😍
"Pretty good... but hopefully it will improve with time.I bought the Echo Show 8 as a Christmas gift for my wife, who wanted to use it in the kitchen. She was a bit heartbroken over the the ""things to try"" scrolling non-stop across the screen, we were going to return the unit. However, Amazon must have gotten many complaints because they got rid of it. Once that was fixed we set about figuring out how to use it. More on that in the Good/Could be better below.Mounting:Our kitchen is tiny, so the only option was to mount it below a cabinet. Note that there is no provision to mount it this way. I had to make a mount that curled down and around the back to the bottom. There is a metal plate on the bottom of the Echo Show 8 and it can be secured with a large magnet.. which is what I did. Because we are tight on counter space, I made the mount on a rail that allows the whole unit to be slid back under the cabinet to get it out of the way (you can see this in the pictures I included.)  If we had a bit more room we would have just set it on the counter or picked up one of the many mounts available.The good:The screen is bright, clear and adapts nicely to changes in ambient light. The clock is useful. You can load your own pics so it rotates through them, making a nice picture frame (my wife loves this.) When you ask for the weather it gives a nice display of the hourly temps/forecast, or a weeks overview, depending on what you ask for (see pic.) The speaker is adequate. Alexa does all the things available on Dot or other device: runs routines, turns lights on and off, has the Guard feature, etc.  The Echo Show 8 is useful for viewing security cameras, we have some Wyze cameras and we can just ask ""Alexa, show me the entrance"" and in a few seconds, its on the screen (see pic.) When you play music, the Echo 8 displays the lyrics. If you set a countdown timer while cooking, it remains on the screen. If you set two timers, it shows the one that is going to go off first, then shows the second: my wife loves this for cooking (she used to have to keep asking Alexa ""how much time is left on the timer?"" as she tried to coordinate multiple items being readied. You can watch movies on the Echo Show 8 as well, probably not the best screen for viewing, but it does work.To be frank, the Echo 8 earns its keep just on the above features.The ""could be better"":When looking up recipes, the Echo 8 displays them one at a time. It is exactly like an Echo Dot, except there is a picture - the screen could be utilized to show multiple possibilities and cut the browsing time down tenfold. There is no provision to enter and save your own recipes, my wife still gets out her Ipad and uses that.  Amazon says there are thousands of skills, but the majority of them are at best, kinda lame (having the Gordon Ramsey skill make rude comments about food was funny for about 15 seconds.) Like the recipe function, very few of the skills are optimized to work with a screen in a helpful way... this is an area that really disappointed us. I was expecting something that could work more like a tablet in capabilities.We have multiple Alexa Dots throughout the house, and their capabilities have grown tremendously over the past two years. Many of the capabilities were unexpected and very useful, such as Guard and geofencing, both of which we now use daily.  I suspect, and hope, that the Echo Show 8 evolves in the same way."
"Not Just A Glorified Alarm Clock...I have been reading the Amazon Echo 5 reviews for quite sone time and trying to make up my mind on if I should buy it or not.  When I saw the pre-order starting for Echo Show 8 I was not sure if I was going to get it or not but I put my name on the list anyway.  Before the Echo Show arrived I planned on it just basically being a clock for me but I was wrong!  I had every plan of holding onto my alarm clock even after I set up the Echo Show in my apartment but it did not work out that way.  I saw the “skill” for this speaker to play my Apple Music so that was the first thing that I tried because I wanted to see if it had good speaker quality like my Wonderboom blue tooth speaker which is my usual way of listening to my playlists.  It exceeded my expectations and since I set it up I have not turned on my Wonderboom speaker at all which is amazing to me because I like quality sound.  Even stopping the music for a few minutes is easily done with a voice command.  I am, and have been a longtime fan of everything Apple.  I do have an Amazon Kindle Fire but thought that would be it for me with Amazon’s devices.  I thought that I would have as much of a “problem” as quite a few others had with the things that come across  the Echo’s screen but to my surprise it is not bothersome at all to me.  I have long liked Apple’s customer service and when I purchased my smart tv and my sound bar I saw that one of the services Amazon provided was customer support.  My friend had set up the tv and the soundbar for me and he relied heavily on this service that Amazon provided in setting it up with the soundbar.  While I was confident that I would not need to use this service when I set up the Echo Show I figured that it would be fairly easy but was happy that if a problem arises and I cannot figure it out that I could always call and find an answer from Amazon.  I saw that on Black Friday (today) that the selling price is lower than I bought it for ($99) but that was to be expected.  I just decided that I would write a review on this product since it seemed ironic to me that I chose Amazon over Apple in this type of device.  I was seriously thinking I would stay with my plan of buying the Apple Home Pod because of the critical reviews of “ads” on the Show but I see I am wrong with that.  Since I have set this unit up I see that it has surpassed my expectations because it is a great product that not only has great sound, it also has good clarity on the screen.  The only problem I have encountered with the Echo Show, and it is not much of  a problem, is to remember to say Alexa instead of Siri.  Since I have only a small efficiency apartment (400 square feet) I do not need another Echo Show but if I did I would not hesitate to purchase another one of these units.  For me to write something like this for an Amazon product it is a pleasant surprise because I myself rely heavily on all reviews because they are very valuable in deciding what to purchase since I am on a small fixed income and I figured there are so many reviews of the Echo Show that I wouldn’t have to bother with that but I changed my mind after seeing this is a wonderful product.  Thank you Amazon for giving such good quality for such a small purchase!  I would not hesitate to even buy one as a present for somebody if they wanted something like this.UPDATE-I decided to call customer service since I was not happy with seeing the selling price go from $129.99 to $99 and now to $79.  I usually never call for things like this but I was very happy with the agent telling me that I will get a promotional discount which is very good for me since I am on a very small fixed income.  Thank you Amazon your customer service is always good!"
Why can't you have a date on the home screen.I installed 8 today and it does NOT allow you to show a date on the home screen.In fact now my 5 doesn't now show the date.Want to see a date...ready for this....say Alexa show me the weather and it will briefly show the date....i don't have the energy to say anything more
"Great first impressions.Just received the echo show 8 todayFirst impressions:screen: great picture quality for this size of device. Touch seems very responsive. Our cameras all look great on it.Sound: it's ok it's but not as good as our echo 2nd generation.Pros: we can view our ring doorbell, our wyze cams, and our nanit plus this feature was the main reason for upgrading from the echo 2nd gen. We love that while listening to Spotify it shows the lyrics on screen."
"Alexa is looking pretty!I replaced the original ""Alexa"" we had in our living room with this echo show. At first I felt guilty removing Alexa, especially since she was one of the original beta tester echoes. But Alexa had been knocked off of the end table one too many times by the cats, leaving her top a bit crooked and wonky. Although she did still sound great, sometimes she had a bit of trouble hearing and we found ourselves yelling and repeating ourselves one too many times, it was time to send her to the old hobby closet.This echo show 8 is very nice, it was super easy to set up and the picture quality and sound are excellent. Alexa responds quickly and I don't have to yell or repeat myself making my neighbors think a crazy lady lives here. I'm also happy I chose the 8 instead of the smaller 5. I enjoy the screen size, and along with a nice magnetic swivel stand I bought to go with it, it looks and fits great on the end table. It would also work great on the kitchen counter or anywhere else in the house.This echo works great with our security system, I just ask Alexa to ""show me -name of camera-"" and it's super easy to make calls and check your calendar and emails if you need to. Running smart home controls is also easy to do. Touch screen and voice control are both very responsive. I also love the slide lock button to block the camera when it's not in use, it kept me from having to place one more piece of black tape over a camera lens!The lighting also dims (can turn feature off in settings) as it gets darker so it doesn't light up the room at night. However you can still see the time dimly lit from across the room, I like this feature so I haven't checked to see if you can remove the time from showing when it's dark.I'm still getting to know what I can and cannot do with this echo show, but so far I'm loving it and I have no regrets whatsoever with my purchase."
"Not for me.I own a Echo (1st gen), Google Nest Hub, Ecobee 4 and echo dot. Just recently got this. This is the my lest liked smart device in of the previously mentioned devices that have voice recognition. Alexa is not as intuitive as Google for voice integration for me. The larger screen of the show 8 is something that was suprising to me. I actually like it less than I do the smaller screens on the google Nest Hub and show 5. I got it because I thought I wanted a bigger screen and a better speaker. Both of these reason didn't pan out. If I wasn't so lazy I would return it for a second Google Nest hub or a straight echo speaker.The Far field mics on most Alexa devices are great including this one. Generally they have been better than Google devices in my experience, but what Alexa does with what you says has fallen behind google in my opinion."
"One major flaw, otherwise good.(As of 12-25-2019)  I just received and installed the Echo Show 8 several days ago. It soon upgraded itself to the latest software. I had read many Show reviews, including complaints about the constant ""Things to Try"" notices on the screen. Also read a couple reviews that claimed to instruct how to turn this ""feature"" off.So, after getting the Show 8 going, there were the never-ending things to try on the screen. So I tried the steps others had earlier listed. NONE work now at this time.  Over several hours I tried everything, no joy.So I got Amazon Help online and started the Chat (with ""Tech""). After 10-15 minutes of delay and ""Thanks for waiting"" and ""Let me check on that"", etc., the expert said the actual tech folks said that at present there is NO WAY to turn that off. But they would surely take my ""suggestion"" into account for future upgrades. UNBELIEVABLE!If this will not irritate you, the Show 8 is otherwise a very powerful tech addition to your Echo house (I have 9 other Echo devices at home).IF they do allow the ""Things to Try"" feature to be removed in the future I will update this...1/1/20 Indeed if you turn on ""Do Not Disturb"" it will no longer display the maddening ""Things to Try"", although if the device is doing something for you TTT will activate during that time. Device is slow to shift gears but after a few seconds it will return to the screen with only the clock and a moon icon. If you have personal pictures as a background, they WILL continue under DND.  Now a great device, lol..."
"Bought a 2nd one and really like the helpful “Try, Alexa---” exact wording feature.Echo Show 8 - HD 8"" smart display with Alexa is something that I bought specifically to watch the streams from my Wyze cameras.  It does that very well but it is the “Try, ‘Alexa ----’ “  feature that some people find annoying that I like so much that I purchased a second device.The screen changes with different news items or informational comments and across the bottom of the screen a tag line shows the exact phrasing to use if one wants to know more.  This helps to avoid frustration when struggling to phrase a question or command that Alexa will immediately understand.  The “Try,’ Alexa ----’ ” is also a great prompt for those who are just getting used to AI and not quite sure of how to use it or what to say.I have Alexa Echo audio devices in every room along with the other leading AI assistant.  I find that I can avoid frustration when one of the AI assistants fails to understand me, or can not help me with that yet, to be able to ask the other and usually get a response.Now that displays are becoming the norm I decided to trade up.  I find it really helps to see a visualization of the response. I particularly like seeing lyrics to songs.  It is also nice to be able to set the home screen to present what one’s wants.  The sound on this 8” Echo Show is excellent.Echo Show 8 - HD 8"" smart display with Alexa is an ideal size for a kitchen counter or nightstand.  It’s a handy device that makes smart home control or information gathering even easier."
"So far unimpressed.So far unimpressed and likely will return this.  Bought it primarily for the Allrecipes feature and the claim online that you could put your own recipes into Allrecipes and pull them up on the Echo Show. But the “reimagined” skill doesn’t have a login capability and just trying to find a simple recipe came up with no results.Dropped it another star because it cannot multitask! If you are playing music through it via Bluetooth and ask it to open a web browser, it stops the music AND disconnects from my phone!  It's almost 2020 and this device has fewer features than a 2006 phone"
"Quite an Upgrade Over the ECHO.We have been using an ECHO unit for about 3 years and have been very happy with it. With the recent version 2 upgrade to the ECHO Show, and with the recent addition of grandchildren living 8 hours away, we decided to try the Show 8 out.The unit installation was a super simple plug-an-play using the Alexa app. Amazon has certainly made the start up for their products super simple. We moved the ECHO to the master bedroom, and the ECHO Dot to a different location.After 2 weeks we are VERY happy with it. We are able to do visual phone calls with our son and family (they upgraded to a Show 8, also). We have  added the Recipe Speak skill, uploaded a lot of our recipes, and like the visual functionality. We use Our Groceries (we love it) and can now get a visual on what is on the list(s). There are other things we are trying as we learn what can be done.The sounds seems to be very good, also. The better sound may be a function of the unit sitting in a corner up against two walls.Why 4 versus 5 stars?  The ECHO Show 8's bottom is set so that the screen tilts backward slightly; there is no way to adjust this tilt. Because of the location of our unit we either have to stand up to look straight into the screen for a phone call or prop the back up with a small block so we can sit down. Adjustable stands are available, and we will order one, but I think that some type of tilt device, even a very simple one, should come with the unit."
"Keep it or dump it?The original unit had to be replaced before the end of the first week.  The  echo 8 kept cutting out especially when listening to news and music.  Instead of amazon replacing it with a new Echo Show 8,  I was sent a unit identified as refurbished.  How they could have refurbished units within days of the release of a new product is unclear.The replacement had a different problem.  After being on for 15 or 20 minutes, the Echo 8 refused to respond to an Alexa command. It simply stayed on with what was playing even when screaming Alexa right over it.  The Amazon technician I called couldn’t believe it either. We spent nearly an hour going back to the beginning with restoring to factory settings.  We agreed to keep it playing and have her call me after 30 minutes to see if the Alexa command could get it to stop playing.  She did call back as promised and, guess what, the fix took.  Alexa did her job.  I praised the technician for her expertise and effort and thought a new day had begun.Except it hadn’t.  The next day it was as if nothing had been done.  The Echo 8 refused to respond to the off or stop command, making it necessary to disconnect the power.A day later I am still wondering what to.  Should I call tech support and go through another remedial effort which will probably fail or should I ask for a third unit, one which is new and not refurbished?  Or how about a third option: request a refund and send it back?  I would easily opt for choice 3 if the picture and sound weren’t so great.  They are outstanding.  To be or not to be."
"To the Echo Show product developers.To the Echo Show Developers...having been a very loyal Amazon user for over 10 years and I have to say that I am extremely disappointed and frustrated with the Echo Show product and the Amazon support of this product.On the surface the potential for the product is tremendous...however, for whatever reason, Amazon has chosen NOT to provide any documentation on the products capabilities nor any instructions on how to correctly use and take advantabe of all of the product capabilities.  In the first two days with the product, I have had to call Amazon Support 4 times to get instructions on how Echo Show works with Amazon Photo. to do basic things like upload a photos, creating photo albums and adding additional photos to these photo albums...and these are all fundamentally basic capabilities.  In total, I have spent more than 3 hours on these 4 support calls because after about 30-45 mins of fumbling around, the Amazon support person has told me that they are really not that familiar with the Show product or with Amazon Photo product and they transfer me to someone else...who has more knowledge of the products.  These new support persons have access to ""step by step"" instructions (or can direct me to the Help section) with these ""step by step"" instructions to do specific tasks.  But even then, they cannot find or direct me to any ""step by step"" help to work with things like Photo Albums...If this Echo Show product is going to really be successful, Amazon needs to provide users like me with documentation on all of the products features and ""step by step"" instructions on how to take advantage and use these features.  For a product with such great potential, I am about to throw it out because it has been so difficult and frustrating to use.Jim Paynter314-308-5858jimpaynte9@gmail.com"
"Defective Unit.Apparently Amazon is having problems with their Echo Show 8 which is why I'm having to wait until after Christmas for my second Echo Show 8. The one I got today was defective right out of the box.I have to admit I was very surprised and sadden as I love my Echo Show 5 which works like a champ. I'm not sure why a larger version should have problems but I wish now I'd bought another Echo Show 5 instead as I would have a working unit for my living room now instead of a defective one.The problem seems to be the software. It keeps hanging up and the only way around it is to disconnect the power and then repower the unit and hope you can get through the part that hung up on you before. One menu required moving my finger up, to scroll down, instead of the usual moving the finger down to scroll down. That was totally weird.I am disappointed because I ordered the two Echo Shows as my main Christmas presents to myself. I wanted the 10s but I read they weren't very good for the almost double price. And the 8 is really big enough for what I want it to do--if it would do it.So my Christmas tree isn't going to have much under it this year which is a shame as this will probably be my last Christmas due to cancer. At least the Echo Show, due after Christmas, is from a different batch so maybe it will work right out of the box like my Echo 5."
"Great for the kitchen and general use.There’s a lot of devices out there. Almost too many at times. But the good news is that usually means a lot of variety. The trick is selecting what works and applies to your needs without getting sucked into marketing and pointless features. With all that said, I’d say the echo 8 comes right where we wanted to land as a family.We originally purchased an echo 5 on Black Friday. While it’s great for the price, it’s small and the speakers are lacking when it comes to playing audio with any volume. The 8 definitely delivers over the 5 in terms of audio quality. Much clearer and robust.Larger screen is a big plus with better quality picture. This isn’t a device I’d expect or demand 4K in. 1080 is fine. Nothing is generally grainy or hard to see. It’s the right size for a kitchen without being excessive and space demanding.Performance wise it’s fast. Does a great job with home automation and commands. I like the shutter for the camera and button to cut the mic off.The only ding I’d give it is it should have the option of being a true smart hub. I would love to attach my z wave devices to it and remove the entirety of a secondary controller. I know the larger show does have some of these functions but at a much larger size it wasn’t what we wanted. Add in the extra cost, the show 8 was a winner for us.I’d recommend it to anyone who wants a good kitchen companion. The off white color is a nice compliment to kitchens. Reminds me of a typical appliance but attractive."
"It works great, BUT......The Echo Show 8 works just as described. The voice recognition is great, The screen is crisp and it works just fine, BUT. And that is a BIG BUT!!! It is a BIG data drain. Installing it has doubled my monthly usage. I have a 250 GB plan and I am struggling today to not go over my limit.  Normal usage without the Echo Show 8 was about 100 GB per month and has been that way for more than a year. But since I installed the Show 8, about 1 month ago, I am at 222 GB at this moment and I have 6 days left in my usage month. I received the ECHO Show 8 on Dec 7th, and installed it soon after that. I shut it down three days ago to conserve data.  So if you are on a data plan with a limit,, BUYER BEWARE!!!"
"""Try Alexa""?  Really?We had seven Echos in our house, and then we received a new Echo Show 8 for Christmas.Pro:  Pretty good sound.  ""Show me the front door"" works with our Ring camera.Con: There's no way to disable the frigging ""Try Alexa"" rolling advertisement on the home screen.  It sucks.  It REALLY sucks.  And Amazon doesn't have an option to pay more to remove the advertisement.  Imagine if your toaster was continuously (24 hours a day, 7 days a week) trying to persuade you to make new and different kinds of toast.  And you had PAID your own MONEY for that toaster.My next home automation speaker is going to be from Google.  I'm tired of the continuous up-sell from these bozos.Thanks a lot, Amazon."
"Not ready for prime time!I actually dislike all of versions of the show as they all have the annoying ""Try Alexa"" screen that you can't get rid of.  If they allowed you to get rid of that, this would be a five star review.  Unfortunately, I don't ever see that changing.  My other big complaint is the clock.  The 8"" version is right in between the 5"" and the 10"", but the time is really small in the upper right corner and cannot be changed like the 5"" version.  Amazon should have the same options as the 5"" versions.  I just want this as a larger clock during the day.  However, you almost need glasses to see the time from a distance as it is way too small.  They really did not think this echo show out.  Designers of this really need to go back to the drawing board and rethink this one out before updating the next version of software.  I will probably end up sending this one back and waiting for them to fix these issues if they ever do before purchasing again.  In the mean-time, I would stay with the 5"" or the 10"" for now.  The sound is good, but the 10"" is still better.  BTW, for those of you who do want to use this in a bedroom on a nightstand next to your bed, beware that dark mode is so bright that it will pretty much light up the room with a warm glow.  There really is no way to get this screen to dim past a certain point.  Still pretty bright."
"Don't expect to see your saved recipes on the allrecipes skill.I bought the Echo show primarily because I have used Allrecipes for years and have many saved recipes I use regularly.  Unfortunately, there is no way to bring up your saved favorites.  If you say the exact name of the recipe you want to make, it will give you something entirely different or will say it doesn't understand you.I decided to return it, but changed my mind:  Because we have thousands of photos on Amazon, they are showing on the Echo Show all the time; we love this feature.  We're seeing pictures we had totally forgotten about.  Every time we walk through the kitchen we both check to see what's showing now!I sure would love it if they'd fix Allrecipes so I could actually use it, though."
"Great Kitchen Assistant.This device is front and center on our kitchen counter. I use it primarily to pull up recipes, listen to music and turn on/off a variety of lights/devices in our home which are on smart plugs. I've had it for a little less than a month and am by no means familiar with all of it's capabilities.For online recipes it's terrific. I can ask it to find a recipe for X on website Y (or just look across the web), and it'll display all the relevant recipes. I can scroll through them, then pick one to see the details. It even links the ingredients to the shopping list in the Alexa app. When using a recipe, the display stays open and you can easily scroll through the different steps. It sits at an angle which makes it easy to read ( I didn't get a stand). Much better than using my tablet, which times out after a few minutes, so I have to keep logging in.For music, it visually displays all the available playlists, which I can scroll through and pick one. It displays the current song and performer. So much easier than using an Echo Dot. I was using a Dot together with my phone; this combines the capabilities of the two.I bought this to experiment with before buying some others as gifts for family members. Ultimately I want to use these as an easy way to visually connect with family."
"PERFECT SWEET SPOT ECHO SHOW! Great size and sound! Bargain for its price!The Echo Show 8 is the perfect size Echo Show for an area thats not too big, but still a main/populated area of your living space. The price of the full sized Echo Show runs $230 and $199 on sale, while the Echo Show 8 is $130 full price and $80 with free Echo Dot when on sale. The $80 price tag is insanely good for the speaker and screen quality.While I do wish it was more customizable like others have said as for removing the ‘Try This’ im sure it will happen eventually and every single person mentioning it is redundant. The Echo Show 5 is a worthless paper weight as for its speaker and screen size, its smaller then most current phone screens, and sounds like trash. As for a bedroom clock, or background music, or digital picture frame for the bedroom it may serve a purpose, it doesnt have a place anywhere else really. The Echo Show 8, while only being 2.5” bigger, is a perfect size for a main room that doesnt have a big enough space to dedicate to the full size Echo Show, or as a cheaper alternative, or as a secondary Echo Show. I will strongly recommend this to everyone interested in Echo Show devices, as I cannot justify more then double the price for 2” more of screen, and almost the same exact speaker performance this is the sweet spot!"
"Beware offer to Trade-In (updated 1/9/20).Love this Echo Show.  It has a  much larger screen and I can easily read it from across the room.  The only issue I have is that I am disappointed with the Upgrade and Trade-in discount which offered me $30 instant credit if I sent in my old unit.  My old unit sat untouched on a table for a year.  It was like new out of the box when I sent it in.  I wrapped it in bubble wrap and newspaper and dropped it off at UPS.  Now they rejected the suggested $30 discount and have charged my credit card.  The reason?  Scratches.  Absolutely no way there was a single scratch on that unit.  I'll be interested in seeing the condition it's in when it is returned.  I won't every use that Ugrade and Trade-in offer again.Update:  After a couple of weeks I just received my old unit back.  I was anxious to see the ""scratches"" that they claimed were the reason they didn't accept it.  Of course, there weren't ANY, not a single scratch.  But the best part, wait for it... is that they returned it without the cord.  So now, if I want to sell it I have to buy a $15 cord for it.  This trade-in program is a scam and I am really surprised Amazon is okay with it.  Basically, they lure you in with a higher amount and ask you to ok ahead if they feel it is worth less (which it always is, I'm sure).  If like me you don't agree to take a lower value then they just ship it back to you.  Beware!"
"Love it!I had a Google Home, it was, at best, okay. But it can't compare to my new Echo Show 8.I found that when I ask it a question, it’s response on answers is far superior to what I was getting with my Google device. Plus it hears me better. The Google worked fine as long as I was sitting next to it but if I was on the other side of the room I had to shout at it for it to respond. That is not a problem with my Amazon device, I can use my normal speaking voice from anywhere in the room and it works perfectly.The sound is amazing. The speakers are probably 80% of the device so they are large they with a clear sound And offer a good amount of bass. It's really nice to just sit down and say “Alexa play Frank Sinatra.“ And it sounds just wonderful.Plus it works with Amazon prime video, I can watch movies on it, and they sound great because of the wonderful speakers.No problem integrating it with my smart switches and outlets. I come home, I say hello to it it, turns on the correct lights. In the morning when I tell it good morning it gives me the weather, tells me what time it is, reads the news, and lets me know what is  on my calendar for the day. It’s fabulous!"
"Good device, flawed software by Amazon.The Echo Show 8 is a good piece of hardware marred by a software design that makes you scratch your head, largely because the numerous requests and feedback from users of the larger Show is largely ignored in this implementation.The display is great, the built in pictures are also great, and the scrolling weather, news and other functions work well.The issues.1. There is no way to have a larger clock in ""standard"" mode.  It's a small little clock in the corner, and even if you turn off all the info scrolling options like news, weather, etc. It stays this small little clock with a bunch of empty screen space. Do not disturb allows for a larger clock, but is a poor implementation of allowing it as it literally shuts everything else off.2. Do not disturb in the menu says it turns the screen off, but actually leaves the screen on and just gives you a larger clock.  It should turn the screen off as stated and there should be a separate mode for displaying a larger clock.3. Night mode is still WAY too bright and there's no way to adjust it or dim it down. Nor any option to configure it so that night mode is just a clock, no picture.Now, if this was a first try, these things would be forgivable as they worked through what the end user wanted.  The issue?  The Google Home Hub has been out for over a year and literally has NONE of these issues as they got all of these wrongs right.  Want a full screen clock.  Check.  Want a proper dnd mode? Check. A night time mode that properly dims the display?  Check.The fact that the Show 8 misses badly on all of these is just not acceptable."
Love my echo show 8.Received today 5 minutes later linked to WiFi and Alexa love this thing would give it 6 stars if I could
"Worth the extra money over the 5.Ive tried all the echos that have a screen and the echo 8 is more impressive than i was expecting. The echo 5 is a great alarm clock replacement. The size allows it to fit well on a night stand and its handy for smart device control, podcast, video chat but its limited in what videos it can play and the sound isnt anything to write home about. The echo 8 breaks free of all the negative aspects of the echo 5. If you are looking for something to watch video on and listen to music the echo 8 is a much better choice. The volume is louder and the bass is surprisingly good for this type of device. You can feel the bass. It also playa hulu and more video options than the echo 5. Its not a fire tv replacement as not all video apps work on the echo shows. The big echo obviously has a larger screen and its significantly more expensive. If watching video is your top concern stick to the 10 inch or the echo 8. If having a bedside smart device to control smart devices, wake you up and use for communication the echo 5 is the best option. The echo 5 is surprisingly unobtrusive on the nightstand where as the echo 8 is pretty noticeable. The echo 8 is a great value at the current sale price. If your on the fence buy it! You won’t regret it. I wish i had a need for another given the price."
"Much better than the 5 inch.I bought the 5 inch on Prime day. I like it. It's a great bedside clock and it does things that need a screen, like finding a book or music playlist. But the screen is small. The 8 seemed huge when I opened the box. Just huge. But it's a very nice screen, and very suitable for the free Prime Video stuff. I think the overall experience is getting better. With the screen, I can find Audible books fairly easily. The books synch  pretty well with my smartphone. I like that there is no downloading, they just stream. A lot of the videos that come up are interesting. You can hone things to what you want like the stock market or NFL scores, etc. If I want to hear a song, I can generally just ask for it, but it helps to have the Unlimited service, not the free one. Sometimes when I ask for a shopping suggestion, I get really good and in-depth information. But not always. I use it in the kitchen, so it's great for timers and I'd like to find good recipes. It was worth it, for me. Honestly, my $25 Dot seems pretty worthless now. The Dot had decent audio, but this is quite good. My outdoor video cameras come up OK on the Alexa Fire device, but not so smooth on the Echos."
"No Middle Child Syndrome Here - Step up from 5 and 10 &amp; gives the benefits of both.The Echo 8 may be getting a bad rap being in the middle of two other pretty cool Echo Shows. But for me, having multiple ""5s"" around, this larger screen and even bigger sound brought me joy. Video calling was great with the 5, but wow, video calling on the 8 is really cool and requires less shifting the device around to keep up with us folks constantly moving around. My only regret was purchasing this on a pre-order bundled with another Echo Show 5 at a discount. But ultimately, cost me a lot of money. Suddenly Amazon dropped the price of this one to less than $100. Kind of screwed all those who pre-ordered it at full price. Lesson learned - I will not be the early bird on new devices, because that ate my future Echo Show 10 money. Lo and behold, during Black Friday, the Echo Show 10 dropped to $149, and I jumped on it. A month later, and I am still frustrated with the full size 10 and have a return request open because it drops constantly and becomes unresponsive. The Echo 8 has blown the 10 away and sounds just as good. Disappointed in the full version, and loving the small one as a clock, the 8 has won me over as having the best of both worlds."
"Alexa do you understand me?!?I’ve had real problems with Alexa understanding me. I don’t speak with a heavy accent (maybe Alexa thinks I should since I live in Southwestern Virginia). Grew up in Pennsylvania and if any would have a Philly accent. But I think I’m pretty neutral.Also, I put the show in the kitchen because I thought it would be a great assistant for recipes. It’s not bad at this, but I’ve had a hard time getting Alexa to search websites more broadly as Google does. Seems most focused on just a few food websites which limits its ability to find recipes I know exist (and would like to add to my favorites).All together a somewhat disappointing experience."
Get Rid Of  Try asking Alexa  at the bottom of the screen.Why can’t I get rid of the “try asking Alexa” at the bottom of the screen????  It is quite annoying.  That’s the biggest problem I have with it. Sent it back!!
"Versatile Size Echo Show.Device is fun, many features, like watching movies, playing music with lyrics show.  It's a great size to fit on a desk or kitchen counter and the sound quality is pretty good, it has some bass.Some pain points:-Issues making video calls (probably a configuration on my end, but can't figure out)-'Try Alexa...' text at bottom of screen gets in the way, seems to be clutter that you can't turn off in settings*Contacted support about the 'Try Alexa' text, they said it cannot be turned off right now, but were appreciative of the feedback, but could not comment if or when the feature to disable might be release; it seems to be a common feedback point, so hopefully it's considered."
"No instructions?I think it needs better instructions.  It is probably awesome if you know how to use it, but we have no idea how to use this, or what it's capable of."
"Worth it if discounted.Probably worth it when it goes on sale, and the quality packaging makes it a great gift. The hardware build feels excellent. The screen is bright in sunlight and automatically dims to a night mode when dark. Sound is different (I'd say better) compared to my echo. Drop-in and video calling features are pretty useful when communicating with family members; most of us put our phones on silent nowadays so another way to reach them is always a plus. I mainly got this to integrate with my Ring doorbell - so far so good (the Ring cloud is a bit slow sometimes, but that's not this product's fault).Cons: I put this in my bedroom, so my main use as part of my daily routine is to check the time and the weather before I leave for work. So I do wish the clock can be made full screen both normally as well as in night mode. I'd also like to be able to give it context (i.e. if it's between 7a and 9a, always show today's weather details, and show a large clock the rest of the time). These are simple software fixes, so hopefully it'll get rolled out soon because the hardware seems well made."
"Getting used to the new Echo Show 8.Received the new Echo Show 8.  It was easy to set up and the app was easy to set up and understand. Everyday I learn something new that Echo can do. The screen quality is good,  but wish the small print at the bottom of the page telling you things was slightly larger. The voice does not always get what I ask correctly. So far have used it to check on the weather each day, play a couple of short games.  Listen to national news from CBS .  I guess my main dislike are the apps you have to pay for monthly to have an enhanced experience. I enjoy asking about What occurred this day in History each day.  Essentially my impressions so far are favorable."
"Seal was broken!So naturally I question as to whether this is a NEW show 8 or a USED return.The seal wasn't just split, it has some pulls and tugs in it like a knife was used.As for the Echo Show 8, I love it.  I also have one 10"" and two of the 5"".The 8 is a nice size with a clear display.  Sound quality is good.I have all of them set with a personal photo and turn off ""Rotate Continuously"".  I also turn off all of the notifications I'm not interested in.One of the 5's I use as an alarm clock on my nightstand.  It's perfect for viewing my Blink cameras inside and outside of our home while I'm in bed.  The size is just perfect for my nightstand.  It has a small footprint, but big enough to see and use the screen clearly.The other 5 I have in my office.  Again, this has a big enough screen for all my uses.  And the sound quality is good as well.And the 10 we have in our kitchen, which gets the most use.  The 10 is not overbearing, the size is just right for our use.All in all, I love the Echo Shows and their ease of use."
"It's (almost) all good...It's (almost) all good doing the things that an Echo or a Dot can do, but some re-thinking needs to be done on what the display displays and how you set it up.  Its as though the designers pictured it only being used on a desk and not as an alarm clock  or, perhaps sitting under a television or other tythings that people could have thought to do with it.But it would be nice if there were a way to get rid of the ""Suggestions"" that keep turning up on the lower part of the display.It wold also be 100% better if you could make it act like a regular ol' digital clock and only chnge screens when you ask it to do something.  Unlike the the Show 5, you can't change clock faces so you are stuck with the clock face that is too small to read from across a room.  There is a larger clock face that would be OK if you could keep it on the display instead of it changing to the small one periodically  no matter what settings you change.Virtually all settings must be one on the display itself.  It would be useful to be able to change the settings from the Alexa App."
"Better than Echo 1st &amp; 2nd Gen. and much better than any Echo Dot--a BUY!I bought this with a sense of guilt because I already had Echos in the bedroom and living room and Dots in the bathroom and den. But, am I ever happy that I made the purchase.  I placed it in the living room instead of the 1st generation Echo (one that I pre-ordered before any were even shipped!).  The sound quality was MUCH more to my liking,  The Echos, especially the Dots, sound rather muddy to me, even with my excellent hearing aids (I have high-frequency drop-off).  But, this 8"" Show is very clear, and it easily fills a living room-dining room area.  I like that the screen dims in a dark room, meaning that I might splurge on a second Show for my bedroom to get better sound.  I also like that when I play selections from TuneIn Radio, the artwork shows on the screen. But, there are times when I would like to just return the screen to a persistent plain one, like whenit shows time and weather.  That's my only real objection.  I am about to make a demo of Alexa products to a senior living community, and be assured that I will feature this Echo Show.  This is a definite BUY!"
"Highly Recommended. Amazing!I think just the Echo Dot 3rd generation is amazing! Then my mom bought me this wonderful Echo Show 8"". It does so much. You can see song lyrics. You can look up recipes. You get a video of the recipe. You can just scroll the screen for the ingredients or Alexa will read them to you. You can save the recipes in your favorites. The Echo Show 8"" is really amazing with the sturdy magnetic stand they sell for it. Echo Show 8"" even scrolls stuff across the screen giving you ideas you can try and not just for the Echo Show 8"" either. Now because of this item, I know so many more things I can do with my Echo Dot 3rd generation! The Show new everything about me. Integrated easily with my Dots. I learned you can ask Alexa who am I? Then if she doesn't know, she'll tell them who's Echo it is and ask you your name. Then when you tell her ,she'll ask if you want her to set up a voice profile you say yes. Then she will start calling you by your name. You can do that both on the Echo Show 8"" and the Echo Dot. Also with the Echo Show as long as you don't close your camera, you can call check in on kids pets etc and actually see them."
"Stop &amp; read! The ads aren’t even bad at all!!We personally LOVE the echo show! We stayed away at first because of the reviews about the “ads” it’s shows- but honestly there’s nothing inconvenient about them! I like that world wide things come across the screen, when our packages will/have been delivered, news and suggestions of “Try, Alexa....” and comes up with with different ways to use Alexa! The music plays really well on it, i love being able to ask Alexa to play music while I do dishes or cleaning around the house, especially when i can ask her to play a specific song! Even the suggestions on “learn how to make this food!” Which gives us more suggestions on foods I haven’t even thought about. Plus the weather for the day and just minor things Alexa can do! I think it’s great it rotates with different things and we can still see the time at the top corner. I’ve been recommending it to everyone! Main reason we bought it was so we could see our ring cameras and the quality is amazing! (Note: we started with the compact version and didn’t love it, only because it was so small. The 8” is way better and we love it so much more!)"
"Great but needs some updates.I wish you could customize the home screen more. To include the digital display of the clock. I want to have it bigger on the screen and I want to be able to dim it or make it brighter. My old alarm clock had a bigger display and I was able to dim the clock to a setting I preferred. Not so with Echo 8.Sound is excellent, and screen is great quality.Camera points to the sky, why? Awkward when doing video chat. I like the feature of sliding cover camera. Great feature.Having difficulty with Alexa in general when playing music on a speaker group. The only way I can make it work is to say, ""Alexa play music on -speaker group-"". I can't tell Alexa to play a particular genre or band on a speaker group. It just doesn't work.You Tube is NOT on Echo 8. It tells you to open it via internet browser ""Firefox"". Awkard when using YouTube that way. I can't type anything in search because there is NO KEYBOARD! How can I search for a video?I hope there will be more updates and improvements. Still a great item"
"Not ready for prime time -doesn't integrate well with Blink XT2.After wasting much time and effort I discovered that the Blink XT2 and Blink Skill does not work reliably with Show 8 in either Best or Enhance resolution. A real bummer as the Saver resolution is not satisfactory for me. Integration with the Blink cameras is the main reason for purchasing the Show 8.When I ask Alexa to show me the camera I usually get the OK response, a short delay then camera sound but no video. Sometimes Alexa says OK then shortly announces ""Something must have gone wrong"".Blink reportedly has actually been aware of the problem for months and is promising a fix in the future but is not saying when. If it is taking so long to fix it must be a major flaw or it is a ""back burner"" project for them. I have not seen anything in either the Blink or Show documentation/advertising that lets customers know NOT to expect integration in anything but the ""Saver"" mode.Needless to say I am not a pleased customer. I would give the Show 8 only one star based on the problem with Blink but other features work well for the most part so far."
"Disappointed, Doesn't Do What They Claim It Will Do.I picked up a Show 8 recently. Liked it enough that I decided to get two for a paired stereo setup, a function which Amazon claims you can do with this device.  Unfortunately, I found it just doesn't work. If it has for others, would love to hear about it. Spent hours on my own troubleshooting. Then tonight spent an hour on the phone with Amazon tech support. That's a lot of time wasted only to find that there just doesn't seem to be any way to get two Show 8's working as a stereo pair. Since I have no idea if its a bug, or one or both units malfunctioning, I'll now have to return all of it, including 2 Dots that came with the Show 8's on a holiday sale/promotion. Very disappointing. Hope they work out the bugs and get it working as is promised. Seems like a device with a lot of potential, but for me it was just wasted time.EDIT:  After hours and hours of wasted troubleshooting an Amazon staff member got back to me on their device forum advising Amazon's info on their Compatible Echo Devices page was WRONG!  Wasted a ton of time, money, and now even more time for returns because of Amazon's misinformation about the stereo pairing for these!  Ask me how annoyed I am at this moment?? Nice of Amazon to apologize on their forum for my ""inconvenience"". Lot of good that does me!!!  P.S. While they've now corrected their compatibility for stereo pairing page they've left questions answered here that still contain the wrong information. I hope others don't go thru a problem because of that. Merry XMAS to you to Amazon :("
"The sound and size are perfect!Prior to purchasing the Echo Show, I had the Echo Spot and was looking to trade it in for something newer. The Echo Shows were on sale and I was offered decent money to trade in the Echo Spot from Amazon, so I went for it. I wasn’t sure if I should get the Echo Show 5 or 8 to use as a replacement alarm clock and radio in the bedroom. I went with the Echo Show 8 and I am so happy with the purchase. I was nervous that it might be too big or too loud. The size is perfect and it sits on a night stand with a lamp next to the bed. The sound is amazing!!! The bass is also incredible! Best part is at night I don’t like the radio too loud and the Echo Show 8 has the perfect low sound too. The camera shut off feature is key. The dimming feature works great so the light doesn’t bother you while sleeping. I highly recommend the Echo Show 8 and don’t be afraid that it’s too much for a bedroom. You’ll be able to have a dance party during the day and listen to soothing music as you sleep at night. One of my favorite Amazon purchases to date!"
"Great in-between option.Excellent upgrade from first gen Echo Show. I use this in our master bedroom for typical Alexa stuff (controlling lights/lamps in our room, playing music, weather checks, “show me the front door” with Ring doorbell, news updates, so on). I can confirm the speaker and sound from Echo Show 8 is better in absolutely every way compared to first gen. This is obviously expected as Amazon has upped their game in audio. I have the second gen Echo Show in our kitchen and love these two Echo Shows. I think back to 2014 when I first got my hands on the original Echo. This whole ecosystem has evolved so well for the most part (they do have some duds in the line-up). If you’re considering the Echo Show 5 versus the 8, I would recommend the 8. It’s not going to take up nearly as much room as the Echo Show, and the difference in sound quality and extra few inches of screen versus the 5 is obvious. It’s a good in-between option and I’m thrilled Amazon launched this version. I was also thrilled to use Amazon’s trade-in platform to send in my original Echo Show and apply the gift card and discount toward the 8."
"Big step up from Show 5. I have both.When the sale offered the 8.1 plus a free 3rd gen dot, for $20 over the  show 5 , I said -H - E- DOUBLE HOCKEY STICKS YES!1) much higher resolution2) vision of Ring PRO so much better. Especially if you now need glasses!3) no washed out side angle view (ie 5)4) so much heavier, as you now have 2 great speakers!5) picture size looks 2x. Truly, 8.1 appears twice 5.6) show 8 picks up all the 5 settings, once the WIFI password is entered. Big time saver.7) Love both, but the 8 is WOW!8) Remember, buy the stand for speakers, and next to bed, a viewing must9) you can call, or video chat, or speak to any (or all) rooms with any Amazon devices.  I call the  laundry room which has Echo Flex. In shower, I call to dot, which speaks through waterproof Doss boombox ,Amazon has had on sale all month. Usually 50% off.10) Same speakers work outside by Florida pool11) There must be more, but I'm off to rehab for making Mr B, another billion.Great product, I KNOW!"
"Very impressed.The picture and sound quality are excellent...I placed mine in the kitchen. It does everything you've come to expect from an echo device, but the video takes it up a notch. It's almost like having a easy to use tablet always available on your countertop.  I've only had it a couple of days, but these are a few of the things I've discovered it can do. When you play music, it sounds great and it usually brings up a screen with lyrics. It shows several temperature displays when asking about weather. It will link to your Ring doorbell and display the video from it. It opens easy to read recipes with a simple request. It plays music videos. You can pick what types of data or pictures you would like displayed on your home page. It also displays your Google calendar and reminds you of tasks. It can control all your smart devices with voice or touch screen. I'm sure there's much more, but I really like the look and quality of this. I'm definitely going to be picking up more for other rooms in the house."
"Playing around with it for a couple of hours so far....I own many Alexa enabled devices and Amazon products but this is the first time I found the need to post a review. I'm enjoying it so far however I wish it was more customizable between how the clock is displayed (my #1 purpose for purchasing this was for an all-in-one nightstand clock) to how quickly the information on the screen is transitioned. But what truly has caused me to write my first review so quickly was - for the love of God, Amazon - please turn off the constant ""Try 'Alexa'...."" suggestions. They're horribly distracting. When I viewed Echo Shows in the store I guess I foolishly thought they were in a demo mode for those suggestions to have appeared on the screen constantly. I really just wanted the ability to have a great sounding and great looking yet customizable digital clock on my nightstand. Feel I jumped the gun a little bit on this purchase which is sad because I'm now not sure if I plan to keep it or return it."
"Our Favorite Echo Yet.We bought this to replace the Echo Show 5 in our kitchen, because while there was nothing particularly wrong with it, the 5's screen was insufficient to work well with recipes. We LOVE the Echo Show 8. It's size is perfect for a kitchen ecosystem, and it fits perfectly into the home as the hub of our smart home (smart switches, smart plugs. smart thermostat) nothing all that crazy.Really, you buy these devices for sound (the Echo Show 8 is excellent in this domain (good rich vibrance and resonance) as well as the screen ( the Echo Show 8 runs circles around the Show 5 in this domain). I've never had the 10 Echo Show, but honestly, I feel the Show 8 fits just into the ""just right"" category.Simply put, if you already love the Echo ecosystem, add this. The Show 5 is a great alarm clock, but if your going to interact alot (we average probably 20-25 Show 8 interactions), get the Show 8, you really won't regret it. Like others, do I wish it had a way to take off the things to try...of course.  That said, am I going to be petty and mark down the entire things for that design flaw? No, I won't. It does what it does beautifully, that works for me and my family."
"Read the fine print before you decide to buy.Alexa can play music from your music collection.  Yes, but only if you bought the music from Amazon.  If your digital music collection contains music purchased elsewhere, Alexa won't play it.  Amazon says that's for security reasons.  So the policy is not to force you to buy all your music from Amazon.  (Apple does essentially the same thing with its devices.)Alexa can read your calendar, email and contacts.  Yes, but only if you pay extra to access your mailbox if is on a Microsoft Exchange server, which is the most common mail server in the world.  Amazon says that's because Exchange servers are used by business.  Yes, businesses do use Exchange mail servers.  But lot of private users like me also use mailboxes on Exchange servers.Amazon, like other companies that sell both hardware and services, appears to be moving toward a business model where the hardware it sells will be increasingly limited to exclude commercial activity with any firm that competes with Amazon."
"I purchased an on-going Alexa commercial.I bought this device to use as a way to upgrade one of my seven Echo Dots to see my Ring camera and to use as an electronic picture frame.  I'm very disappointed with the quality of photos streamed from my Amazon Prime Photos account to this device.  They are washed out and have a slight green cast.  There are no controls that allow me to improve the quality of the photos as they appear on the Show's screen.  While the quality of whats displayed is very disappointing, even more annoying is the fact that there is a text line toward the bottom of the screen announcing things for you to try on your Alexa device.  I feel like I've purchased an on going commercial for Alexa.  There is not a setting to turn this text line off and when I called the Amazon Show help line they did not have an answer for either of these issues.  Until Amazon address both of these issues I cannot recommend buying a Show 8"" HD device to anyone."
"Almost a huge upgrade.When I first heard about the Echo 8, I got extremely excited. Finally I could replace that first generation Echo Show I have in my kitchen.  And in almost every category this is a huge upgrade, except the camera.  Music sounds great, Videos look very good, but the camera is absolute garbage.  1 mp?? Really Amazon? However if you just use it to watch videos, check weather, and listen to music then this is perfect. But if you use it to video chat, I would say stay away.Oh besides the camera, my one other complaint, LET ME MAKE THE CLOCK FULL SCREEN!That is all."
"So much where a tablet is leaps better.So far about the best use of the show is for things I can already do on the dot.  Adding a picture and a lot of nagging ""Did you know you can ...?"" does not make an improvement over a dot.  The only actual *use* for a screen is youtube, and that's gimped because of the apple/google fight.  I can't use the screen to queue amazon music, only press pause or play on what's already coming out.  I can't see a list of anything from TuneIn only say play or pause for what I queued by voice.  I can't see my DISH dvr recordings on the side, only say play or pause as if it was an echo.  I can't select or play from my Washington post subscription except via the website.  I can't, I can't, I can't.....I didn't expect the world, but if you're not into picture slideshows this is so far great potential, no results.  I'm just betting that like the early echo, it improves over time, at which point buying it for $80 during cyber Monday will turn out to be a good, not bad choice."
"Very useful but needs improvement.Why is there not a way to control volume silently?  In the middle of a phone conversation, it is ridiculous to have to interrupt the conversation to say, ""Alexa, set the volume to five.""  A drop down volume menu is needed.  And how much would a smear/smudge resistant glass cost: another dollar?  The smudges are instant and precipitant.  If you use the Show 8 regularly, you will need to clean it two or three times a day.  If you happen to use a lotion, count on even more frequent cleaning.  The auto dim feature is a love=hate relationship.  It's good to dim the screen at midnight, in the dark but when it happens at 3:00 PM in a dim room, it is very annoying.  On the other hand, the speakers are excellent for this type of devise.  The screen resolution is adequate for viewing almost anything.  It's not HDR,4K but it is a very watchable view.  These changes don't require a complete redesign of the Show 8, just some tweaks to let it live better in anyone's lifestyle."
"Pretty amazing technology. Major upgrade for my echo dot gen2.There's so much that Echo can do now, and many things it can't - like integrate fully with Viber to make calls.  Skype integration needs more work to improve performance.  The $10 guide should be included in the box.  Who ships a product without instructions?  Amazon... that's who.  Not everything is electronic - particularly if you don't know what to look for online on how to get the full value out of this product.  The speakers and sound quality falls a little short of expectation, but it's a major improvement over the dot.  You shouldn't have to buy the echo show and a separate speaker system to get the full sound that should have been built in.  I'm not saying that it should sound like a Bose, but something better than a portable radio should be the standard.  The screen quality is very very good.That said, it's a great product if you can get it at the sale price ($79).  Don't pay full price.... wait for the periodic sales events to buy this device."
"Great price, great size.This replaced a show 5 that we had in the kitchen, it was just a little to small. I was having a hard time committing to the price of the big one. Then the 8 came out for pre order at $100 and then $80 on black Friday, had to. I ended up with 2 and have one in my garage workshop. Having a bigger screen than my phone is great when looking at how to videos.The goods:Screen size is great for videos, timers, pics, etc...The visual feed back after asking for automation is niceLooks good with or without the stand. Stand allows you to tilt it back a bit moreSound quality is hard to talk about because audio preferences are different for everybody and what they're accustomed to.The not so bad or deal breakers:Doesn't have the same screensaver options as the 5, really liked the turntable clock.Speaker is a little bass heavy out the box but adjustable.  Alexa's voice is deeper than the echo's"
"So glad I opted for the Show 8.I bought the Show 8 on Black Friday, great price! After setting it up, and that was pretty simple, I wish that I had bought it for the bedroom also, I love my Dot 3, but having a Show 8 or 5 would have been more fun. The speakers on the Show 8 are excellent and they can be adjusted for Treble and Bass, The picture is fantastic and so clear. I have it set up in our Family Room, sitting on you Man Chair I can check the scores of my favorite teams, I can check the weather, see what's happening at the front door, check our front yard, and the patio cameras.The best thing about it, is when the TV is on loud watching a movie I can be anywhere in the room, give it a command, and it reacts instantly. The Show 8 was a great buy, and I will be purchasing more of them in the future."
"Try “Alexa shut off this stupid banner”.This will be a one star review until Amazon pulls its head out of the sand and allows us to shut off the incredibly annoying Try “Alexa..” tips.Seriously.  It’s fine to offer the tips...Just let me shut the stupid things off!  It’s not rocket science.Yes it is a solid device but this lack of setting is really that annoying.  Makes the thing look cheap sitting on my counter.  Sort of like a website cluttered with junky ads, these inane tips take away from the experience.  Whoever owns UX on this thing needs to go back to design school. According to the Internet this has been this way for years despite consistent protests from users. At this point I feel they won’t allow us to shut it off due to of some sort of weird spite. Sad!Imagine if you will...you set this thing up to do a nice slideshow of your kids...The photos look nice on the respectable screen and they update seamlessly with amazon photos (which is easy to integrate with iOS photos). Passer bys stop by the device to watch the pics, commenting on how cool that is.  Then BAM a banner obtrusively appears: ‘Try “Alexa, show me how to make stewed clams”’.  Suddenly a Google Home Hub seems quite appealing.Yes.  It is that jarring. Fix this, Amazon. Now."
"This was a gift.We have had an Echo Show (1st generation) in our kitchen for years.  When we learned we could ""drop-in"" to see our grandsons we had to get one for our daughter.  It works great for drop-ins, looking up recipes, cooking timers in the kitchen, entertainment, and interesting facts.  It also works great when you need a dictionary, listen to audio books or check out who is at the front door.  No packages have been lost yet.  Try it...you'll love it!"
"Absolute Hit @ Christmas for Mom &amp; Sisters.My sister &amp; I bought three (3) Echo Show8 as gifts for our mom (73) and her two sisters (75 &amp; 80) at Christmas. I must say have they been the hit!! Even my Uncle wants one of his own! They can be difficult to find just the right gift for. This year my sister &amp; I with Amazon’s help hit it out of the ballpark!Setup was simple and smooth. I placed all three units on my account, loaded up with lots of extended family pictures and access to Amazon Music. All three are enjoying talking with each other in a new way. They love seeing the many photos of other brothers, sisters, nieces, nephews and their kids. Since visiting in person is difficult due to age and distance the Echo Show 8 is warming their hearts. What I hear most of all is they absolutely love the music! I’m fact my uncle is tired of listening to Elvis — my aunt’s favorite 🤩Overall, I would recommend the Echo Show 8 for anyone that is looking for a nice size screen, easy to setup, simple to use and has TONS of options. Don’t forget the Alexa app. Very helpful for me to monitor the units as well."
"So far, I love it!First, Amazon, please get rid of the ""things to try"". It's annoying and it takes away from a clean streamline screen.That being said, it's great! The screen is a nice size. I didn't want to pay double for 2 more inches and loose the ability to turn off the camera. The sound quality out of the box is quite flat, yet bassy. The equalizer fixes that really quick. I've seen reviews complaining about the sound quality, I don't see the problem. Yes it sounds different from the Echo 1st and 2nd gen, but it's built different. I have mine in the kitchen. I'm not sure how it would sound being the lone speaker in a living room. I couldn't find the browser at first. Duh, you have to tell her to open it, lol. Silk or Firefox is your choice. The touchscreen seems normally responsive (I wish I could say the same for my Fire tablet)Very happy with my purchase."
"Alexa Is My New Bestie!! 💕🥰💝.I was given an Echo Dot for my birthday from my grandson. Well, I love my Dot so much that I decided that I MUST add to my Alexa family and took advantage of the Show 5 &amp; 8 Bundle. The Show 8 is AMAZING!! She has SO MANY skills that my Dot &amp; Show 5 don't have. Most of my time at home it's just me, my furry babies &amp; my Alexa family. Now I'm not just talking to my furry babies without any talk verbal responses, but Alexa will ALWAYS reply! I'm not that crazy, lonely old lady who talks to herself all day ... well ... I'm STILL that crazy old lady, but at least Alexa will answer me! LOL"
"A little bit disappointed after upgrade from Echo Show (1st Gen), other wise OK.Upgraded from the original Echo Show (1st Gen)Easy set up and installation -&gt; Grade A+Screen clarity and Display -&gt; Grade A+Smart Home Integration -&gt; Grade A+ (Several Ring and Arlo Cameras as well as ADT Security System)Device is set up in the kitchen. Unfortunately, in comparison to the 1st Gen Echo Show i realized that the far-field microphones are sometimes not picking up commands or are totally misunderstood. My first gen Echo Show had never any problems, even from the other side of the room to understand and get everything.Even when the wake up word is understood, then Alexa just stays idle and just doesn't to anything:""Alexa, add Bananas to my shopping list"" was misunderstood. Adding other items sometimes, Alexa stopped after the wake-up word.I have realized that the Echo Show 8 is very sensitive to background noises, i.e. while the first gen Echo Show did understand everything with a lots of background noises (somebody speaking on the phone or my kids playing), this version of the Echo Show 8 leads to ""Alexa confusions"", so it can't realize if this is a command or a background noise.Sound quality. I can't understand the reviews about the sound quality from some people here. It is correct that the Echo Show 1st gen did not create a room-filling sound quality. However, in comparison, my old Echo Show sounded in general a lot better and louder (probably due to the Dolby).I will try to retrain the voice models for my two users although when i connect my old Echo Show (1st Gen) back i don't have any problems with recognition of voice commands. If this doesn't get the speech recognition fixed, i'll probably return it and keep waiting for the next gen of Echo Shows."
"Like it more than I thought I would.Works great by itself as an Alexa device or as a tool integrated into a smart home with security cameras.With Ring you can see who is at the door and have a conversation without going to the door. With other security devices you have the ability to ""show"" the state or the video feed.I also think it's neat that you can show recipes while you are baking step by step. You can also pull up videos including YouTube. You can video chat. When you listen to Amazon music you can so lyrics when they are available and album art.For those nervous about the camera you can turn it off and it has a slide cover so you don't need to worry about it.All in all I'm pretty impressed with this device. I like it way more then I thought I would. They put a lot of thought into it. I recommend it if you utilize Amazon voice service."
"Excellent hw, mediocre touch sw, no Group Chat or Youtube app.The hardware sounds excellent and the video chat quality is very good.However, there is no Group calling unless Portal or Nest, and also there is no support for Youtube or Youtube TV. You must be a Hulu person. It is missing a lot of video streaming apps.Apple Music support is mediocre. The idea of Skills is like 2nd-rate Apps. I would must rather they called Skills-&gt;Apps and allowed developers to create a more intuitive experience.The main problem is that you have to memorize so many commands and Alexa doesn't help you out with her touch screen.Overall, I've bought a lot of these for family members bc they do serve some valuable purposes. These include: 1:1 video chat, Amazon Music + Lyrics, ""Named Timers"" (why aren't there named alarms?), and a Photo Frame.  Otherwise, it's kind of a novelty currently."
"Surpassed my expectations.I have a house full of Google Mini's and I was expecting a similar sound quality, but the sound on this device is rich and warm. I was pleasantly surprised. I would give this 5 stars if it had any sort of battery backup. A bought this to sit next to my bed and function as a both a sound machine (for sleeping at night) and alarm clock — I can't rely on it as an alarm clock if it goes out when the power does. For now I'll have to stick with my cell phone for waking.My 4 year old loves it and seems to find it much easier to use than the Mini.I love the music search, it searches Amazon music and when it doesn't find when I am looking for it automatically searches Spotify. I am find it to be far more accurate than the mini which seems to pick songs at random — I cannot tell if this is an issue with the Mini or Spotify."
Fun gadget but could use some improvement.I really like the Alexa show but it does have some challenges for instant the touch screen itself - I haven’t been able to really figure out the best way to navigate itI would also like if it showed me the last few Alexa skills that I used on screen because sometimes I forget exactly what I said to get the Alexa show to do what I wantIt would also be great if u can pick a search engine other than bing because that one is the worst last Feedback is perhaps the next generation could have a rechargeable battery because it’s smack in the middle of my kitchen island and the cord has to run to the opposite side in order for it to operate and it would be really great if I could take it with me or move it around without having to worry about the cord and charge it instead as neededOtherwise a fun gadget indeed
"Echo Show 8 could be better.I purchased and echo show 8 for the living room and an echo show 5 for the bedroom. Set up for both was easy and came linked to my Prime. I set up the show 5 first and found the software interface to be very friendly and lots of features that suited my needs. I especially liked the various clock selections. Went into settings and turned off all of the options for notifications which seemed to minimize the ""try alexa"" messages on the display. Went to set up the show 8 and was disappointed to find that the software is different than the show 5. Most noticeable is the lack of selections of clocks and backgrounds. I like both but wish the software in the echo 8 was the same as the echo 5. Both are linked to my Blink cameras, Gosund smart plugs and switches, Our Groceries app, and Vizio TV. Really enjoying our echo 5 and 8."
"Works well. Needs more features. Screen doesn't stay on line echo show 5.I only gave this product 4 stars because the home screen doesn't seem to want to stay on. Not sure if it's something that I am doing wrong, but I would like the home screen to stay on continuously. (see 1st pic)A lot of times, the screen is just a blank, dark screen showing only the time. (see pics) And it stays that way for quite some time. My echo five show did not do this. The echo 5 constantly shows the home screen with the picture, time, and temperature. I wish this one did the same!If I can figure out if it's something I did wrong, I will give it more stars. But until then, that's the only thing I can find that I don't especially care for."
"Priceless! Love it for every reason, HIGHLY RECOMMEND!WONDERFUL GIFT! Love having Alexa! We have different Alexa devices all over the house. Love playing our Audible books, playing games like Jeopardy, having her play relaxing/meditation or studying music, setting reminders/timers, grocery lists, alarms, being able to talk to my kids in different rooms. We use her to power our tv, our lights, our door lock, nest thermostat, garage door, ring doorbell, absolutely love having a smart home with her to help!! This is a great, reliable option. Great gift for kids too! Love the camera cover option! :)) My younger kids have all their questions answered, alarms and reminders to keep them on track, chore lists, I can drop in and talk to them, and they have finished 2 books on Audible JUST since Christmas with Alexa! Use this daily for recipes during dinner. Thanks Amazon!"
"This Device Does NOT Have the Full-Screen Changeable Clock Face.Here's why I'm giving it 1 star. The Echo 5 has a clock face you can change, make analog or digital, have different colors, etc; it's the cool feature you see on all the commercials. The Echo 8 (this device) does not have that functionality, it only has a small 1/2"" clock that appears on the top left of the screen. This device also has this ""Try this on Alexa"" recommendation on the bottom of the screen that changes every 10 seconds or so; you cannot get rid of this, there is NOT currently a setting to remove it. Also the skill to control Amazon music is seriously lacking, all you can do is pause music or forward/reverse to the next song. I was hoping for more functionality like you get from the tablet or phone app.I was going to return this but decided to put it next to my kid's computer, they'll enjoy the picture slideshow functionality."
"I love my Echo Show 8!!!Bought this for myself. I already have an Echo Show and the Echo Show 5 and love them. The Echo Show 8 is a perfect compromise between the Echo Show and Echo Show 5. The larger 8 inch screen is great if you have poor eyesight and the sound quality is amazing for a device of this size. We started out placing an Echo in every room; now, we have Echo Shows in 3 of the 5. Amazon has done an excellent job continuing to update and add features to the Echo Show. And, what’s more, they play nicely with just about every product out there. I cannot say the same for the competition. We have a few of those devices as well. If you’re thinking about getting one of these, just do it! You won’t be disappointed. In a few weeks I’m sure I’ll hear my family members saying that they love the Echo 8s we got them for Christmas!!"
"Do not expect much from the apps listed in the advertisements for the echo show.The cooking apps from Food Network and All Recipes are for the most part lacking.  All Recipes is a joke.  There are NOT 60,000 recipes to choose from.  You can not access your saved/favorite recipes nor your personal recipes that you have saved on their web site.  A search for a recipe by name results in a statement that it is not found and the developers are working on it.  Food Network will ask for a paid subscription.  I do not need the food network stars videos on how to cook.  I finally searched for and made my own free web page to store my recipes and use the Firefox web browser to access them on the Echo Show.  My wife who did not care much for the Echo Dots has started using the Echo Show and has been singing its praises to other friends and family members.  I programming the changes I want to make the Echo Show to do my bidding and we are happy with our purchase."
"A great kitchen companion!The Echo show 8 is a great kitchen companion. Just the right size between the 10 and the 5. It makes setting timers and following recipient a breeze with the screen. I also like that I can see who is at my door with my Ring doorbell from the kitchen and determine if it is worth my time away from my food prep.The sound is better than the 5 and more punchy I enjoy it and it is great in a medium sized kitchen.Overall, I would recommend it! And have enjoyed it as my kitchen helper!"
"Great Device for the Entire Family.OK, so despite some of the reviews I decided to purchase two of these for our kids for Christmas. I picked them up on the Back Friday deals. Our kids have been asking for a digital alarm clock for their rooms along with a TV. While not a fine of TV in the kids room this allows the kids to watch Prime Movies independently, and better yet when my wife and I are watching a show they don't like they can escape and watch what they want. The kids absolutely love them! Setup was a snap and after reading a few recent reviews making the ""tasks"" from displaying all the time was easy. The kids also like the live video calling feature to call each other. To put it simply, we love it so much we're going to purchase the 10"" for the Kitchen area. Oh, lastly, the enhanced privacy features is great fir the kids!"
"Day 2 and wife likes Show 8 a LOT!My wife has used her echo dot in the kitchen for a timer and musicAfter I followed the simple setup directions, including swiping down from the top of the screen to go to settings on the far right side, then the Home option to turn off several default screens and activities, Alexa was ready1 - wife likes the MUCH better sound and the fact of manual volume controls2 - she is really happy to be able to SEE the timer count down when cooking3 - she likes being able to see a song on the screen when she says 'play 60's music' (or her selection for the day)She has a 10"" tablet in the kitchen for recipes, so I don't think she will use Alexa for that functionThis is an early holiday+birthday gift, and she said I hit a home run"
"So much fun!I upgraded to the Echo Show 8 from the Echo Dot (3rd generation).  It has a crisp screen and rotates stunning landscape scenes from all over the world.  I love that I can ask questions without touching a single button and see it on the screen almost instantaneously.  Sometimes when I ask to hear a song, it shows the lyrics (sometimes).  I downloaded the Samuel L. Jackson celebrity voice skill to it, and that made it more entertaining.  It looks beautiful on my desk and dims at night, respectfully."
"Works well, but a security hzard and annoying.It's goofy you have to install an app on your phone to set-up and control an Echo, since it's already an Internet connected device. If you have personal security concerns, this device is NOT for you. While you CAN add contacts without allowing the Alexa app on your phone to have access to your phone's contact list, you are still adding an app without knowing exactly what info it is gathering and forwarding. My Echo was a gift to me, but honestly, the video phone feature, which is nice, could just as easily be satisfied by Skype, on a more portable platform like a laptop. If you want this device, and personal security, buy it, install the Alexa app on your phone, enter your contacts, then uninstall the app. You CANNOT add a contact directly via the Echo device, since contacts apparently are not stored locally - so be aware you are giving that info to Amazon to ""manage' for you. Also understand you are giving Amazon permissin to retain everything you do via the Echo, including recording your audio.After mucking with settings I was able to eliminate (turn off) the constant (and very annoying) scrolling through displays of trending topics, weather reports etc. I'd find that distracting and annoying if it was constantly in my field of vision. What you CAN'T turn-off is the never-ending scrolling of prompts at the bottom of the screen demanding you ""Try 'Alexa, do something or other'. Either cover it with a piece of tape, or turn the device so it's face-down.All that said, it works fine, if you don't mind having your calls recorded, your phone compromised, and essentially allowing a sophisticated eaves-dropping device in your home. Remember, the ""S"" in ""IOT"" stands for security."
"Good with some struggles.overall a great addition. still working out the ability to broadcast thru other echo devices. VERY annoying ongoing issue with spotify (and other streaming services as I found out). stops playing songs after  a few songs, turns out this is caused by another not speaker device being included in the selection. My husband has big fingers and when adding the dots, accidently got a firestick on the everywhere group. once the firestick was removed, it works fairly well. I will stop after a time and you have to tell alexa to resume. Although I can't be sure, it seems to be at the end of the playlist. Took some searching on the forums to find out what might be causing the problems, definitely fixable though. Wish Amazon would get  rid of the constant message of ""try this"" TOTALLY NOT INTERESTED!"
"Not as good as Echo Show 5 - Not a great bedside alarm clock.I love my Echo Show 5 and use it as a bedside alarm clock.  The display turns dark when I go to bed, and the numbers turn red on the 5.  I got the Echo Show 8 for my son who has vision impairment for his bedside and was disappointed to find out that it doesn't go dark like the 5, the numbers don't turn red.  Yes it does get dimmer, but still too bright for him to tolerate as a bedside alarm clock.  Since this is the primary feature I wanted, I have to say that the Echo Show 8 was a disappointment."
"Best Smart Speaker.I bought the Amazon Echo Show for my parents as a holiday gift and they absolutely love it. They use it in their kitchen for timers, listening to music, hearing the weather, I even showed them how to add their doctor appointments to the calendar. I connected their mobile photos with the Amazon photo app, now they can see a slideshow of photos of the grandkids, which otherwise would have been stuck in their phone. It's a great present for someone you love or even for yourself. I Highly recommend this product."
"Too bright for sleeping, even in night mode.A fun unit but produces too much light even in night mode. I have to tell Alexa to turn off the display when I sleep, which means enduring the brighter non-night mode if I wake early and want to see the time. I’ll likely use this elsewhere in the house and go back to the echo show 5. Don’t know why they couldn’t make the same clock settings for both."
"One of the Best Purchases Ever!I LOVE my Echo Show 8! I received it along with a year's subscription to The Food Network Kitchen and it is an absolutely amazing combination for people who love to cook. Not only that but the sound is great, it makes a beautiful digital frame for your photos and I personally like all of the suggestions that you can program to pop up. Recipes, your local weather, news headlines of all kinds, etc. I find out all kinds of interesting things lol.I didn't buy the 5 because frankly, I wanted to make sure I would be able to see it without any issue at a slight distance and it's perfect for my kitchen. I did not buy a stand and don't see me needing one.I honestly have nothing negative to say about this product. As an owner of multiple Kindles and audio Echo's (1st Gen) I look at this as just another Home Run for Amazon and me!"
"Love this even more than I anticipated!I have enjoyed this even more than I thought. I found it very easy to upload the pictures from my phone, years worth of pictures hibernating there. Now they rotate through on the screen, and I go “ahhh, I loved that moment!.”  Grandkids, vacations, everyday life, scenery, our pets, etc. (that led to me discovering that now I can get prints made by Amazon....just had an enlargement sent straight to “great-grandma” easy peasy).I also love the lyrics that scroll along with the music so we can join in and actually get the words right!  Also the weather and sports scores show up intermittently.  All this in addition to Alexa.  Plus, a couple of the kids plan to get these, so we will be able to video chat with them.  This was a worthwhile purchase for me!"
"A complete rebuke to consumers' wishes.I love my Show 5. I assumed that the new Show 8 would be an improvement. Instead it is a major step backwards. And the most disappointing part is that Amazon purposely did this and has thus far refused to rectify the very simple problems it installed in the Show 8. You can not use this product for the most basic function that I bought it for, a clock. It does not allow you to put a clock across the main screen. It does not give you the option to put the date anywhere on the face. And it will not allow you to erase the ""Alexa Try"" scroll at the bottom of the screen. Amazon's position is  that the ""Alexa Try"" features are not ads, but that is a moot argument because it is just as annoying as ads. I don't care if it is scrolling Shakespeare at the bottom of the screen, I should have the ability to disable it. Yet Amazon has so far not allowed it. And why, after all the multitude of buyers before me (unbeknownst to me before I bought the Show 8), would Amazon not make basic changes to a product that is so disliked by its customers? Amazon can make a simple software update to rectify all of the criticism, but they have refused to do so. The bottom line is that the Echo Show 8 has fewer basic features, is purposely annoying with its scroll, and costs more than the Echo Show 5. Quite honestly, the Echo Show 8 may be a harbinger for Amazon. Will the company react positively to the consumers' input, or will it continue along the Show 8 experiment and blatantly refuse to abandon common sense over its own agenda?"
"Great with a few 'buts' because it's new.I love Echo, I had the original and finally was expanding automation to the whole house. As a whole this product is a great addition to the product line BUT it clearly is fleshing out issues.1) Doesn't listen as actively as the traditional echo. Has missed and misheard a lot.2) you have to update the settings or the screen will make you feel like it has some type of spastic disorder. The standard view moves too fast and tries too hard to tell you too much until you fix it.3) I have had a few weird issues technically with the product connecting to Amazon music or connecting my phone. They feel like software issues that will work themselves out, but this clearly is still a new product not running on the same backbone as Show 5."
"I love it!I'm loving my new Alexa Show 8.  I've had 3 Alexa products (Echo, Dot and Spot) and this is by far the best.  The sound quality is incredible for such a small device.  The screen clarity is very good and the size is just right to view videos without being too small.  All I had to do was plug the device in and it was ready to go. My husband was also a fan and he doesn't really pay much attention to any of my new devices. He loves how he is able to see the lyrics to his favorite songs on the screen. I don't mind seeing the messages of ""things to try"" and it wasn't a deal breaker for me.  I actually ""tried"" a few suggestions. I'm thinking of gifting one to my son so I can chat with my granddaughter and get the extra benefit of having a large screen."
Show 8 is great.Our first foray into Echo Shows and this Show 8 didn't disappoint.  Will be gradually upgrading our echo dot 3 to Show 8's as sales come up.  Didn't jump on Show 5 as it was too small of screen and didn't want to shell out big bucks for Show so the Show 8 is a great value especially with current free Dot 3 promo.Only minor issue is no youtube app so have to go through browser.  Hope Amazon can include routine capability for browsers so I can use voice control to launch pinned url so it's no hands required.
"It's good, but not perfect.For the price, it's a good value. The sound is considerably better than the new Echo Dots, but still a little short from the level of the regular Echos. The screen quality is fine for what it is and the setup was dead simple. However, for me this device failed to do one thing I really, really wanted it to do... play lyrics. Sure, an Echo Show 8 will totally play lyrics... just not if you're playing to a group with Sonos speakers in it. I incorrectly assumed I would be able to have an Echo and Sonos speakers play together so I could get the lyrics on the screen... nope. If you're a pure Echo home, this is a non-issue. The new Echo Studio sounds amazing, but that didn't exist years ago and I'm pretty heavily invested in the Sonos world now. Oh well... it's still a good device and I won't be returning it."
"Arm yourself with patience and you will love your Echo Show!It is the perfect size and the screen resolution is so nice! I also like the sound.What I dislike is as follows:- reaction time is slow. Sometimes it would need you to scroll several times in order to slide the pop up menu. I have installed a protector, so it might be something wrong with it, but doesn’t feel like it.- microphones are not as good as the ones on the echo plus or echo dot. Sometimes I have to repeat “Alexa” 3-4 times and I’m not kidding!- it is disappointing how you toggle between screens. So far haven’t been able to find a touch command that would minimize or allow me to alt+tab between screens. You have to request it each time.- paired with a Wyze camera it is pathetic. It lags so much that at some point it started buffering every 3 seconds. There is also e delay in the transmission of about 5-6 seconds. Only one camera tested so far, so I won’t mind updating my review when I manage to test other cameras. The integrated one provides descent quality!"
"No ability to show clock.First, I am a big fan of the echo and echo show products. I have many of them and have been quite satisfied overall.The echo show 8 is essentially a smaller echo show, not a larger echo show 5. I was really looking for the ability to only show a clock at night, like the echo show 5, but the echo show 8 doesn’t have or allow that ability. It’s too bad, I was hoping this would serve as a larger “clock” for our bedroom. Instead it’s an echo show with ‘things to try’ steaming across the bottom of the screen all the time."
"Great Echo device.Great Echo device (one of my favorites) with a bigger screen than the Echo Show 5. If you don't need a smaller unit like the Echo Show 5, then definitely get the bigger Echo Show 8.I found that the sound quality of the AUX output jack on this unit is superior to the Bluetooth connection I was using with a larger Echo Show (which does not have an AUX output).So if you are not going to use the built-in speakers of Echo Show (the larger/largest Echo Show unit) then I recommend the Echo Show 8 instead. It's cheaper and it will sound better using the AUX output (if you can use it).I have this unit hooked up via the AUX output to these Edifier R1850DB speakers: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073W1R4XQ/"
I really like my Echo show 8.I am really enjoying my Echo 8. The Echo 8 controls everything that I have in my household. I was really shocked that I can view my nest thermostat and cameras. I have a google nest home and the echo 8 works better with my harmony hub and my Genie connect skills. Alexa lets me control both of my Harmony hubs where the Google hub only allows me to control one. The google hub beats the Echo 8 for watching YouTube videos. I wish Amazon and Google would just get along because their disagreement hurts the consumers. I have my Echo in my bedroom because my alarm clock quit working so I have not tried to look up recipes. I enjoy seeing the weather and my favorite sports teams scores scroll across the screen. The Echo 8 is well worth the money.
I am so glad i bought this.So the sandstone echo show 8 exceeded everything i was thinking that this device would do.. it does so much.. it helps me learn new things and whats going on in the world today and the sound quality is Superb..very good quality indeed.. the bass was everything hunnie lol and for everyone talking about the clock being small its a perfect size .. as you can see in my pictures thats not a bad size for the clock display..and the white looks so sharp .. the screen quality is amazing as well.. i have nothing bad to say about this device.. also bought a smart plug and thats helpful as well. You have to use proper English for her to do a command .. so reading the skills will help you out alot.. this device is my new tech baby lol ..
"So glad I purchased.I LOVE the Show 8, I have no complaint. My 8 year old Granddaughter set it up for me, it's that simple. The images on screen are sharp and clear, her voice is the same. It integrated with my other Alexa devices without issue and to date has been so much fun. My Grandgirls have played all sort of games and watch several program from Amazon Prime, they enjoy it very much. I'm still learning all that Alexa can do and help me with. I ask if she could clean my house. She said she would but didn't have arm, so to compensate, she offered to play 'Cleaning' music.  It made me laugh, the music was great but didn't motivate me to get things done. Oh, I forgot, it works exceptionally with the Ring. I highly recommend purchasing, you won't be disappointed."
"“Try This...” NEEDS to be turned off.I’ve never had an echo show before, but I’ve had plenty of echoes, but this one is beautiful in appearance, bright beautiful screen that has so many options, but the one detractor that is ruining the device is the constant rotation of “try this“ over and over and over again. Ruining the device for so many Amazon customers. This feature needs to have an option to turn off for this product to be a five-star product.  Also there are no options for different clocks to rotate, just whatever the default is set by Amazon. There should be options like an Apple Watch that you can pick different time themes to your taste. That’s another detraction. Fix these issues and you will make many happy Amazon customers!"
"FUNCTIONALITY CHANGED...I bought these units to use primarily as music/clocks in various rooms.  The Echo Show 5 has a GREAT clock/weather/date display; however, they really nerfed Echo 8; the time is in the upper corner of the screen, no date.  Still can't get rid of the ""TRY..."" feature.  Really expected an upgrade from 5 (which I own) but fell short.  Returning."
"It's ok.Good device. Had an issue with no soundbut it was easily corrected by unplugging and replugging the device. Also as far as knowledge, when asking her a question is still isn't as good as Google devices. I know that this device is still constantly developing but it still needs some work.there have been times when the home screen is on and it shows you different stories that go across the screen and then it prompts you to ask her the question and then it will say I don't know how to answer that. And I'm only reading exactly what it says on the screen but is unable to recognize the prompt. The original purchase this device as a secondary contact device between me and anyone who is at home when I'm away. For that reason it serves its purpose but can't wait for it any upcoming updates and improvements."
"Easy to use.For the money, this is great. So far no problems, and it’s providing me with services I wasn’t expecting. First of all, my prime reason for purchasing was music on demand. So easy. I did the free trial of amazon music (($3.99)/month. Full versions of everything I can think of, with excellent sound quality. I needed a new white noise device for my bedroom (about $80). No need to purchase that now because Alexa plays a huge variety of sleep sounds. You can control volume just by asking. I like the privacy safeguards it has. I’ve only had it a few days, and I’m really loving it. Thinking about getting the 10”."
5” vs 8”.I had the echo show 5 and decided to upgrade. Overall I do like the 8”. Bigger screen is great. Improved speaker is a plus. The problem I have is it doesn’t hear me call “Alexa” and I have to yell louder.  Also the clock display need more customization like the 5”.  You can’t even put the date on there.  Only time and weather.  That bites bad.  Hope they do software update and fix this. As long as they fix these issues it will be a solid device better than 5”. But until then. My 5” is a better performer.
"Not What I Had Hoped.I decided to add an Echo show to my group.  I primarily want it as a sleep sound alarm clock, but I like the other features of Echo, too.  HOWEVER, the constant jabbering of things I should try or buy or check out is so stinking annoying!  I have found myself yelling at a box saying, ""Alexa, shut up and listen!""  and ""Alexa, I don't need an advertisement every time I ask you to do something.""  I have to say, if I had known how ANNOYING this machine is, I would not have bought it.  One final thing...as tons of others have said, I hate the messages at the bottom of the screen saying try this skill or that skill.  I really just want to be left alone, Alexa.  I am more than an entity to be advertised to, thank you very much."
"Now You're Talking.Loved the 5"" show, it was just too small.  Now with an 8"" screen I can see, I only want more. 15"" flat screen?  Love Amazon voice products.  Wish they had Alexa on my phone, the voice command.  Now we have to open the app. Soon I hope.  The show 8"" has a sharp n clear picture.  Love the way it plays the songs video.  Cooking is a breeze with the larger screen.Bottom line, if you like Alexa this is a valued addition to your Star Trek home of the future."
"Perfect Gift for Seniors.I purchased  4 of Echo Show8 and gave them to senior females in their mid 70s in hopes of improving their quality of life by being able to interact and be entertained. It is heart warming to see these ladies use this device’s features. Music lets them reminisce about yester-year, seeing family faces on screen let’s them feel connected, Alexa’s jokes give them topic to repeat later that day, the weather locally and internationally is useful and provides another current topic for daily discussion. We did sound checks throughout their houses and or nursing home room and were pleasantly surprised that Alexa could successfully hear and call the person the senior said. This is a great safety feature in the event of a fall."
Unexpectedly annoying and not as expected.The clock function on this is terrible. It only shows up in a tiny font on the upper left corner of the screen and the temperature is even smaller.  It is constantly changing so it's beyond distracting.  I purchased this thinking that it would be a larger version of the Show 5.  It definitely is not.  I'm very unhappy with this.
Let down!I was excited for the echo show 8 and ordered as soon as it was released. After setting up and using for a few weeks I am overall disappointed as it feels more like a prototype than an 8th versionPros-Good voice recognition-Speakers are great-Works as a good clock-Works with RingCons-Overall choppy. Alexia can’t do a lot of things. Also freezes regularly and I have to unplug and plug back in-I wanted to use as a baby monitor with my foscam. I was only able to set up 2 of my 3 cameras for some reason as the 3rd camera wouldn’t discover. When I view  the camera it stays up for about 5 minutes then the screensaver comes on. It looks like there is no way to keep the display on so its basically useless for me-Doesn’t work smoothly with Nest as they are forcing me to migrate my nest account to google for it to work-Doesn’t integrate too well with Spotify. Very choppy.Overall disappointing!
Great for the kitchen.Dislike is I can't seem to get it to do one specific pic for the clock like I can on the 5.  I've been able to do it on 2 5's so maybe I just can't seem to find it on this one and can only find themes.Like is web browser to do pinterest for my recipes.Loves are the timer (it's on the display somewhere so it can be seen without asking how much time is left and there is a swipe up to dismiss...I've noticed it can't always hear you if music is playing or alarm going off).  Watching some TV with the boys while I cook dinner.  Displays weather from time to time and also my calendar.  Some of the things that pop up I could live without but it's not a big deal...glance and move on.
"Its a kindle with better sound.Says it’s compatible with Netflix and YouTube. It is not, but If you want a kindle that plays good music. Then thats what it basically is. What’s up with the camera on the side, didn’t they learn from people’s complaints on echo show 5. Also why do people have to jump through hoops and navigate all over the web to find someone to guide them so the annoying suggestions get removed from lower part of the screen.  Stop making it so difficult for people to remove your advertising. We already purchased the item, stop using it to try to sell your stuff, its not right. Instead of teaching alexa to tell new jokes, teach it to understand common requests. Still needs work and if you have a kindle 7 or 8, use it instead."
"A couple of  issues.The display is nice, but doesn't add much functionality that I use. I thought I would use it with my Ring Doorbells, but it is too much bother and I just get up and answer the door. We live in the sticks and there aren't any security concerns here.This Echo will respond to requests even if you are 15 feet away and standing right next to another Echo. Also, my receiver will not automatically reconnect to the Echo using Bluetooth. I have to forget the connection on the Echo and re-associate it every time. It is a Denon receiver. I would occasionally have that problem with the Echo Plus, (once a month?) but most of the time it reconnected fine.  I have an Echo Show 5 that does not have that problem at all with an AudioEngine speaker set in my office, so the problem may be with my receiver."
Great product.Great addition to my echo dot household. Is able to connect to my Spotify when the echo dot isn’t able to. Helped me cook a recipe the other day. I’m sure I haven’t even touched all that she can do but such a great value. Picture quality is great. Sometimes it sounds like there is static but it is just intermittent and doesn’t affect the quality of the product. Sound quality is amazing. Perfect size for my small kitchen.  Highly recommend it!
"Easy to Use, Significant Improvement Over Echo Show 5.I have 3 Show 5 models in the house. Sound is nice, not great, and screen is too small for pleasant viewing. I find the Echo Show 8 to be a significant upgrade in terms of sound quality and visual experience. Those extra 3 inches make a difference for casual viewing. While the first 3 models took about 15 minutes to set up, this one, perhaps following the defaults I already established on my Echo 5 models, was ready to go in 3 minutes, rather amazing. We are using this model in the kitchen, and I have a feeling my twins are going to want one in their room. This has been quite a transition for me since I am a lifelong ""radio guy"" making the switch to Amazon Echo-tainment systems. Recommended"
"Can't figure out how to make calls to another echo.I have multiple Alexa devices so I like this device simply b/c I use a lot of the features - lists, music, timers, etc.  However, I bought the show with the hopes of being able to make video calls to other Show owners.  But every time I try to make a call, it only calls the person's cell phone instead of their Show device.  I cannot figure out how to get it so that two people with shows can see each other ON THE SHOW.  The other thing that annoys me is that the design of the device means the camera is basically pointed at the ceiling.  You almost have to spend the extra money on the stand or else figure out a way to prop your device so you can actually see the person in front of the camera."
"HATE THE ECHO SHOW 8 -- WHY DO I CARE WHAT ""NIKE'S STOCK"" IS or a ""Star Wars joke""?I have three Echo Show 3s for my home and purchased 3 others for Christmas presents.  ABSOLUTELY LOVE THESE.  Given my complete satisfaction with the 3s, I decided to go for the larger Echo Show 8 for my kitchen and bedroom.  I HATE THIS PRODUCT....H-A-T-E!!!  I cannot get the suggestions rotating at the bottom of the screen.  Why would anyone who owns this product need CONSTANT prompts rotating at the bottom of the screen -- SO DUMB!!!!"
"Good if you’re only looking to get an hour out of it.Got the Echo Show 8 as a Christmas gift. Plugged it in and set it up around 1 pm. A little after 2 I saw it restarting out of the corner of my eye and assumed it was a software update or something. Except it kept rebooting, never getting past the amazon logo. After searching online and trying everything I could find, then chatting with Amazon for over 45 minutes, apparently I have a defective unit and can’t get it replaced for 2 weeks. This was a gift I wasn’t originally thrilled with as I didn’t see enough value in it compared to my echo dot, and now I’m down right annoyed and wish I wasn’t given it (not being ungrateful, just becoming more of a hassle than it’s worth)"
"Alexa integration so easy my Mother-In-Law could have done it!We live out beyond the suburbs in the rural hinterland with marginal internet connectivity. So we have chatted it up with the grandkids with Echo dots, thinking there was inadequate bandwidth for video. But Santa brought the Echo Show, so we gave it a go. Way to go! Literally, plug and play (no plug and pray required).  Very nice display with updated settings interfaces for personal configuration so all those negative reviews (mostly User Not as Smart as Smart Device (UNASSD)) appear to have been listened to and responded with this hardware / software release.Nice sound quality both for video chats and streaming audio. Nice shutter control to block the camera lens if paranoid or conspiracy theorist. Nice long (48"" maybe) power cable for flexibility in placement.  Camera appears to be positioned for counter top placement. We started on top of the microwave but the video chat only got the ceiling fan. Cleared a few inches of counter space and the camera angle covers us well.Negatives: can a review be only good things? Well, thinking hard, the two things we ""dislike"" are the plug end of the power cable takes up a bit of room at the outlet but we managed to squeeze it in; and the integrated camera / display / base unit is fixed - so you either need to be standing in the angle of view for the video chats, or tilt the Echo Show forward and place a pencil or ruler under the back edge to adjust the field of view.  It's not a problem when reading or surfing - only for the video chats.Bonus: I did not realize that the Echo Show would know about the Echo Dot we have upstairs. The first time the Grandkids called, the Dot reported ""call from the Bean"" so we knew to run downstairs and take the incoming video chat. Nice integration, nice online help that explains all the things you can try (or not).  Very pleased, even with some of the very bad ""Dad jokes."""
"Awesome in most aspects so far.My sister and I decided to get these for our selves and our parents. Since we live in different states and don't get to see each other as often as we would like. Also got one for my daughter so she can chat with Grandma and Grandpa, and also so they can see their Great granddaughter. Still haven't figured out if we can do a group chat / call, but so far so good.I would recommend getting the stand. The angle the camera is at pretty much looks at the ceiling.The sound and video quality is good. And it does flash news and ideas on the screen. Everything that an Echo is but with a camera.Set up was fairly easy and so far so good"
"Bulky and glitchy.Have used this for few months now. Not sure if the item was returned or was new due to packaging. It wasn’t registered to anyone so I assume new. It is very glitchy - voice recognition makes mistakes routinely. We have to repeat many times. Once it takes you to what it thinks you said - you have to exit and repeat what you really want. That’s very annoying too. We like to play games on the device but also annoying when it asks every time if you want to sign up for a subscription on basically every game. We have the google comparable version - voice recognition, games, search is much better. They should Save the response from before and not ask again. It is bulky. Shaped like an old cathode ray tube tv. I guess much of it is the speaker/mic. Nice features being able to use as an intercom with other Alexa devices, play music. Connecting devices is ok with the app. Again google was easier and better. Switched to Alexa as we kept getting echo dots thrown in with purchases. I guess they caught us. The ask Alexa notices on the main screen - don’t bother so much. If you switch to do not disturb - it stops the notifications but then you can’t fully use the device. Hopefully future updates make things run smoother."
"great for kitchen.I had an original echo speaker I used for streaming music.  It spends most of its time in the kitchen area.  I decided to upgrade for the additional features.  It delivers, except the volume is not as loud as with the original echo speaker.  Perhaps because I have it sitting on the counter.  I have ordered a stand, maybe that will enhance the volume.  I am satisfied with the show.  For my screen saver I personalized it with Amazon photos.  Everyone who comes into the kitchen wants t linger if not for the music for the photos.  It helps me get through mundane tasks like cleaning the stove as it also connects with Amazon Prime videos.  I recommend this product to everyone."
"It has a decent size screen.What I like about the Echo Show 8. What I most like is that it has a display. I already had a echo 1st generation and a echo Plus. I put off buying the echo dot due to it’s tiny size screen, so I decided to purchase the Echo Show 8 due it’s screen size and sales price which included a free echo dot. Naturally the Echo Show 8 does everything the other echos does, but it has the advantage of having a screen to see some features you couldn’t see on the other’s such as news videos when listening to your Flash briefings. You also have access t Tubi  (no account required) which is good if you done mine watching long programs on a 8” screen and others channels such as Hulu, NBC, Prime video, and kitchen all of which requires account linking.I also like that you can download pictures from your phone or Amazon cloud account and add them as background photos show.It’s also nice to have the ability to see the other person you call when both have echo devices with videos capabilities, leaving my phone free for other use.Resuming; what I most like of the echo show 8 is that it has a decent size screen which is the only thing that distinguish it from the others echo devices which does not have a screen. Voice recognition is no better then the others echo devices and I find the the sound quality is not better then the sound I got from my Echo plus even if it does have stereo 2.5” speakers on either side.What I most find disturbing of the Echo Show 8 is the Constance, annoying messages which appears at the bottom on the screen and which their isn’t any way to eliminate. Amazon please do a download update within the menu options to turn this feature OFF. It is stressing me out."
"Love it!The kids bought me the Show for Christmas and I just love it!  A few years back, they got us the Echo Dot, which was fine, but it certainly didn't get as much use as Show has been getting!What do I like about it?1. The sound is great2. The picture quality is great.3. When I ask a question, the answer is on the screen as Alexa reads it. Great for someone with hearing issues!4. Most questions I've asked have been answered well. Sometimes I don't phrase a question quite right, I guess.5. It looks great on my kitchen counter and doesn't take up a lot of room.Any complaints? Haven't found any yet."
"Great, except for the stupid ""Try...."" at the bottom of the screen.This would get a 5 star if I could disable that.  There is lot you can change, but you can't get rid of the stupid notes at the bottom to try this or that.  They seriously need a software update so that those can be turned off.  I have my home display to be my photos and this huge lettering across the bottom of the screen is super distracting and totally unnecessary.  If you can't figure out things to ask it, you shouldn't own it."
"TRADE IN BAD BUSINESS.I am a fan of Alexa and the Echo community. So, it was a no brainer for me to purchase the Echo Show 8. It was especially a treat to find out I could trade in my first gen Show. I am one who keeps the original box and takes good care of my devices.I returned my first-gen Show in the original box, by the way, it was working when I unplugged it and put it in the box. I was expecting to receive $30 for the trade-in and received $5 because the item was not working. To my surprise, that was the response I received.I am very disappointed because that was not the case and I can't get anyone to listen to me or verify. I am not in a good place. I would suggest not going the trade-in route, you don't know how you will end up."
"very pleased.I am very happy with this Echo 8, but I didn't give it a full 5 star rating because I have found it hard to set up a few things.  We really purchased so we could do 4 way video chats with parents and 3 kids, we can't figure it out and haven't been able to find answers yet on how to do it.  I would like to see a feature similar to skype that you can add a persons name - only to this alexa device and call them.  I want to call my son on it, but only for him to answer when he is at home.  I call him now and it rings on alexa and his iphone - which then I am interrupting him.  I guess maybe its better resources to use for those technically challenged"
"Highly recommend.I love my Echo Show 8.  The sound is EXCELLENT and mine is set at only 30.  I would like to make a suggestion though.  I love Lauren Daigle so when I ask Alexa to play her songs the words display on the screen.  I love this.  However when I set an alarm to music the word don’t display even when I request it.One more suggestion, I’d like the day of the week and the date to display on the home screen like on the Echo 5.  The Echo 8 doesn’t have this capability.Anyway the above can be added?Otherwise I highly recommend the Echo Show 8."
"A great upgrade.Easy to get up and running. Love the current, time, weather and news information in living color"
"Great addition to my household.I love this little unit.  I keep my Echo Show8 on my bedside table for use as an alarm clock. to view my Ring cameras, and to read my Kindle books, just before dozing off to sleep.  Why can't Prime members receive a minimal number of Audible books each month?I have an Echo Show5, that I keep on my desk to view the time, weather, and use to ask Alexa pertinent questions that I think of, while working at my computer.I have also noticed that the Alexa feature is ""learning"" the more I use ""her.""  BRAVO, Amazon!I use the Alexa app to make my shopping list, and can use it from my phone right in the store.  Saves me from making paper shopping lists, that seem to always get lost."
"Go with the 8 not 5.I bought this to compliment my Blink XT2 and I've read so many posts that it does not connect correctly, or only has audio feed but no video feed. Here's a few tips to get it to work properly. 1.) Make sure you have a strong wifi connection with proper bandwidth. 2.) Set your video quality resolution on the XT2's app to ""Saver"". There is a small noticeable difference in resolution/definition but if you want to show live video, this feature must be set to Saver mode for it to work. Until Blink or Echo Show updates it to accept high res. This is the only work around. The speaker is phenomenal, full amd rich that's comparable to the Echo itself. Go with the 8 rather than 5... better speakers and bigger screen. Hope this helps!"
Fantastic update to the original echo show.Much larger screen then our old echo show. The sound is so much better from amazon music. We like that Alexa provides a nice shortcut for her responses after she picks up on certain regularly used commands. No skipping like our old echo show after playingmusic.  Sound quality great and we are now fully integrated with smart plugs and smart bulbs throughout our home. Very good impression of this echo show so far!
"Sweet spot for features and value of all the Shows.The Echo Show is my favorite IOT device. We have three first gens, two second gens, a five (don’t care for the 5 at all) and now the eight...love it! The second gen has been my favorite as the display and sound are the best. It’s great for a large open space. We have it in our kitchen. For most spaces the eight will be perfect. Great sound and display. Amazon hit the sweet spot with value and features on this device!"
"Best value for your money in the Echo Show ecosystem.I've got all three Echo Show devices - full sized 2nd Gen, Echo Show 5, and now the Echo Show 8. I love all three of them, as each fills a specific niche in my home. Dollar-for-dollar, though, the Echo Show 8 is the best value. Uses the same resolution as the full sized model, and has comparable sound quality. Has all the same functionality as the 2nd gen, plus the added feature of having a physical camera cover, as opposed to the camera being software controlled on the 2nd Gen model. Fits nicely on my desk without getting in the way. The 2nd-Gen is the best of the lot, of course, but  the 8-inch model is a great choice on a budget."
Awesome Smart Home Control.We purchased this Echo Show 8 to incorporate our security system and other smart home products all in one place. We’re changing security platforms and the new one does not include a touch panel which we have become used to using. It sits in our living room. The speaker is pretty good definitely better than the initial echo and echo dots which we have in other rooms of the house. I like to listen to music on it often. It also works really well to Skype. Something I didn’t think I would use it frequently for. It’s nice for my son to be able to Skype with my parents without having to give him one of our phones. The screen is the perfect size.
"All around lacking.Where to start, it cant handle simple net searches only specific ones.  Trying to play a music video can be painful as well.  The whole house music is spotty since I added the show into the loop it now plays on 1 2 or all 3 devices depending on Alexa's mood I guess.... Not specific to this device but i noticed it after I got it I pay 14.99 a month for Amazon music yet more than half of what I was requesting Alexa was pulling from Spotify (If thats the case why wouldnt I just pay for spotify its cheaper).  I unplugged the whole lot tossed them in a box and am going to give the Google nest a shot at the very least I am betting it can do a simple net search.Positive note Echo's  do put out decent sound for there size"
"Another great Alexa.Like our new Show 8 a lot. Sound is great, Screen is great. Drove myself a little nuts trying to set up bluetooth the old way through the phone not knowing there were settings onscreen that took care of that. I hate the ""Try this Skill"" suggestions but everything I found so far is an enhancement to the tall tube type Echo. I thought the Echo Dot was included but looking back Amazon wants to make sure you're paying attention and press a button to get one. If you're giving them away to Show 8 buyers then give everybody who orders a Show 8 a Dot. Bottom line is this is the best Echo so far and if you want an Alexa buy this one."
"Great Sound Quality, looks nice on my counter.Really love my Echo Show.I Have it in my kitchen and its so handy to get info on what I need like recipes, weather, questions about almost anything.The sound quality is excellent.I play my playlists and holiday music stations while cooking or having dinner.It links in with my other devices and also shows my Wyse Camera.It's a welcome addition to my other devices so I can use as an intercom and drop in on other devices or announce dinner is ready.Finding more handy things to use it for with the helpful tips.You can put it on do not disturb if you don't want the helpful tips to show."
"Perfect for a kitchen.Got the echo show 8 for my kitchen to keep me company while cooking , to face-to-face talk with my sister, to listen to music and look up recipes. I also have been using it as a weather reporter and a calculator. I also like the announcement feature.  Every day I’m finding more uses. So far I like it although it was a little confusing setting up the video calling. I would definitely recommend the echo show 8. It is a perfect size; any bigger and it would be intrusive on my countertop. Sound is decent; it’s no Bose, after all. I also have the echo show 5 that I use as an alarm clock, etc. in the bedroom. Love that one, too."
"Excellent  Device.I have not had any kind of ""show"" device before. I do have 4 other types of Echos in my home.This device exceeded all expectations.I knew that it would show my Ring doorbell video, and had good reviews for sound. But when every day I am discovering something new. I did a video chat with my sister who has a Show device. It can tell me the internal temperature of my room. It has an autodimming feature for night time, and shows a clock (I threw away my digital tableside clock I had for years). To say I am impressed is an understatement. It even showed the lyrics to a song I asked it to play!Great job, Amazon!"
Larger screen than my Show 5 which works better in the kitchen...Second Show for me. The Show 5 is on my desk and the Show 8 is in the kitchen and is easier to see when used for recipes and videos. I get my morning Flash Briefing now on this device and it has advantages over my Echo Plus. The main being a few of the segments have videos that are not able to be seen on the Echo Plus of course. I like the way the Show devices not only tell you the weather but give you a screen with a few hourly forecasts. The ability to see a short video on the recipe prep is also quite handy. I like to say Hi to friends in the morning while I am making breakfast and it is certainly better with video.
"Best Home Companion.I've been a fan of the two Echo Dots (one for each level of the house) we have, asking Alexa for local weather or the question of the day or any number of tidbits of information. I saw this screen version at my mother-in-law's home and knew I needed to add it to the mix, and boy am I glad I did. Not only do I continue to get all of the information/music/trivia I enjoy daily, but now I have a readout of the questions I've asked (just to make sure Alexa understands me) and of the information she offers me. I've also enjoyed the Art background that scrolls throughout the day, so in effect I get to visit my favorite art museums without having to travel any farther than my den chair. The quality of the screen images is superb, and the voice quality is sharp and clear. A great addition to the home!"
"Works great.I love all the Echo products. I started with the little disc ones and now have progressed to the Echo 8 with one in each room  I like that when you use the Ambiant noise, the fabulous choices come on the screen for selection with Amazon Prime. Good sound for everyday radio talk, and very convenient to be in any room and be able to ask time, weather, recipes, talk radio, music streaming or meditation mode. There is an off camera button to slide on top as well as a sleep mode that will sense when the room goes dark and dim down for sleep. Alexa still has a lot to learn, over all this is a great price for all she does."
"Already getting glitchy.This is my fourth Alexa device so I am familiar with how they work and our house is very integrated with Ring, Philips Hue, Honeywell and TVs. Also connected with dozens of skills.  The Show 8, within a month is starting to not support tasks. Example: “Echo, play pandora” (says ok, starts playing no problem). “Echo, turn off music in 2 hours” (says ok and repeats time to turn off). Then will not stop at time confirmed. 2nd example: if I verbally ask to then turn off music it does not respond. 3rd example. I manually turn the volume all the way to zero but it will after a period of time turn up the value on its own. 4 example: there is no way to make the screen fully black, so if your sensitive to blue light it is still very bright in the room, even after using the night settings. Sunrise settings are terrible also. Returning."
"Avoid.Very disappointed, it doesn't connect to ring service through the skill, so I can't watch the ring cameras that I have around the house. That was one of the main reasons why I bought it. I have contacted Amazon about the problem and I have talked with a service tech that acknowledge the problems but was not able to solve them. I was told that they would keep in touch with me but after the second unsuccessful phone call I haven't heard back....Maybe Amazon is just trying to avoid a returnAs far as other functions,  voice recognition is quite good. Sound is good for a device of that size.The screen looks good but the response to any touch action is very slow. It needs a faster processor, I would rather pay more for a device that works smoothly and without bugs."
"Keeps dropping Bluetooth Connection to FireTVStick, no full screen clock.I have couple of Show5s and one Show 8. Overall  great package for the price, better (not hi fidelity though) sound than Show5. Couple of negatives based on my usage needs -Show5 has Clock faces that fill the entire screen allowing it it be used as a big Clock at night and able to view it from far. For some reason, these options are not available on Show8I planned to use this device as speakers for my FireTV stick and projector. It pairs well and FireTV streams sound to the device but  drops connection. It has to repaired back after rebooting Show 8 everytime. Which is very frustrating."
"GREAT HELP FOR ELDERLY.Love this. So much more useful than timers. I can turn different lights on/off and even schedule them. I can also control them with my voice or through the app in my phone.  I bought my parents these with Echos for Christmas. Because these make lights handsfree, they're perfect for elderly that need their hands for walker stability. They also love being able to use their voices to turn on/off their lights at night. I bought Echo shows to check on my parents too. I can sleep while listening to make sure they're ok after coming home from the hospital. Paired with the Ring doorbell, they can talk and see the nurses and caregivers."
"Good Quality Product.Love this thing. Keep it on the night stand. For one thing it doubles as a good looking clock radio for me plus working with our doorbell cam is great too. We can see who comes to the door, even talk to them through it. It does so many things, change house temperature, turn lights on and off, weather forecasts too many things to mention here  Have two dots in the house as well. Love em all."
"If not for ads, this could have been a five star product.I like the screen/display. Nice and vivid easy to look at, but also easy to see the never ending ""Try this with Alexa ad at the bottom. I find it ridiculous that Amazon has this on there without a way to get it off. Also ""Alexa is not so smart. Everyday I ask something and get a ""Huum, I dont know that. I am done with these stupid Alexa devices until Amazon gets the ads off, and these things can begin to answer more questions. For now all these Alexa enabled devices are more like eavesdropping machines more than a help. i.e...To this day I still cant get two or more Dot 3's to play music in a group."
"Definitely an upgrade over the old Echo Show!This Show 8 has the same size viewing screen as the original Show I had in my kitchen (that just died after a couple years).  I like it a lot!  The screen resolution is much improved and the sound is great.  It IS much lower to the counter than the old one because the old one had the screen above a speaker.  I decided to move this one to my master bathroom and get the new generation Show 10 for the kitchen.  Since I know it will sit lower on the counter and it needs to be seen over a lazy susan, I purchased a stand to raise it higher.  I am quite happy with this addition to my Alexa-enabled home."
Love it.Bought an Echo Show 5 earlier in the year. Was using in the kitchen and I liked it. Wanted one for the bedroom. When the new 8 was introduced I decided to order that for the kitchen and move the 5 to the bedroom. Loving the 8. Nice screen display which I have displaying a slide show of my photo galleries. Sound is much richer than the 5. Subtle differences vs the 5. The 8 is more refined and seems to offer more display options. Works well with my Wyze camera system. I currently have 6 Wyze cameras inside and outside of our home. Can view any of them upon voice request. Nice feature. Very happy with the purchase.
Nest Doorbell and Echo 8.I really like the Echo 8. The reason I can’t give it 5 stars is because it doesn’t have 2 way audio with my nest doorbell. I don’t understand why it has 2 way with ring doorbell but not with nest? I think the nest doorbell is better I don’t want to change. I haven’t sent it back hoping Amazon will correct this problem. Amazon customer service was not helpful at all on this matter.
"I. Love. It!What don’t I like or dislike? Hmmm... I love everything about my new Echo Show 8! The screen is a great size and clarity, the sound quality is beautiful, it looks great on my counter. My 2 1/2 year old grandson loves playing The Letter of the Day with Elmo from Sesame Street while we eat lunch, and it’s awesome that he can see the letters on the screen. It’s not just for music - there is all kinds of educational activities available. It also has a shutter cover switch so you can cover the camera, and you can turn off the mic if you want - good features for those concerned about privacy."
"Sounds amazing, wish it would listen as good.Screen is great, sound is amazing, but the voice recognition is terrible (echo line wide) we replaced a dot with this echo 8 thinking the mic in our dot was going bad. Apparently it is just an echo thing in general now? Our first echo seemed too sensitive, anything remotely close to ""alexa"" would trigger it, then it started not picking up until I yell at it. The new one, along with our other 4 echos, all seem to have hearing issues. Maybe a firmware thing?"
"So good, but deserves to be better!I love this little thing. It has a good picture and really good sound. The UI is well thought out. The microphones pick up my voice, even when I whisper to test it's limits. I've connected and used my Spotify account for music. I've watched shows on it with Amazon Prime. Ahhhh, video. This thing is perfect to leverage video. I hope that Amazon is working with HBO Go, Hulu, and YouTube, of course. Content drives satisfaction of these devices and this screen based device deserves more video content.If give the hardware a 5, but the content gets a 3, selling in at a 4 overall."
Easy setup!!I was able to add this to my home with no issues. I did have a problem at first showing one of my Arlo camera's but suddenly it began to respond. It does show too many advertisements but that doesn't bother me like the others who have reviewed this item. I don't constantly look at the screen. Nice to be able to see my camera's around the house. The reason I gave it four stars is there is tremendous latency connecting to the cameras. Everything else on my network responds fine but this device. I'm hoping for a firmware fix. I'll update this review if I notice any changes in the future.
"doesn't support the ""show and tell"" feature that other gen Shows support.For some reason this doesn't support the ""show and tell"" feature that the Echo developers created in September that works on the 2nd gen of Echo Shows?? Why wouldn't a new gen product support features that work on 1st and 2nd gen products? Especially after they announced the new feature 3 months ago?The  ""show and tell"" feature was developed to help visually impaired users."
"Great Device!This is my 2nd Amazon Echo device and I’m very satisfied with my purchase. The screen quality is amazing and the sounds is far better than I expected. I was running my music through a different device but the Echo Show 8 will now be my default player. I was contemplating getting the 5” screen but held out for the 8” and I’m very happy I waited for this to be released. The screen size is perfect, not to big and not to small. If you a little older person and tech savvy the bigger screen is definitely easy to view. Great job Amazon!"
"The 8th show is groovy.This Show has very nice scenery for nature. Last night I found out that when I turned my light out, the show became very dark. Great because I didn’t have to go back make that happen. I just received this and have to get used to it. Already I have learned that I need to find a way to get some kind of speakers. If you are listening to music with deep bass it has to be lower. I don’t think it can do well With the speakers it has. But for the size And price it is good. The product is great. I will learn more as I go. I look forward to doing that. The 8th show is groovy. I like it!"
"I need a lot of help with this.The Show was a Christmas gift.  My son set things up.  However, it uploaded ALL of my photos from my camera.  Do I want a picture of my car battery on the Show?  No.  How about medically sensitive photos, which I have a lot of.  I can't even run the slide show for fear of what will be shown.  I deleted the Amazon photos app from my iPhone, but apparently it's too late, all those unwanted pictures are there, somewhere.  I need MORE CONTROL over this device.  It should only display photos I want displayed, not act as a vacuum to all my photos.  I'm not sure what to do next."
Even better than the original Echo Show.This one has a screen an inch bigger than the original Echo Show and less wasted space on the base. I have Alexa products in most rooms of my home. I am even gifting one to my family member this year since my family uses Alexa products in their home as well. I love how I can ask this to show my security camera and it notifies me when someone rings my Ring door bell. I can ask her to turn on my smart lightbulbs and even start my Ford car. She can even turn on my Vizio smart tv and retrieve Netflix on it. Inlove playing music on the everywhere group. Technology these days is great.
Excellent value.Set up was incredibly simple.  The screen is much more practical in my view than the Echo Show 5.  I was impressed that I could stop the cycling of comments and pictures.  I have it where my handicapped wife can see it and I can use drop in to check on her.  She was bothered by the changing screen.  The fact that I could turn that off made it great for our purposes.  The only thing I would prefer is if I could turn off the notification sound when I do a drop in to chech on her when she is sleeping.  Overall I am extremely impressed with it and have ordered a second unit.
"When adding features, the Alexa app should support integrating those features into routines.First, very annoying to constantly have the “Try xxxxxx” at the bottom of the screen.  Amazon—-Give us the capability to remove that.Supports web browser.  Not all cameras have “skills” so that they can be used.  However, I can access my cameras on the screen using the Silk Browser.  It would be nice if I can tell, in a routine, for Alexa to start the Silk Brower and start on a specific page or shortcut.Some of us want to do things that other people may not care to do.  However, if we can do it manually, or with our voice, then provide a way for us to do that in a routine."
"New addition to my echo family.I have had 2 echo dots for a few months now and I just love them! I had been thinking about getting an echo show for a few weeks, and when my daughter-in-law told me she got one, well I decided to get one so we could have a dedicated device for video chatting. I have my echo show 8 in my living room, it’s nice to have the clock and weather on the display, the sound quality of the echo show 8 is awesome, the same as my echo dots. I love that you can customize the display, as well as what you do with it, there’s a huge list of skills and games, and it’s added to each day. I’m very pleased with my echo devices."
Poor quality.Echo 8 was just delivered... what happened to the screen Amazon?
"Not as good as I hoped.Speakers don't seem as good as the 3rd generation Dots. Voice recognition to activate is not as sensitive as the Dots. Doesn't easily connect to Bluetooth. Connects but says non_supported device. Doesn't have Day/Date on home screen. Time size is not positional or changeable. Excellent display, crisp and clear. Good price if it can be figured out to work better."
Why can’t I customize the clock?I love everything except the settings for the clock. You seem to get way more settings with the 5” model. Sounds great for a bedroom. I would love to see the date but it goes away and I find myself waiting for it to return. I have set up the display and turned everything off and it still goes away. At night it doesn’t even show the date. I wish I could make the clock bigger like I can with the echo show 5.
"3/5.After moving on from an Echo Dot and Echo, I figured the Show 8 would be an ideal use for my kitchen. The screen looks good- and the sound quality is fine.I am sure I singing to the choir, but the ""Try XYZ"" tip on the bottom is awful. Inexcusable considering how easy it would be to add an on/off setting.A little ""larger"" than hoped- given the size of most micro laptops and even the RASP-PI units, there is minimal reason to be this large.Overall nice- but needs improvement. Would have returned if my wife didn't love it so much."
"I'm very entertained by this!I bought the Ecco Show so that I could have video calls with my son who didn't want to hold up the phone or iPad to FaceTime.  Anyway, we tired it and the image is okay but not fantastic.  I'm using it for other things and actually don't mind the scrolling messages along the bottom.  I did see that you can eliminate that in the settings. We both like the stands.  Now I'm using it to see who is at my ring door camera and it works faster than my iPhone or iPad.  I'm having a slight issue with voice commands for my security cameras but that might also be a setting."
"Alexa.It is definitely a great technology since the invention of the T.V. remote control. I have my own personal assistant without a bad attitude.It's easy to set up, WiFi password and your ready to roll. It recognized my Amazon music and prime video, which I wanted it for more than anything else. The screen is big enough to watch from a distance of four to five feet. The sound is good, but I'm using Bluetooth on my Bose speaker, another nice feature.The only thing negative so far is the scrolling at the bottom of the screen as in previous reviews. I haven't found a way to get rid of it. No real problem, but should not be there in all the time."
"Was not as easy as I expected!It was a gift. Hard to find where one needs to set up things....on Echo Show or on Phone app. The sound from it is way too Bass, and comes out of the backside....away from all ears! I miss seeing Green circling ring when a package has arrived like on the Echo Dot. (We have a long ways to go to get package from dirt driveway. Was nice to know “it” was delivered, to get it out of weather.) and she seems slow to respond to questions.I did have fun setting it up to turn on a Rooster Lamp, and have it, Echo Show, crow like a rooster 3 times...in the morning."
"Decent Display for HiFi Music.It is a good device. I would add ultra hd audio and an optical output to it. I would pay a lot more for that or for a big screened version like that. Also, if another device like an echo link is the speaker for this and playing amazon music, it should still show the album art and lyrics. I would also set it up like that with the speaker off in the everywhere group. I get around this by leaving the show volume on by turned down way low and it works well like that. This thing is still cool as a display for ultra hd music on my stereo and whole house audio systems."
"What did she say?My only quirk with Echo-8 is that Alexa’s voice seems muddled. I didn’t have as much trouble understanding her with my Tap.It may be the size of the speaker or how it’s placed in the Echo 8. I haven’t figured that out yet. I have the unit next to my bed on a night stand, I don’t have a stand for the unit, that may make her voice more understandable.I must say that Alexa has no problem understanding when I speak to her. One final note, I do wear hearing aids and that could be the determining factor in my having a difficult time understanding Alexia."
"Generally good, but microphone is way too sensitive.Generally pretty good - but there are two main issues. First, the microphone is WAY too sensitive - which is a big problem if you have multiple Echos. I'll be speaking directly to one Echo, it'll light like it hears me and then not respond, and off in the distance I'll very faintly hear this one talking. It's pretty annoying. I have ESP enabled and it still does this.The other thing is that Amazon keeps showing a list of things to try at the bottom, even though I turned that off in settings. Amazon, I've had your products for years, I know how they work! Please stop telling me useless things."
"Best echo show ever!I would say this is the best echo. It’s screen is just right. Not too small (echo show 5) and not too big (echo show). As I put it in my office desk it is perfect size.The sound is good, not great for its size. It has good bass when I set the bass to max in the equalizer sound setting.Having echo with screen is really helpful especially for me that I like listening to music, where I can see the lyrics when playing song on Amazon Music. I like to play music on different device not on my MacBook because I use my MacBook for coding, so playing music on dedicated device help me save some memory.The only issue I have is with youtube. It’s not easy to watch youtube as there is no youtube integration with the echo show. Opening youtube from the echo show browser is not straight forward. I wish amazon can work with google to have youtube integrated in the near future.I will recommend this device for those who wants to have a dedicated assistant while your doing your work on the office."
"Alexa Audio Quality.Overall, very satisfied with the Show and all its features with one exception, the audio. Alexa’s communication is somewhat unclear (too much base, muddy) although not nearly as bad as the echo dot 3 yet not as clear as the echo dot 2. There is a way to adjust sound for music play but apparently this does not apply to Alexa so understanding her requires concentration and repetition. It seems to me that this can easily be corrected by having the equalizer settings apply to her as well (this should also be done for the dot 3 which I no longer use due to the very poor muddled Alexa audio)."
"I like it so much that I bought 3 of them!My 86 year old dad lives with me and is hard of hearing. I love that I can “drop in” on him from my cell phone and this gets loud enough for him to hear me.  I also really like that I can see him too, and vice versa.  I think it’s perfect for the elderly because when you “drop in” they don’t need to answer it like a phone. It chimes letting them know you’re connecting and then you’re able to speak to them. I like it so much that I bought 3 of them to put in different rooms of the house. I can also view my blink xt and xt2 cameras on it!  The sound quality is good as well!"
"""Try Alexa..."" Ruins and otherwise stellar devise SEE UPDATES.Come On Amazon, You know you can fix this. I have turned off ""Skills"" in the home content and yet I still get ""Ask Alexa why is water wet?"" I'm never going to ask Alexa for crap like this. This ""feature"" is broken, you know it and even though all of your customers are complaining you refuse to turn it off in a software update. What do you hope to accomplish besides annoying your customers out of future purchases? I also have an Echo Show 5 on which I was able to get rid of 'try this"" but not on the 8. Fix it and I'll update my review. (Until then Gaffers Tape works...)Update: So the other day it was saying to ""Ask Alexa"" to call my deceased father... Thanks Amazon!  I had a chat with support in which they said ""it has already been escalated to be fixed in a future update"". They HAVE a switch (see pics) to turn it off that simply doesn't work on the Show 8, it does work on the Show 5. Turning on do not disturb works but makes the clock giant and breaks the photo stream from Albums you choose (just plays ALL photos on Amazon). None of the ""fixes"" others have listed turn it off. So if this is a deal breaker for you don't buy it. They know it's broken and I don't think they want to fix this ""feature"" that is only annoying their customers. Fix the switch, anybody who wants it can turn it on.Update 1/6/20 So 2 days ago the the mind numbing madness that is ""Tey Alexa"" was...Gone. They seemed to have heard our cries of pain folks (not sure what they did the OS hasn't been updated since November. Ponderous). I waited 2 days to update this so hopefully it's done. Now this is a stellar device which I can highly recommend if want a great photo frame, decent speaker and smart home assistant!"
"It has trouble understanding us.I wanted to love this.  I purposely purchased it to view our Blink cameras, but it won't do it.Whenever we ask to show ""blink"" it keeps trying to connect us to something called blinkist.  It was a complete PITA to try to get it to show the cameras.It's nice looking.  It has good sound quality and it was easy to connect to our existing network, but if it can't understand what we're saying, it's got to go back.  Also, the times I could get it to check the camera, it wouldn't disconnect from the camera, so the camera was ""busy"" all the time.  This just won't work for us."
"What works on Echo 5 does not work on echo 8.I have had the 5 for awhile and am happy with it except for the screen size and resolution.  I was able to turn off the ""things to try"" so I bought the 8.  Totally different menus and menu choices.  I've tried everything but can't turn off the irritating ""ads"".  I'll keep it hoping that Amazon will wake up someday and get rid of those STUPID suggestions popping up all the time."
Very nice.Echo 8 has proven to be an additional asset to our everyday business. Having upgraded from an echo dot this is truly a family favorite offering even more features then expected. Our dot had excellent sound quality but we find the Echo 8 is not quite as good. We are still tweaking the 8 and hopefully will find a setting that satisfies us. Integration to our ring devices and wink devices was quick and easy. Voice recognition is very good but there is always improvements that can be made. All in all we are very happy with the 8 and its additional functionality.
"Amazon, remove the “Things to try” text from const flashing on screen.  Annoying and unnecessary.On the Echo Show 8, impossible to remove these stupid things to try tutorials.  Turned off discover, turned off all notifications and a non-stop barrage of “Try this, try that” always flashing on my screen distracting me while I’m trying to work.  DND temporarily turns them off, but also prevents the device from receiving notifications or calls... making it a useless paperweight.  For now, I’ve fixed it with a strip of black electrical tape.  Maybe someday Amazon will listen to their customer feedback and take some sort of action to correct... maybe"
"Does What I Bought Bought It For and More!I bought this for my kitchen to be able to see a recipe. Instead of constantly having to open up my screen on my phone to see a recipe while in the midst of making it, I can now use my voice. Yes, I can adjust my phone screen time but then I have to remember to reset it back. As this is a security measure,  I love the Echo Show because it's so convenient and much a more secure way to cook as it never leaves the house and doesn't have all the info stored in my phone.And the music sounds incredible too!Might have to look into a larger one down the road."
"Great in the kitchen!We already had a couple of echo dots in the house, and love them.  We use them to make shopping lists, report the weather, reminders, timers, and smart home controls.  We find the voice recognition to be superb- much better than other voice enabled devices.  The echo show adds another layer of sophistication- a screen.  So when I’m cooking, I can view the recipe, and not worry about using my messy hands to scroll through the recipe- I just ask Alexa to scroll down or up, or move to the next step in the recipe.  The screen also works well with lists- if I add an item to my shopping list, it automatically pulls up the list, showing the new item as well as the existing items.  Asking for weather also pulls up a visual.  Originally the echo was around $300.  I recently got a deal that gave me an echo show and an echo dot for around $80.  At this price point, you can’t go wrong!"
"Absolutely love the echow show and would recommend it!I absolutely love my echo show 8, I spent hours debating on getting this one or the 10 and trying to decide which one was better for the affordable price and I am telling you with my black Friday deal it was definitely even better. The only differences that kept me going back and forth were that the 8 has a 1 megapixel camera where as the 10 has a 5 megapixel camera and the 10 is 2 inches bigger but let me tell you the camera is great, sound quality amazing and loud so no regrets here! I might still get the echo show 10 down the road just because I love my alexa/echo gadets but right now I am thrilled and happy with my echo show 8. I would highly recommend it. I have for my kitchen while I'm cooking and trying new recipes, want to watch youtube or hulu."
"Very nice smart display.People mostly cross shop this one with the 7 inch Google nest Hub and I have played around with both so I will give you my thoughts.  If you are deeply embedded into google products, especially google photos I would stick with the Nest Hub.  Your google photo collection will not pair nicely with Alexa, you will have to transfer everything to Amazon Photos.If you need a camera, you have to go with Alexa.  Also the Alexa has way better speakers so if you want to crank tunes, Alexa blows it away.  Other than that VERY VERY similar."
"Not good for video calling!The product itself looks good and is sturdy etc. I was trying to find a way to video call family and friends and it ONLY, ONLY workds with Skype (please correct me if I am wrong). Who uses Skype nowadays? I don't, my friends don't, nobody does lol. To me easy video calling is one of the most important features and in this product it is lacking. So if you WANT video calling try to get Facebook Portal, it uses MESSAGER and WHATSAPP (which is SO SO widely used internationally and FREE). Skype sometimes wants to charge you for international calls ( I could be wrong)Other then that, if you're looking to use Spotify and Itunes Music it is ok. And the regular Alexa funtions.I was so excited to get this product but I got disappointed with the video calling limitations."
"Love my new Gadget!!Placed this Echo in my kitchen. First time with a screen and love the ability to use with recipes, news and lyrics with Amazon music. Love the touch screen and still learning all the things she can do. This is my 2nd Echo as I have a Dot. Would like to have more detailed instruction from Amazon about skills and apps but learning as I go. Would buy again!!"
"Best thing is the sound quality.I previously had just echo dots so this is definitely an upgrade. That said, I loathe the try this, try that... The fact Amazon isn’t allowing it to be turned off is a travesty. Thus the lower rating, simply no reason not to have a choice. The most impressive thing so far is the sound quality, I cranked up my Sirius and Iheartradio and am very pleased with the quality especially the equalizer settings. I have had an issue where it stops responding and required a unplug/re-plug, looking online I see some have had a similar issue, hopefully this won’t continue as it’s a pain to have to do that. Overall, it’s a solid device."
"Failure of photo slide show.Generally like; would rate 5 if not for the issue with the slide show, about which I've spoken with Amazon support several times and they are supposedly working on the issue. I also have a Show 5, which does not have the same problem. With the Show 8, the photo slide show does not run continuously like on my Show 5. It goes to sleep for some reason and I have to tap the screen to start it up again. This is not acceptable and I may return the item if not resolved. Can't believe Amazon doesn't quality test a new product to make sure it works at least as well or better than the previous version.Thanks."
Alexa is Helpful!!We keep our Echo Show in the kitchen. We do so because she actually helps us with recipes and with cooking itself. We set timers for everything. We maintain our shopping list on Alexa. We listen to music and have questions answered. We are almost dependent on her. Our real story is that we had one and over time we started to hear a bit of static at times. So we had to purchase a new one. We didn't have the heart to let our first one go so we moved it to the bedroom and now we can talk to each other using the Echo. Love this product and all it can add to your life!
"Beware: Used/Smudged Amazon Echo Show 8 shipped as NEW.Received Echo Show 8 (Sandstone) yesterday and quite excitedly opened the box this morning to be disappointed to see black smudge marks on the speaker (back) area of the Echo Show 8, very obvious on Sandstone model.Called Amazon customer Service and they agreed to issue a replacement order but could not get any satisfactory response on how a brand unit have so obvious smudge marks and finger prints on the screen, unless it was a used (retuned item), shipped as new, which is very unsettling for a long term Amazon consumer for 17 years.  While they agreed to issue a case for investigation but declined to share any findings and almost denied that it was not a used/retuned item that was shipped to me.  I have attached the picture and the marks are even more obvious with naked eye and across multiple edges of the Echo Show 8 device - the only explanation is that it is a used/retuned item.I am very infrequent with my reviews and my first NEGATIVE review, but thought it was my responsibility to my fellow consumer friends and highlight, a possible misuse of shipping of used Amazon products as NEW, which is nothing short of “bad practice”.  Will wait for the replacement to check out how it operates, but for now it is boxed back and ready to be shipped back (retuned to Amazon) while I await my replacement, which is back ordered."
"Improved sound, improved form factor, poor backwards integration. Some setbacks with setup.Overall, a nice device to integrate into our home setup (more than 2-dozen smart devices, in an IoT integrated home).We've had the first generation of Show devices since they came out and I was excited to see the upgrades. Hands down, the sound quality is greatly improved! Nice improvements to the deeper bass sounds, although I could argue to almost to the point that the highs drop out.Mostly, I was disappointed that my app didn't allow me to add this to our home and that the device doesn't allow some of the new features (like stereo pairing) with older devices. This seems lazy to me.I didn't like that I had to enter the passwords of our account into the device multiple times to set it up.Overall, if I don't have to change configurations too many times, I think I'll like this. But if it is as much of a hassle to change wifi passwords requiring multiple accounts, I'll probably ditch the whole Alexa line-up."
"Love, but has glitch!Love this, but it won't run my entire routine.  I contacted customer support, and they told me to unplug my device and restart it and to also disable my routine and re-enable it. I have unplugged and restarted my device twice, and I have completely deleted my routine and put a new one in to Alexa but to no avail.  I still can't get my routine to run completely on this Echo.  My other Echo devices run my routine just fine.  Other than that, I have no issues with the Show. I really love the ease of use, how easily I can access information, listen to music, stream, and communicate!"
"excellent! we love it.wow! i got this for my wife but we all love it. i can check the video doorbell, and even make regular phone calls on it. sound quality is amazimg, picture is clear, ease of use and set up is a breeze.the only thing i would change is the little ""try saying..."" things that stay on bottom of screen on home page"
Love the Echo and now the Echo Show.I got this for the bigger screen.  I love it as much as I have my Echo spot.  I have so much integrated into Alexa that these little gadgets are a big part of my life.  We use it to control all the lights.  No more searching for lightswitches or trying to handle those with full hands.The Show has a big enough screen that when trying to find a recipe I can read it on the screen.  Big enough to enjoy making calls with.  Have been watching videos on it and enjoying those.  Important part of our home now.
"We like it a lot.We enjoy the games and storytime. It will play movies and videos from available sources and the sound quality it great. The picture quality is really good as well. I really enjoy how everything I want to look up is so easy to access. Shopping or recipe searching, it's all super easy with clear pictures and great information display.The only thing that bothers me is the issue we have with all our Dots, it will activate and start spouting information when it is triggered by a similar word to it's wake word."
Great echo device.This is how the echo show 5 should have featured. I was slightly disappointed with the show 5's inability to hear me correctly and it's slow reaction to touch. I have little issues with this and Alexa hearing me. It's quick and works usually to what I say. Sound quality is great and of course better than the 5. Screen is quite big as expected so I use this in the living room and I can see it from across the room.  I wish I could adjust the font size;  it needs to be just slightly bigger with the bigger screen.
"Love it so far!I bought this for my mom and I at Christmas, so we could have the joy of spending time together, cooking and working out even when there’s distance between us!  We have Only had it For a few weeks but so far I love it!!!  I’m curious if I can also use it as a electronic photo frame to look at my pictures, but haven’t look into that yet.  Either way it was much worth it!I also purchased a screen protector which I think is kinda crap but it does the job for now, but I do also recommend the more expensive stand that allows you to move the screen in all directions.  It’s magnetic and very sturdy which is perfect if using it in the kitchen, you definitely want something to hold it so you don’t have to worry about spills.  Like I said so far very excited about this product but still learning all the functions"
"ALEXA WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL MY LIFE.I never thought of purchasing Alexa because of privacy concerns on the news regarding these types of home assistants. Our daughter gave us Alexa Echo Show 8 for Christmas and now we’re so happy to have it. Privacy concerns are simple to address following their instructions. It’s nice to have recipes, weather, music etc without having to use our iPhones for everything. Plus it connects easily to other smart home features. We love it &amp; wonder why we waited so long to connect!! I highly recommend this tech product."
"Love this more than I thought I would!I didn't know how much I'd truly love this thing!! The screen is huge, wau bigger than I thought it would look.  The sound is amazing.  I love that the screen always has information on it, even if I didn't request it. Being able to see commands is great.  It shows the songs that are playing,  with lyrics. I just love everything about it, more than I thought I would. Its connected to our ring,  so I can easily see who's outside as well. Just a really fun device to have.  Very happy with the purchase!"
"Best Sound Quality of all Echo Products.I bought this after already owning an echo dot (3rd gen), an echo plus and a show 5. I was very impressed with the improvement of sound quality, the sound quality on this is better than the echo plus and the echo show 5. Other than that it is pretty much a larger version of the show 5. We love it, I will be using this one in my kitchen regularly as an aid for cooking. It’s very convenient to have recipes up on the screen and set multiple timers if you’re multitasking."
"No brained for kitchen/downstairs entertainment areas. Newsy is underrated for headlines.Unbelievable value especially when purchased during a sale. Sound could be a little more crisp. I’m torn with this and the new studio in the downstairs main living areas. I want the features of the echo show in the kitchen entertaining areas, but I want the huh end sound of the studio for playing loud music. I ended up adding the sub to this and overall it’s good. But I wish the sound was a little bit higher in quality. I would purchase again if I could. I’ve even purchased as a gift for family members."
"routine not working.i have an abode alarm and it worked perfectly with my echo spot. when i saw echo show 8, i like the bigger screen compared to my echo spot. however, i realized that the routines i have set up with my abode and echo spot does not work anymore with my echo show 8. i plugged back my echo spot to verify my routines and still worked with my echo spot but not with my echo show 8. i chose my routines to broadcast in echo show 8 but still did not worked. i hope amazon will do an update to correct this."
"Love it so far!I got this since it was on sale on Black Friday and so far I love it. I was already familiar with Alexa so it was very easy to set up, especially for a grandmother!  At first when I was getting in bed I thought the screen was too bright and busy for sleeping but when I turned off the light, it went very dim and the only thing showing was the clock and it was bigger so I could see it. But not so much to keep me awake. So the ""night mode"" for me is a great feature but I do like the simple things. The suggestions at the bottom do not bother me like it does some. The reason why I gave only 4 stars on sound quality was because it gives off almost an echo when Alexa talks, unlike my Echo Dot. But I am sure I can play with that a bit."
"""SHOW"" Me More!The Echo Show adds another dimension of visuals to the Alexa experience. Time, weather, photos are always available on the screen continuously set by your own preferences. The speaker sound is clear and full and when the room light turns on, it changes from dark screen with time display, to my preferences of photos, time, weather, and calendar. Everything the Alexa column can do it does it too, but with the add plus of visuals. Also love the ability to turn the camera on and off for privacy."
"Great Upgrade for the Echo Show Generation 1.Although this doesn't have the Dolby system processing, it's a great upgrade for the first generation of the Echo show, which looks kind of clunky and has both stereo speakers in the front next to each other.  This one sounds just about as good, the stereo separation is better, and the screen is a little bigger, even though the overall unit is smaller than the original show.  Also if you act now, you can turn in your old show for $30 plus get 25% off a new show ... great deal, don't miss it!"
Great Concept!!!!I love these things! Got one for my kitchen and one for the bedroom!
Nice Add To Echo Family.This is a perfect add to the Echo Family.  As an early adopter of Alexa I have just about every device.  I used the Amazon Trade In offer on this and traded my Spot.  I like the larger screen like on my Echo Show gen 1.  This was very easy to set up and paired easily with my Echo Clock.  I use it in my kitchen and the size is perfect.  I have had none of the issues that some have described in their reviews.  It works all of my smart home devices with no issue as well.  A nice little device.
"Good kitchen accessory.Alexa is very helpful for music, the news and finding recipes. You can ask Alexa to find a recipe for just about anything and she will give you list to select from. She can show you any of your smart home security cameras and find most videos that I look for.The only reason I took off 1 star is that Alexa is not even close to as good as google. She cannot find most of the things I ask for. I would say if they improve her search functions I will give it the 5th star in an update."
"handy kitchen pal.Bought this to upgrade from Echo Dot and am very pleased with its usefulness.  Have used it to message connected family members, set reminders, find recipes, play music and podcasts, check the news and weather, and ask for misc info as needed. Happy with screen resolution, and the sound is way better than I expected. As to the prompts about skills - I kinda like them.  I've discovered some that are very handy and some that are kind of fun that I otherwise wouldn't have known about.  And I don't have to pay attention if I don't want to."
"Stop with the Things to Try!I really wanted to like the Echo 8, but I can’t. The things to try at the bottom of the screen are beyond annoying and border on stupid. And trust me when I tell you that, with the Echo 8, there is NO WAY to turn this off.Three stars for the things it can do well, but please allow those of us who care about aesthetics to TURN THIS OFF!"
"Easy setup but does not do What I was hoping it would do.It does everything the Echo Dot does but I was hoping it would access more apps from my fire stick. It would be nice if it could access my recast TV and then we could watch pre-recorded shows and television in our kitchen where it’s located. They made it sound like it could access all the apps and everything I read.As it turns out it was only access prime Hulu and photos plus for some reason NBC. Hopefully in the future they will be doing upgrades to this. I got it on Black Friday pricing so I didn’t waste a lot of money and it is good for what it does do, but I was hoping for more"
"Love this device and all it can do!I bought an Echo Show 5 earlier and like this larger sibling much better, mostly because of its bigger screen--which makes things easier to read and view from farther away--and better sound. I expect that I'll eventually buy a couple more to replace earlier, more limited Echo devices I own that are spread around my home. One knock I had on the Echo Show 5 was that even at its highest brightness setting, the images, etc., seem too dark to me. For whatever reason, that isn't a problem on the Show 8."
"Its pretty good, except for...I actually like the Show 8 a lot except for one thing: the ""Try"" suggestion nag at the bottom of the home screen. It can not be shut off and it bugs me more each day. I already get suggestions for Alexa in email a couple times a week. I do not need this on the Echo Show! I am not alone in this, as Amazon's own forums and many blogs online also feel that this nag should be controllable by the user. Amazon has been telling people who complain about it that they will pass it on to ""the development team""... they have been saying that since the first device in late 2017! I may yet return it even though it does work well... just want that extra bit of control over the ""Try"" nag..."
"A great product everyone should have!I have not even utilized most of the features available on the Echo Show 8, but I still love it! I don’t know why people complain so much about the messages across the bottom of the screen. It’s not like you are staring at the screen all day! The scenery changes during the day so it’s not the same screen or you can customize it. I just love being able to view things while hearing about it by Alexa. My favorite so far are the recipes, but it shares news articles that I wouldn’t have seen if it weren’t for the “Try This“ tips showing across the bottom of the screen. The screen is HD and looks really great even watching YouTube and music videos. I love the video call feature as well. It’s just a great product that I would recommend to anyone!"
"More capability than I know what to do with!8 inch display is clear and bright. To my mind the extra money to get the display over the plain echois well worth it. One of the nice things I like is that the display continously puts up hints of various commands. One time it told me to say ""Alexa, watch Jack Ryan"". Sure enough, just that easily I was watching Prime Video Jack Ryan. I had no idea I could do that!The speakers are very good, much better than I expected!  Surprisingly good bass. The unit is a lot heavier than one would expect, I am guessing because of big speaker magnets.The capability to listen and recognize commands from several feet away is better than I expected as well.I recommend this!"
"Great quality!I was pleasantly surprised when I plugged in my echo show 8. For what it is, the sound quality is quite good. The video quality is good as well.All of these reviews complaining about “try Alexa” text on the screen are unwarranted. I have posted a picture. Change a few settings and all of that goes away. My screen displays my photos, time and a weather snapshot.My son loves this thing! Ee has a dot to start and he had sun with it.  But with the show, he can see videos when we call Santa or when we play animal workout. I bought him the kids for for Christmas. He may not want that after experiencing the show lol."
"Great device for physically disabled shut in, and just plain helpful and fun to use for everybody.First I love this thing, I loved that my wife loves this thing, this was a Xmas present for her, she is in a full time care facility, this echo show allows her choose and play the music and entertainment she likes, without a care givers help, it enables her to call me anytime, and let's me drop in and visit her, I connected it to care facilities WiFi, trained alexa for her voice, and disabled a few things like movie trailers and web browser, until she gets more experience using it"
"Lacking basic screen customization.The Show 8 lacks customization options that the Show 5 apparently has.  You can change the background and what data scrolls through, but the size of the time, the temp and showing today's date at all are not options.  You also constantly get Alexa suggestions.  Many tips on customization seem to be for other devices as there is no ""Home and Clock"" setting on the Show 8.  The only clock setting is 24 HR.  My mistake for thinking the 8 and the 5 had similar features, but the Show 8 options seem very lacking for any device with a screen.  But then the misleading tips on using the Show 8 didn't help that misunderstanding.The frustrating thing is that the Show 8 is almost a very good product. It just lacks basic customization which takes away from its other features.  If it had the UI of the Show 5, likely this would be a 5 star review.  As it is, the Show 8 screen just doesn't give much value add."
"Nice gadet.Make sure that you have it someplace that is on obstructed all that way around, otherwise it won't pick up the voice commands. Ours was moved off the breakfast bar to the counter and now voice commands are not heard except in the kitchen. It can be frustrating because of its tendency to stop playing spotify playlists after a few songs, resume command  gets it going again (known issue for several years now).  Also wish they would make the annoying ""try this skill"" banner go away."
"Amazon fix the Home Screen Try, ""Alexa . . . "" notification. Allow user to turn this off.Would be a five star review if Amazon would provide a way to turn off the very annoying “Try, “Echo . . .”” that is alway rotating on the home screen. Come on Amazon, a software fix allowing deselection of this “feature” would make many more of your customers happy as this seems to be the number 1 complaint in the reviews. Looking forward to a fix so I can change my rating to the 5 stars the device deserves."
"Only disappointed as it was not clear that this model didn't have the show feature.I originally bought this for my wife, who is blind, to use the show feature which was advertised to describe things held in front of the camera.  Apparently this feature is on the first generation and the second generation but not on this model. I subsequently bought a second generation for my wife and kept this one for myself.  I like how it will display the lyrics on many songs it plays. The sound quality is very good. I have not watched video on it as I use my Fire for that."
You will love the Alexa show.She doesn't seem to listen as well as the echo. But still does a wonderful job. I like the fact now that we can connect all of them together for music in every room. It is nice having the screen. When you play music now the words come up on the screen. When you set a timer it shows you how many minutes are left on the screen. It has many advantages. We just don't know what life would be like without Alexa. She lives in all of our houses. and almost all the time works flawlessly.
"Not that great using with Arlo.The main reason I ordered this was to view my Arlo cameras.  Seems I'm not the only one that has conductivity problems.Works sometimes with a bit of messing around, but overall it's not what I was expecting.  If there is a fix for it I would appreciate someone letting me know.  I do like the Alexa stuff though I have all of them,  this one just fell a little short.One more thing, the search engine for alexa has alot to be desired, I wish it were something other then Bing it has a problem finding a lot of things on the web.  Definitely not Google."
"Mostly great.Mostly very satisfied with this alexa device.  We bought it primarily for the slideshow feature to replace an old digital photo frame in our kitchen.  The Show 8 that we bought looks good and is the right size, but I'll be damned if I can figure out how to change the speed at which the pictures change in the slideshow.  I've searched hi and lo, and while there are instructions for doing this, they do not match the preferences/options in our device.  So, the pics change really, really slowly.  Hoping this gets fixed in a firmware update or something."
"This is the one to get!We first started by getting the Echo Show 5 and loved it!  I had to order the 8!  Totally in love with these.  Amazing sound, great response to commands/requests.  And love that it shows the time and weather on it.We plan on buying these next year for the family for Christmas."
"Love item, upset with Amazon.Love the eco. Easily pulls up ring cameras, change temps tires, find recipes, make announcements thru home when dinners done with other devises. I am upset that I purchased this item with a Christmas promotion to get a free eco dot. Then when I received and opened box, no eco dot included. Customer service told me I didn’t check the box, which I did. So item is nice but I am upset Amazon did not keep their promo deal when I purchased this during their marketing campaign."
"Can’t get rid of the annoying messages by Alexa.Specifically, can not turn off Alexa from constantly displaying, “try this.....blah, blah”Also, can not turn off the blurred edges on my displayed photosDoes not display the live camera feeds from Arlo."
"Great device with 1 downside for me.This is another great device from Amazon. The sound quality is great for as small as this device is. Works as expected. One downside for me (which is why 4 stars instead of 5) is the show uses WiFi data continuously. I have a data allowance per month I am allowed to use on my home WiFi. The echo dots do not use WiFi until you tell it the ""wake"" word. This would be a nice feature to turn on/off on the show devices for others out there with the same problem. Was told my Amazon customer service that this is not a feature on the Echo Show 8."
"Alexa is here to stay.So far so good. Alexa has been helpful with my little set up. Always handy for asking questions (it's a little sad that she keeps my company). However, like other users I find the ""try alexa....."" to the bottom of the screen a bit irritating. I also thought this new device had a built in hub, no such luck. But I guess that was my error. I am fascinated that I'm learning and finding out more features/skills everyday, so all in all.....I am satisfied with the device"
"Hate it.Got this thinking it would work with new Blink cameras, but what good is it when it won't show video or warning when cameras are motion-activated. Amazon says the Echo Show and the Blink software doesn't allow that. That renders it useless. And the Try ""Alexa"" suggestions that CONSTANTLY appear across the screen are driving me batty. There's no way to stop them, it just makes me want to take EVERY Alexa device in my house and throw them into the garbage bin. I should've listened to the other reviewers. That Try ""Alexa"" thing is like living in The Twilight Zone...it just won't stop, it keeps coming after you. I'll give Amazon one week to fix that...give me a way to turn it off, and if not...then I'll be sending this thing back."
"Beats Google Nest Hub because it has a browser and a few more features.I have both the Google Nest Hub (7 inch display) and the Amazon Echo show 5 and 7.  There were a few things that reviews online did not emphasized and actually place Google as the winner between the 2 and I have a different opinion because of the following.  I think Echo show is a better option for some because of the following...1.  Echo Show 8 has a bigger screen than Google Nest Hub.  Echos Show 5 is about $20 less the Google Nest Hub.2.  Contrary to beliefs, Echo Show 5 and 8 are capable of showing YouTube videos via the Firefox Browser.3.  Echo Show 5 and 8 have 2 accessible web browsers.  Google Nest Hub does not have an accessible web browser, which you can use to view websites.4.  If you have Amazon Prime, you can watch Amazon Prime videos.  You can't on Google Nest Hub. (Althouth you can watch youtube tv on the Google Hub, which you can also do on the Echo show 5 and 8.5.  You can also link your Hulu Service to Amazon Echo 5 and 8 and watch Hulu on it.  You can not watch Hulu on Google Nest Hub.  Although there are some workarounds on casting from device to device.  You are better off just getting a streaming service device on your television than have it cast and bog down your wifi.  I have both Google and Amazon infrstructures at my smart home.  I like Google as well, but Amazon Echo show proved to be more useful for my needs."
"Great Buy.My Echo Show is my alarm clock, visual display of timers and alarms, shows me my Kindle library, is playing an audible book as I write.  Having both audio and visual display is a definite plus.  The screen resolution is excellent as is the sound and if I wish, I can easily stream videos at my bedside rather than using my phone or having to use my laptop.  (My bedroom tv cannot hold an internet signal without a boost and I have my Fire stick in the living room."
"Less setting options than Echo Show 5.I have been very please with my Echo Show 5, which I use on the nightstand in the bedroom. A great feature is the option of a large digital clock that can be easily seen without glasses at night. I purchased an Echo Show 8 for the living room. Unfortunately the large digital clock is not available. The only option is a small clock in the upper left corner of the screen. Its too bad that Amazon offers a larger device with less options. I hope that future software update will correct this."
"Great upgrade.I have several Echo's, 2 Dots and a Regular Echo and this is a definite upgrade. Sound is high quality and it can do all the great thing of the other Echos,but the screen adds alot to the mix. During music, it shows lyrics and band pics. you can make video calls with other show devices. The best is that it works with several camera devices, that can display on the screen with just a few words. Works with Ring, Arlo and Wyze devices. Really like this device."
"its big enough to see.its bigger than my spot. I love the video connect. It still a little slow understanding my southern accent. would like to have clock and date displayed like the spot, not stuck up in the corner. I like being able to turn camera off. would have liked to have more indept instruction, like trying to add slide show to screen saver of photo from my photos, got caught up in amazon photo and it only down loaded some of my photos not the ones I checked to be in screen saver. would love to have a choice to stop all the advertisement. I recommend the show. I would give it a 5 star if the instruction was better and advertisement I could stop."
"Makes a great bedside clock radio.After thirty-some years my old clock radio died. It was a hi-fidelity stereo unit, with great sound and FM reception. And one morning it just didn't work anymore. I tried a couple of other models promising good sound quality, but in each case was dissatisfied with their display and controls. Almost our of desperation I tried the Echo Show 8 with Alexa. The sound quality is great, and once you get the hang of the voice commands it's easy to set. I wish it gave me more control the clock display, but that's a minor nit. I'm impressed by the number of radio stations (I'm an NPR geek, and all the stations I listen to I can get), and by the way it connects to my Spotify account.  Since it's internet and not over-the-air, the sound quality is fabulous. And Alexa works hard to do what I ask. All in all a great buy!"
"1 HUGE fault.I really want to love this product, and will be the first to repurchase if the blaring issue is fixed. I returned the Echo Show 8 because there is currently no way to stop the suggestions that pop up on the bottom of the screen offering suggestions for thins to ""try"" saying to Alexa!As of the middle of December in 2019 there is no way to disable this feature. You can reduce the number of annoying things that pop-up, but you cannot turn this feature off. Anyone who says otherwise is incorrect as of this review.Please Amazon, fix this ridiculous issue!"
"Auto Home Timeout is Frustrating when viewing items.The echo Show 8 was purchased to hopefully replace a Fire 8 and/or Fire 10 tablet that was being used in the kitchen for recipe preparation from a web url.  When firefox or silk is invoked and you navigate to the site to review/use a recipe or possibly other viewing, the Show 8 times out the browser and returns to the home screen.  This makes it almost unusable for our desired major use.  If you plan on using a static screen through one of the browsers, you will be disappointed currently.  Hopefully this will be changed soon to allow it to stay within a specifically invoked browser.  Otherwise, we really like the device and welcomed it to our home.  Music is reasonably good and smart home interaction is good also."
"Another great Alexa product.Having fun with my Echo Show, love the rotating photos of my grandbabies, also love seeing my calendar, easy to set up 'routines', with one phrase, ""Alexa, good morning""  I get the weather, my calendar and a daily affirmation.  When I bought it I also got a smart plug, so now when I walk up the stairs I can turn on my bedside lamp!  Still learning so I am sure I will be even more amazed in the future.  Hummm, I might need one downstairs now for recipes :)"
"Not good for streaming. Annoying.When streaming in the browser, the Show's display goes to sleep in about 5 minutes which kills the stream. There's no way to disable the display sleep. Really hamstrings the performance of the device. Cannot recommend this device until Amazon corrects this glaring design flaw. Plus the endless tips at the bottom of the screen are beyond annoying. More of a billboard than a useful device. Amazon can fix all this with a software update. Very disappointing."
"Great for keeping in touch, but need more tech assistance.The jury is still out on this after gifting one to my elderly mother for Christmas. My siblings also bought one so they could communicate with her as they live out of state, and it seems like a great device for that, but they have not activated it as they both do not want to download their entire contact list to the app. We need to find out if there’s a way they can enter my mother’s phone /contact info only, otherwise these will most likely be returned."
"Fun tech.This is my first time with a tech product like this. I just got it for Christmas, and I am not currently using it to it's full capabilities (video call, smart home) and still playing around with it.  It does have some really cool features and can do way more than I expected. Sound quality is great for playing music. Setup was super easy.  But sometimes I feel that if asking a question I could get a better/faster answer if I googled it on my phone. I considered getting this for my older parents but decided it was too complicated for them and would cause a lot of headaches."
"Echo Show 8 is not like Echo Show 5.I assumed that when I was buying an Echo show product that they would be similar in how they operated.  I use my Echo Show 5 as a night stand clock.  I am able to customize the background, colors and fonts of the clock.  On the Echo Show 8 I am not able to customize anything.  The clock is stuck in the corner and is very small.  Another annoying feature on the Show 8 is the Alexa suggestions at the bottom of the screen.  I don't need those suggestions rotating all the time.  Please give the users some choices in customization like in the Echo Show 5."
"Fun &amp; helpful.So far so good...Even though I have Siri I never use it so getting used to having this in my kitchen will take awhile. I’ve been playing with it more &amp; more. Have listened to popular xmas songs, asked a few questions, take suggestions. I read that people were annoyed by that feature but unless I’m staring at the screen I don’t notice it &amp; it doesn’t bother me when I do look at it. Plus, it gives me ideas I’ve never thought of. The set up was quick &amp; easy"
"Echo 8.Finally, after delays, I got mine today. Very easy set up, I think because we already have Alexa and smartness. However, so much potential going to waste I have to be negative. EX: screen brightness must be manually controlled. Weak. Then I’m stuck with the size of the clock feature! Come on, my eyes are weak, I need a strong device. Alexa, make the clock bigger. Not even a manual option for that! Haven’t tried other features yet but I see the potential!"
Great device.I am impressed with the echo show 8. I bought the echo show 5 and it was a great device and worked flawlessly except for one problem..the sound was pitiful. The show 8 is fantastic and the sound isn't earth shattering but its sound quality is really nice and is good for listening to music. It has some bass and doesn't sound distorted at max volume but fans of bass heavy music may find it disappointing. The microphones hear me easily when I say the wake word while playing music. I hot the show 8 on sale for$100 and its an even better deal for the lowered price of $100
"Helpful in life.Great product! I never thought I’d really use this till I bought one.You can ask her to remind you of something like write a check or your pets meds.I use the timer often. Alexa, set laundry timer for 50 min.So easy.Video calling is pretty neat too.The sound quality on music play is great.So much this can help you with.Ring users, ask Alexa to show you the ring.Boom! It’s on the screen.Great item."
"Great sound! Hours of Fun!I love the fact that I can watch YouTube videos on this, choose my photos on my phone, FB photos or Amazon photos to scroll on the screen. I also love the size of the screen &amp; the lyrics on the songs! My only complaint so far is it has a delayed response when I ask her a question or tell her to do something. My other Alexa’s don’t do that. I do enjoy all of the games she plays &amp; the new skills she offers! Loads of fun!Other than that, so far so good!"
"Not that impressed.Does not integrate with fire tv cube in same room well. Not the best at recognizing wake word. Have to use different command than cube. Ask for lyrics to a song, but only gives the first verse. Asked for song release date. Stated a  much later. The camera is angle so that if sitting at a table you have to place something under it to tilt camera down. Probably designed so you have to buy a expensive stand. Most of Alexa appearscto be getting dumber."
"Start up Good, Ongoing operation ??The initial integration into my Alexa system was great. Picture quality and sound exceeded expectations. Problems were finding/introducing skills and connecting with other services. I know this is not because of Echo 8, but if you can't figure out meaningful activities for it to do it really isn't any better than an Echo sound-only. Better instructions on finding/installing activities would greatly improve the Echo 8 value and my Overall Rating."
When it works it fun.The sound is a little hollow. Alexa doesn’t always know what we are asking for. I like the bigger screen. I listened to music most of the time. Talk radio and podcasts. For these items it works fine. But sometimes the directions have to be done 3 times to finally get it to work
Definitely a must-have.I have the first gen in the big 10 inch of this and I loved it so much. I have it in my kitchen I've had it for 2 years now. I wanted one for my bedroom and the 8in is the perfect size. Absolutely love these devices. I have one more on the way to place in my laundry room so that I can listen to music while folding my laundry or to video chat with someone that may call or ring my doorbell. I love the fact that I can drop in on any device throughout my home and check in with a camera. I highly recommend these to anyone who likes a smart home. I have it connected to my security system as well and all my echo dots throughout my home.
"Love this.I love this device. I used to have a google home and this is definitely an upgrade. I can watch the news every morning and check the weather, etc.I have now connected all my smart home devices with Alexa. I love how I can see my smart cameras on the screen of the echo. Very convenient. The speakers are real good as well! I now mainly use the echo for music as opposed to more expensive speaker systems. I would definitely recommend this."
Dishonest advertisement on Ech Show 8.Ordered Dec 27th as a Special offer with an Echo Dot included. There was a choice for color only. Received the Show 8 without the Dot that was in the offer.  I called customer service and was told there was supposed to be an option that should have been chosen to receive the FREE Dot. There was no option. CS representative checked on a separate order also placed by my son at same time. His order also shows NO Free Dot.  Amazon advertised a Free Dot to be included with the purchase of the Echo Show 8 and did NOT follow through.
"Alexa, ""Show"" Me Some Stuff.I bought this as a Christmas gift for our family all to use. We are still learning all of its different functions and features but so far so good. I got the slate version and it's a very attractive device, much like the Google Nest Hubs. Really good sound playing music and it recognizes voices accurately. We already have an Echo so the two can work in tandem. I've streamed a movie on Prime while cooking in the kitchen and it accomplished that beautifully. Also a great buy, since I got it during the Black Friday deals so it was discounted, even though just released. Recommended!"
Love it.This is awesome.  I love that you can just ask Alexa to play music and it differs.  You can adjust volume by speech as well.  Ther music shows lyrics for certain songs which is cool.  Great sound and picture quality.  The volume at 5 is sufficient and loud enough for me but I did turn it up just to check the sound.  I was not disappointed. I also used to look up a recipe which was excellent.  I can't wait to see what else I can do with this.
Learning more everyday.I have had Echo with Alexa for several years and have enjoyed them.  This one has the show that makes all the difference.  It shows you the words when playing the music with words.  Is shows recipes you want to find and holds them on screen while you follow the recipe. It connects to audible and reads to you.  It researches something you want to know and tells you about it. I am learning more everyday and I am thrilled with Echo Show 8!
"The stupid ""try"" ahem...feature!!I would like to tell you about sound quality, responsivness to voice commands, picture quality, build quality etc. BUT I CAN""T BECAUSE THERE IS NO WAY TO TURN OFF THE ANNOYING AND DISTRACTING ""TRY"" FEATURE COVERING UP MY PHOTOS!!! You would think Amazon would listen to the thousands of users searching desperately in every corner of that Interweb magical space thingy for a way to turn it off but I guess Amazon knows more about what we want more than we do. Total fail."
"Ring cam doesn’t prompt when doorbell is pressed.The shape reminds me of an old analog tv. The Alexa notifications at the bottom of the screen are really bad. It’d be nice if the screen automatically showed the front door ring cam when the doorbell was pressed, or zone that you want to watch, and could cycle through other cams while in standby. It should have the option to display a cam on the home screen at all times! Maybe it’s a skill I haven’t found, but seriously disappointed that integration isn’t there yet, and if it does, why isn’t it really easy to find?  That is the main disappointment in the first 24 hours."
"The Show 8 with so much visual capabilities is great !The Show 8 is a game changer for me. The visual skill reminders, lyrics to songs, picture quality etc.. is great.I own 4 Echo Dots and mine is now in my bathroom to listen to music while showering etc.I like it so much I bought one for my wife downstairs.I have been using them for home automation with great success. I am now experimenting with IFTTT.Utilitarian and entertainment fun !"
"Echo Show 8.I already had a Show 5 when I ordered the 8 and had found the 5 to be a great product.  When I received the 8, I found the performance to be on par with the Echo 5.  The sound is great and it is nice to have the topics pictured like for example the weather forecast, versus just having an oral description.  In addition, I have a Ring Pro doorbell and find the Echo's to be very helpful in seeing the door camera and in responding to UPS, USPS, and FedEx deliverymen.  I highly recommend the product."
"Don't like ads.After having the Alexa around for about two years, I was disappointed in the echo show. I don't like ads running on my screen, or voices to go along with the ads. I am pissed that Amazon takes a good idea and then uses it to spread garbage and unwanted ads on the screen. Shame on them! I was excited about having lyrics with my songs, and still be able to ask questions, and get the answers. That is great, but the ads suck, so I had to down grade the review this time. Sorry. : ("
"Disappointing sound and annoying Alexa “Try” suggestions.I bit on the offer to trade my first generation Echo for this. I have mixed feelings about doin this. Two things are just not great. First, the sound seems not as clear as the Echo—it’s muddier. Second, there is no way to stop it from constantly showing suggestions of what to try saying to Alexa along the bottom of the screen. One annoyance is that the Alexa iPhone app for setting which photos to show is clunky and limiting."
Don’t show me things I don’t care about.Don’t like the home screen stuff. Just want to see my wallpaper. Other than that works great.
"Continued Improvements.I have owned all iterations of the echo.  Amazon continues to improve the units. Near field works better, sound quality and video have also been improved.  Wife has the 5, but I liked a bigger screen and this fits the bill. I actually replaced a google nest with this and never looked back.  Google is still the king on ""googling"" random stuff but Amazon continues to improve. Integration with their ecosystem is seemless."
"Needs help.I had my expectations way to high. Nothing could ever live up to Echo 5. After the absolute failures of the Echo auto, buds, frames and loop I was really hoping for a winner. It doesn't even have the same skills as it's little sister. You can't put the date on the screen or make it into a proper clock. You can't darken the screen without telling her to turn off her screen. A real let down. Let's pray for some updates."
Decent screen not many options no alexa app for show.It's nice to have a screen to look at when u ask for weather and news but it doesn't work with alexa app so it's a lot harder to set up even tho u have a screen to look at during set up. And surprisingly the screen doesn't have many options to use with it mostly cameras everything u can do with an echo and TV. I'd of thought the screen would of had more options. It's nice but not what I expected. Guess it's cheaper than portal lol if u want to video chat with fam but it'd harder to use than an echo and does half the things echo does. Id say good for kitchen stuff over bedroom. It's nice to wake up to a clock and weather but I'm sure cheaper options for just that. In kitchen u can look up recipes and make shopping list or order products.
Lots of features but watch what you say.Super upgrade from my DOT. Easy to set up. Integrated easily with my Blink home security. Show me the front door..etc. i like the ability to physically block the camera. I dont fully trust Alex because it monitors everything you say. I believe if I talk zbout buyi g a new goat milker I will start recieving ads for one. Very happy with the video calling feature. Grandparents dont have to try video calls on cellphones.
Alexia with a tiny unchangeable clock!I really did not need a photo display device. Or another dot. I needed an integrated device with a large clock face so I can see the time when my glasses are off at night. A .75 inch clock -really Amazon? Do you think this product will succeed without a basic proper clock? Google has implemented their product 100 percent better. Please update the clock functionality to assist your visually challenged customers-PLEASE!
"Pretty Cool.When I first got it, I asked who the 26th president was? Alexa responded ""Teddy Weirdo"" laughed about it told some friends who got the same answer, now it's corrected to Teddy Roosevelt, so they do pay attention apparently... Still trying to find some ""Light Almond"" colored smart switches to work with it. bought one for my mother in law,so we can ""drop in on her, haven't set it up yet, as it's a Chriatmas present..."
"still learning.Y0u can go online and research its capabilities.  You can play with the screen, but if you really want to learn anything and how to make the most out of this item - order the how to book.  I also bought one of these for an elderly aunt  to help me stay in touch and physically see her and the only way this will work is to provide actual written instructions.  One so I can see it and two so I can help here reference particular pages and paragraphs."
"Great size and great quality!I like the Echo so much! Just ask for music and you’ve got it!! It is big enough to use in the kitchen to follow recipes, watch movies and view pics. I like the ability to close the camera shutter and to turn off the mic when I want to. I play games with Alexa too.  You can also ask Alexa what was the last thing recorded and erase it!  I asked Santa for the smaller echo and a smart plug for Xmas!  So far I’m very pleased😃"
"Nice tool.I like the Echo Show. I find it does a lot more than I expected, in some cases. In others, it seems limited. I can ask it to do things that I had recently asked for without problem, but then it will not show me. It just stays on the home page. It can be confusing and I’m not sure if it’s me or the echo. Otherwise, the sound is excellent. The picture is beautiful. I enjoy using it for fun and when I need assistance."
"""Try 'Alexa...'"" No thank you.This would be a great device if it didn't have the annoying Try Alexa hints on screen with no ability to turn it off. I've had Alexa devices for several years now, and I don't need additional suggestions on how to integrate Alexa more into my daily life. I'm contemplating returning the device, I find it so annoying. To me it borders on advertising, and I don't want a device that shows advertising with no way to opt out.On the upside, I did figure out how to integrate with my Ubiquiti cameras so that's been nice."
Superior To Google Hub.Everything is great and far more superior voice recognition over Google Hub but you definitely have to place it on the stand so it doesn't muffle the sound. Whoever thought it was a good idea to place a speaker on the bottom should be demoted.
"Not Enabled for Show and Tell Feature.This is the second Echo Show device that we purchased. First the Echo 5 and now the Echo 8. In each case I was told that the ""show and tell"" feature for the blind was enabled. (""Alexa,What am I holding"") Not So. Be careful to verify the generation for the product that has this feature and unfortunately the Service team at Amazon is not familiar with the feature and prone to faulty and incorrect advice."
"Interface &amp; App Offerings Need Work.I like the Echo Show 8, but I find the interface clunky compared to the Cube and Fire TV Stick.  For instance, if I ask it to adjust the lights while watching a video, the light control screen comes up, and you have to start from the home screen to get back to your video.  Also, I can't seem to control the brightness of the screen by routine or voice command.  The lack of certain video services like Disney+ and Netflix is a definite drawback.  Its a new-ish product, and I have faith that Amazon will make improvements as it did with its other Echo products."
"Overall, it does what I want it to.I like it shows the video from my doorbell cam on command. It can drive me crazy sometimes when Alexa misunderstands me and gives me wrong info I didn't ask for or want. I've also noticed recently that sometimes it has trouble communicating with my other devices, like smart plugs, though half the time the other device responds anyway. Still, I'm glad of the reminders from my calendar, etc., to keep me on track."
"The goldilocks echo! Not too big, not too small, great sound.I have 3 shows now. The 1st &amp; 2nd gen and now the 8. I love it! The screen is larger than the 1st gen and just a little smaller than the second. For the cost this is a great choice if you are trying to decide which is right for you. It sounds great. The screen is decent size to see photos on and is large enough to read the info I have set up for Alexa to show me throughout the day. I wanted another device to be able to add one in my art studio. The echo 8 delivered big! I would recommend and have bought some as gifts. IMO this is the “baby bear” echo, it’s size is just right. Doesn’t take up too much room yet has a screen large enough to see from anywhere within the room. Job well done 👍 👍"
"Alexa is hard of hearing!!!It's a great product when Alexa can understand you, Amazon has some bugs to work out on it. ☹"
"NO SCROLLING ALEXA SKILLS.I have two dots and just ordered a second one of these Echo Show 8. I love mine. Does everything I need and more. If you look at the picture you can see I do not have the Alexa skills. I am a 65 year old grandma and I figured out how to stop the ""ads"" as a bunch of you are calling them. They are not ads but anyway. Read the material. If you can't turn it off, face it, it's you not the device.Easy peasy!"
"Ups my Alexa Game Big Time!This is my first Alexa Show device, and I am HAPPY. It is so much more interactive and helpful than my Echo Dots. Everything it does is more intuitive and helpful beyond the mere limits of voice interaction. With its unintrusive suggestions of topics and things to try, it helps me realize that there are helpful, interesting things to try. So the performance is good, the pleasure of using it is easy, and I'm happy I got it."
"great quality sound, so easy to set up and use.This little device is outstanding. Set it up in about a minute and a half and I am tech. challenged. The sound quality is really fantastic. The screen suggests different Alexa skills that are not only fun but useful - device is solid and not flimsy - great screen quality. Since I do have prime streaming the selections are endless. I do not have prime music, but if you do the music selection is even broader."
Alexa devices.The alexa show 8 and all alexa devices still have an issue. They allow you to create a group so you do not have to get specific with device names but this is not true. You still have to get specfic with device names or other alexa devices will still try to control other devices. Also im not so sure when someone video calls you through the alexa device and it rings your devices and your phone is a good idea..
Display/Sound/Camera great BUT two things are garbage.The sound is great and the screen quality &amp; camera are as well.Two things that I do not like about it:1. You can’t adjust the font size of the clock. Why not? I’d love to adjust the size of the clock and move the clock around.2. The “Try Alexa” ads are pretty annoying
"Almost perfect.I haven't explored all the features, but have my Home screen using slideshow of my Amazon photos. Also, have the time and temperature showing in the upper left corner. Enjoy playing music with the lyrics showing, and questions and answers being shown. Screen is easy to see, and home screen can be customized in several ways. I thought about the 10-inch Show, but got this on sale and haven't regretted it."
So easy to set up and use.I love this. Works great and it was so easy to set up. Screen quality is awesome and easy to hear. I bought this for my kitchen and I have my pictures as the background. I love walking out to the kitchen and seeing my photos on display. I tried the find a recipe and it displayed several recipes for what I asked. Also love hearing my music and seeing the lyrics. Works seamlessly with my other Alexa products.
"Stops the Try's!!!!!!!It looks good, and seems like it could be real nice, but Amazon needs a way to disable to TRYs!  If they finally realize they should listen to their customers, I think this will take off. For me, I won't get another until Amazon grows up and listens to the adults."
I bought three of them.I am hoping that they come out with a camera system that allows local storage for these units. As of yet they have you over the barrel paying for the cloud storage which is crap. I like them because the wife can quick look up recipes and these display our family pictures. I also built outside sockets in five zones to turn on and off our Christmas display in the winter and no more messing with timers. There are a lot of possibilities here with these units if Amazon doesn't get any more greedy. Time will tell.
"Echo Show 8 - Still new.So it has been a learning curve.  I only had an Alexa echo dot until now.  My sister has a older model as does my 80+ yr old mom.  We have figured out how to call each other but are still in learning mode.  If anyone has some tips, please share.  The sound quality on the 8 is really good for music and news but there seems to be a delay in the calls sound.  Also, sometimes my echo dot wants to answer and not the show.  I ended the communication for the dot but it seems to revert back.  Again still learning."
"Great... except for...I like everything about this except for the Alexa ""Try this.... "" recommendations that are on the screen.  Everyone is complaining about this and am completely surprised that Amazon has yet to resolve this issue and make it an option that can be removed.  I still recommend it.  Screen is very crisp and user interface is great.  One star deduction forced recommendations that are always on the screen."
"I LOVE MY SHOW 8!!! ❤🧡💛💚💙💜🤎.I like just about everything about my Show 8!! I'm just waiting for her to be compostable with AT&amp;T s.o I Vaughn use her with my Direct TV! She's AWESOME!! I also have her little sisters, Show 5 &amp; Echo Dot! LOL ... I love my adopted Alexa Family!! I'm still keyboarding all the cool things she can do with and for me. Great with the grandkids too ... she'll keep them busy with various games and she'll call their cousins too for video chats!!"
"Works beautifully - the setup is not as intuitive.Overall, we are very pleased with the Echo Show and its ability to connect with other Alexa products in the house and with our Ring doorbell. We love the feature of being able to call other devices in the household. Set up was not that intuitive and we had to go on line to find videos to instruct us on how to use the Alexa app to connect us to Ring doorbell and to the other devices. Just a heads up but nothing that should deter you from purchasing this product. Once it's working, it's a great product!"
"What is not to like!I have many Alexa devices - Echo, Dot, Spot, Echo Show 5 and now this one and have to say it is the best yet. Sound is good, size is perfect for watching movies or calls. It keeps track of all my reminders and appointments. I keep it on my desk displaying the time and temperature so I can see it all the time. Extremely easy to use. I do recommend buying a stand for it - I bought a non Amazon one that tilts and swivels and love it!"
"Nice Addition to the Alexa Family, but limited.Pro's: great picture, quality sound, easy setup, fits neatly anywhere with or without the moveable base. Con's: very limited access to popular apps that stream movies or T.V., difficult to return to movies after pausing (you're better off touching the screen); Doesn't allow you to download apps like a tablet.  Overall it's a great product, but needs an evolution push, which I hope is in the works."
"Awesome! Love it!I read a lot of negative reviews and was nervous buying this. They are wrong. Everyone is upset about the things rotating on the screen. You can stop this, you can customize what shows up, etc. I have helpful things like the weather or which of my teams won (or lost) rotate on my screen.The video is good and the sound quality is surprisingly awesome.My literal only complaint is that you can’t add apps. For example I wish I could add Netflix but I can’t seem to figure out how to.Overall wonderful. I would, and probably will, buy more."
"Much better than I expected.I was worried that the sound in the Show 8 would be like the old dots were.  It's really much better and clear.  Perfect match with our Ring Doorbells and Blue Iris security cameras.  Bought another one just for the Kitchen/Bar area.  ""Alexa, ask the bartender to make a ######.""  You instantly get the instructions with pictures and videos on how to make any drink ever created.  Recipes for cooking are the same.  Love this thing."
"GREAT EXCEPT.... Those dang ""Try Alexa....."".Man this is a great speaker, but honestly the fact that you CANNOT disable the ""Try Alexa, play the podcast, or show me a recipe"" on these devices makes me LOVE my Google Home screen so much better. It doesnt tell you to try alexa on top of every picture. I believe this is subliminal messaging that Amazon is using to try to get people to USE Alexa more, by forcing them to literally always think about it whenever they look at the display, which is ALL THE TIME...Please Amazon, I know you have so much money you could probably give these away just so people will be a part of your ecosystem, BUT for those of us that paid money for these please allow us to disable this TRY ALEXA nonsense that really clutters the screen, which is the main reason people by this over a standard ECHO etc.Thank you SO MUCH for listening Jeff!!!!We couldn't do this without ya!"
Much cooler than you'd think.This is much cooler than I expected. The size is ideal. I like that you can have your recipes up control all your connected devices and that it gives you snapshots of news stories and weather update. Here the weather changes so frequently that's really nice. My daughter would like to hijack it. She makes sure our grocery list has everything and is always changing the color of all the light bulbs
"Our Third Echo Product.This is our third (original echo + 2nd gen dot) echo product from home. We have it in our kitchen and is wonderful for looking up recipes, listening to music, news, etc.Few things that would be nice:- option to shuffle photos when they are used  as wallpaper- option to turn off Alexa skills tip at the bottom of the home screen- option to show 3 or 5 day weather forecast on the home screen- make the clock bigger on the home screen- app for YouTube TV"
Love seeing great-grandchildren.This was a gift from my grandchildren to this 80-year old.  The only feature I've loved so far is being able to see my great-grandchildren in their homes.  I haven't learned anything else and may be too old to learn.  My grandchildren live hundreds of miles away so are not available to help me figure this thing out.  I have to take the time after the holidays to go through all th tips my grandson left for me.
"Beware - received a used unit (already registered and dead pixels).Ordered as a Christmas gift.  Package was pristine - everything in original packaging.  When we were setting the unit up it came up with a screen showing it was already registered to someone else.  Then noticed two dead pixels.  This was obviously returned as defective, repackaged and sold as new.  To add insult to injury, spent over two hours with Amazon customer service trying to get resolved.  Transferred to six different people and got cutoff.Completely unsatisfied with Amazon’s customer service on this.Carefully inspect your device."
"Impractical, but kinda neat I suppose...Overall it's pretty decent I guess, it has really good sound quality and deep bass, but it's mostly just good for that! The picture quality is decent but you can just use your phone for voice calls, it's really hard to review as to it's far from a necessity or even practical. If you have the extra cash and already have Amazon devices then go for it!Votes are appreciated..."
"Perfect screen size and sound quality but annoying scrolling tips.I love the sound and picture quality and the screen size is perfect. However, the Alexa “try” tips on the bottom is quite annoying. I’ve managed to reduce the amount but can’t get rid of them completely. Also, when dropping in; whoever I’m dropping in on can hear me but I can’t hear them. I’ve tried this a few different times and unsure how to fix. It picks up my “Alexa” requests just fine so I know the microphone works."
"Worth it.A lot more fun than the dot. Screen rolls with interesting tidbits from current news to music suggestions to recipes to just about anything. You can play your photos , watch prime etc. Had the dot toothed to a Bose speaker but no need with the show. The sound quality is excellent. Even great bass response. Bigger is always better but can figure out why the 10 is so much higher the n the 8$."
NO Full Screen Clock !!What the **$*&amp;&amp;$ why is there not a full screen clock !!!
"Great device, great integration and worth every penny!Love the Echo Show!  I have the 5 and 8 inch  the 8 inch is worth the extra money for the larger screen.  Easy to setup and great integration with Ring.  It would be nice if Amazon would allow additional or customizable names for the device call out.  There are 4 today witch is helpful but for a smart home with many devices it is a little difficult when you say “Alexa” and a device a floor away answers up!"
"It’s ok.  Not blown away though.It’s nice and it works - but I find the interface limiting and a little confusing.  I thought it would do more but for what it is but I guess my expectations were too high. It just seems to take up more space and oh yeah, it has a screen.  Honestly I don’t use it nearly as much as I thought I would.  I have five echo devices running in my home and I’m used to using them without a screen."
Great product and reasonably priced.  Works perfectly with additional units purchased.I was impressed with the sharpness of the screen and being able to integrate this unit with the other units I own.  The sound is very good but not as good as the 10.1 inch unit which I also own.  Amazon has done a great job in creating a system that is fully integrated and works together with other units flawlessly.  I would highly recommend purchasing this and other units sold byAmazon.
"REALLY Fail to understand Why ALL the ""SHOW"" Devices Don't have the Same Features &amp; Abilities !I DON'T Like ""Show 8"" lack of Functionality !I REALLY Fail to understand Why ALL the ""SHOW""Devices Don't have the Same Features &amp; Abilities !Sure Seems like a No-Brainer to Develop ONEOperating System &amp; NOT have Different Development Teams Who Apparently Don't TALKto Each Other !I'd call that Down Right STUPID which Amazon typically is Not !LesB"
"Does not show Ring motion life views automatically.I bought this to show my Ring doorbell life view automatically when motion / ring is detected. Impossible to do that. Both products are from Amazon, but not working together as they should.You always need to say ""Alexa, show front door"" or whatever. 0 points. Mission NOT accomplished. I have about a dozen Echos and 9 Rings and the simplest thing is not possible to integrate... Sad Amazon..."
Works exactly as advertised.Works excellent with our Ring doorbell. Screen resolution is beautiful. One of our favorite purchases
"Great sound quality and excellent audio/video.I was very impressed by this unit. We have a fire cube, echo plus and several echos. This unit is by far the most versatile and user friendly of all units. The screen is surprisingly great quality and the sound is close in comparison to the echo plus. I’m glad I eith with the 8” screen over the 5”. It does a great job quickly linking to cameras and the rest of our smart home devices."
Love My Echo Show 8.I am really enjoying my Echo Show 8.  Love being able to view security camera on it and playing music..plus all the other stuff you can do.  .  The speakers are great.  I never expected it to sound as good as it does.  I have read where people complain about the suggestions at the bottom....they do not bother me at all.  In fact I like the suggestions.  In my opinion Echo Show 8 beats Google hands down.
"Can’t Turn Off Ads.Can’t turn off “Things to Try” ad on the bottom of the screen. I’ll keep it, to avoid the bother of returning, but would not purchase it again, and definitely don’t recommend. It’s basically a glorified slideshow frame, which is ruined by the constant ads for Alexa Skills running across the bottom."
Sound quality is bad.The Echo Show 8 is like a Fire table but fatter.  I'm not impressed by anything so far.  My Echo Dot picks up my voice better than the Echo Show 8.  I think the audio and microphone issues is due to the fact that there is no stand (but this is just my guess).
"My husband and I love this thing!We bought an Echo a couple of years ago, and then bought 3 of the Echo Dots. To be honest, we thought they were all okay, but we were never that impressed. However, the Echo Show is so much better! We both enjoy the visuals; they add a lot to the experience. Nice to actually see our grocery list or check out a cooking video. We’re definitely using it a lot more than we did before."
"Great device!I absolutely love this!  I know its only been a week, but this device is really nice!  I can bring up recipes, watch the news, play music, and so much more.. I have the device in my kitchen and everyone uses it in the family.  The ask Alexa suggestions that scroll across the bottom really don't bother me.  When the device is in use they do not scroll across.  The sound is also great in my kitchen! I am really happy with this so far!"
"love it.as with all amazons echo this is so dam great...i now have 5 and this one is my favorite.....when playing music is gives you the lyrics witch i use and i still haven't gotten into alot of what is does but the sound quality is awesome....i have my phone app with pictures activated so i get a to see those....i totally recommend this..i was going to buy the 5"" but i am glad i bought the 8"""
"Love/hate relationship.I love having this product but I still find myself going in endless circles with Alexia. Many times I feel like I am asking her very simple questions and she has a hard time answering, or doesn’t have an answer at all.The video and sound quality is excellent! I upgraded because I wanted an echo with a screen, and I’m never turning back. Def. worth paying the extra money."
"Great Sound and Picture!I listen to old time radio to go to sleep at night.  A lot of these old shows don't have the best sound quality and it can be difficult to understand what's being said.  With the sound system in the Echo 8 and the ability to adjust the base and treble, I now have no problem picking up every word.  To my surprise, I also learned I could watch my Amazon Prime movie and TV selections on the Echo 8.  The clarity of the picture is exceptionally good.  Thank you Echo for an amazing product.  I'll be getting the even larger one for my kitchen, soon."
"Very good but not perfect.Sound and video quality are excellent and it is the right size for sitting on the desk.  But some features are still missing.  No RDS is provided when listening to radio stations on the internet, thus no way to know what is playing.  Amazon should introduce direct DLNA support, as the few apps that offer support do not work well.  And why can't the Echo Show display maps when asked for directions?"
"disappointed with the quality.I like Alexa and have a few echo dots. I decided to try the show since it was on sale. Everything about Alexa integration works fine. Speaker is ok. But I quickly got disappointed with the terrible backlight bleeding. It is clearly a quality control issue here. Also, the screen isn't as responsive as I hope. Runs like a cheap Android tablet. laggy."
"Basically, junk.I've turned off discovery suggestions, they remain on the screen.  I've turned off rotate content, it still rotates.  The clock remains smaller than 2 inches.I'm just frustrated that suggestions are taking up more screen than THE ACTUAL CLOCK.I can't recommend this over the show 5, or a simple dot at the moment.  Maybe an update will fix this dumbest of smart devices in the future."
"Show and tell feature no longer works!I would have given this 5 stars but for one problem!  I bought this specifically because I wanted the show and tell feature because i am blind.  I am now being told that this feature has been removed and there's no reason why and not sure if it's going to come back.  I have been given such misinformation when I call Amazon's cucstomer support.  one person tells me it works on the 5-8-10 then i'm told it only works on the 10, and now being told it only works on the first and second gen, and lastly that it's been removed from all show devices.  I did all my research before I bought this product and even found videos on YouTube showing the echo show 8 with this feature enabled.  I'm so confused and frustrated!  I don't know whether I should just return this or wait and hope the next update  of software gets this feature back"
"Spectrum Link for NBC App does not Launch.Just got my brand new Show 8.  Tried linking the NBC app to Spectrum and it doesn't do a thing when you press it whereas ATT, Dish launch a sign in page.  Anyone else have this problem?"
"Adds the height &amp; tilt I needed but no screen rotation.I wish I had shopped around a little more before purchasing this.  It does add height, the ability to tilt the screen,  and a little more completeness to its posture, but it would be nice to have where I could turn the screen a bit.  It fits perfectly &amp; is held in place magnetically.  The tilt is great, the ability to rotate the screen even a little would make it perfect."
"Echo Show 8 is Very Good.I’ve wanted to try an Echo Show &amp; this was on sale for Christmas. It came with a free Echo Dot. It was easy to setup &amp; add to the other Echo products I already have &amp; link to my SmartThings Hub. I’m very satisfied with it so far, although the sound quality isn’t top notch, but it’s better than the Dot’s or the original Echo I have, so I’m very satisfied with my purchase."
"horrible camera angle.you can't adjust camera angle unless you prop something under it, you have to stand up  just to see your face, the adjustable mount is another$30, horrible price for a piece of plastic that should be included!  device is excellent, just a rip off to make you buy and adjustable stand! will return for this reason and buy google home device! Amazon ruined this great device!"
"""Things to try"" makes this a FAILURE.The screen constantly shows things to try on the bottom of the home screen. This can't be turned off. I know everything it can do since my I have had an echo for years and years. I don't need this message spit in my face every time I look at the screen. I would NOT recommend this product and may just send it back for this reason. Buy the google one you'll be much happier"
"Very nice display and decent sound.How you plan on using the Echo Show 8 may determine whether you like the screen size or not. This is a perfect size for the kitchen and someone who uses it for recipes and actually viewing or reading information. But... If you plan on using it for a bedside clock and information screen, it might be a little too big. Go with the 5. Overall, I really enjoy these smart speakers."
"Size does matter!I owned an echo show before, the thinner one and loved it as an alarm clock.  It bothered me that the pictures I stream in the background were cropped.  This solves that issue.  It is a little bright for an alarm clock according to my wife, but other than that we love it.  It is big enough to actually watch shows or movies on it bedside.  The audio could use a little more quality."
Super fun.My husband got me this as a early Christmas gift he loved it so much and was like she might just buy this herself lol I do love it. The sounds are great it looks up everything so far and reminds me to have a great day.
So far so good.I docked 1 star because I feel like there should be more video type skills to add to your Show.  I also think that its greatly missing a feature of casting or sending webpages to your show from your phone.  My wife wanted to use a recipe that she found on her phone and was unable to figure out how to get it on the show.  Overall the device is great and we like having it.
"Nice addition to the kitchen!I haven’t had the Echo Show 8 very long but in the short time I’ve had it I love it. It looks great in the kitchen especially with the slideshow of photos that I have on Amazon photos. I turned off most of the features that it came with such as frequently updating the news as the display was too busy for my taste. So far I have used it mostly to listen to music, which sounds very good, but soon I intend to do a few recipe trials.  For me the 8” screen is perfect in its location."
"Could be awesome.UPDATE Jan. 2020: the ""Try"" messages can now be removed!  *Happy dance* Increased my rating to 4 stars.  Native support for YouTube &amp; clock customizations would make it 5.Just the right size.  Missing YouTube functionality.  Alexa ""Try"" messaging constantly displaying over my photos - keeping it as an act of faith that Amazon will rectify this sooner or later."
"Great Sound &amp; Video Features, Plus Easy Setup.Came pre-setup to my Amazon account &amp; Wi-Fi.  Love the nature background screens &amp; the ability to see album covers of what music is playing.  Internal speakers sound good.  plugged into our Bose Radio via audio cable sounds even better.  Do Note: unlike the Echo Dot 3, the Bluetooth capability is only for ""in"" signals, such as from your  cell phone.  Still exploring other features."
"Sounds great.Yes, I can listen to my iPod Touch using Bluetooth so that makes me happy.  The Alexa tips at the bottom are annoying.  I changed settings and unplugged it.  That worked for a while but then the suggestions returned.  I need to buy some smart plugs.  I had trouble getting it to recognize my voice using the app on my phone but it worked using the device.  The sound quality is excellent."
"Close to expectations.The SHOW 8 works well, but I agree with a lot of the reviews, I hate the ""Try Alexa"" at the bottom of the screen and then more words regarding the ""try"" on the middle of the screen. We need a fix to this. Also a little miffed that when I paired to a bluetooth speaker the SHOW speakers quit while bluetooth speaker plays. Would have been great to have both at the same time. Overall pleased."
Dont LIsten to Try Alexa Compliant Reviews.I love this item. It does everything you would want. It has Alexa Integration. It has prime video and prime music. You have a Ring doorbell? It works with that too. People giving it 1 or 2 star reviews only because it has a Try Alexa message are being nit picky at best. You can make it so it only shows up on the home screen. People make it seem likes its always on display even while watching prime video or watching Ring Doorbell footage. It's not. It isn't a deal breaker for me and it shouldn't be for you either. Get this device. You wont regret it.
"It looks &amp; sounds better than I expected.It looks &amp; sounds better than I expected.  But its sound has a little too much bass &amp; not enough treble, even with its bass turned down all the way &amp; its treble turned up all the way.  And if there was a model with about a 10"" screen that didn't cost more than $50 more, I would have bought it.  But overall I like it much better than my second generation Echo Dots!"
"FABULOUS.I LOVE my Alexas &amp; Echo. Yes, I now have three so beware, they are addictive. We live at the bottom of a large hill &amp; get terrible reception on all the radios I’ve ever tried. I can get my radio stations on Alexa/Echo &amp; the sound is beautiful, especially on Echo Show 8. My grandson stopped over &amp; set up Alexa to turn on our bedroom light. More new toys/securities!"
"Exactly why does this have a screen again?OK, so you have a device with a touchscreen that only runs skills built for Echo devices without a screen. The screen apparently is just used for a clock. How exactly is this useful again? My wife was very disappointed with her Christmas present, which will we shortly be on its way back to Amazon. Seriously, we don't expect much here, just for this thing to be able to run a simple cookbook app from the Fire store. They can't even get that right."
"Best choice by far among the 5, 8, &amp; 10!!After much research, I chose the 8 over the 5 and 10. The speakers are just as good as the 10 and that’s what I care the most about! Also, the display is just as good as the 10. The only difference between the 8 and 10 is that the 10 has a better camera, which I never plan on using. And if I do video chat, the quality is not worth the extra $100 price difference."
"Echo show 8.I've been satisfied so far, whisper recognition how cool is that, being considerate of others, big screen to show what you want to have alexa show, down fall, the screen does not sleep when in idle or no option, when you want the room dark, I regret not getting the adjustable stand, it would have come in handy, I'd recommend this product we are having fun with it, more to learn."
"Alexa gets even better.I have only had this for a few days, but I love it. Matching visual with Alexa's voice is so much better. I love that it accesses my Ring doorbell fairly fast. It shows lyrics when playing music. I can talk to my daughter, (who is 2 states away) face-to-face with ease. I can see the weather forecast as well as hear it. I'm excited to find out what else I can do."
"Worth the money!I ordered this after loving the basic echo dots. We have 6 throughout our home and use them daily if not hourly. The show really is worth the extra money and counter space. I’m sure we are only using a fraction of what the Show is capable of, and can’t wait to discover more. Easy to use for kids (6 and 8) and adults. The best part is the photo background. Everyone is always looking and talking about the new pictures that popped up. Definitely worth it!"
"Show 8.Love it.Although the description on these says you can play videos on this it's only Amazon Prime videos and Hulu.So you are looking at paying out additional money for subscriptions to these sevices. Also I thought it would be nice for Netflix videos and Youtube Videos and I already have subscriptions for these, but forget it because it won't play them."
Que delución me lleve con amazon.Este pedido yo lo pedí en diciembre y traía la cámara junta con la echo 8 y lo que hicieron fue que como no tenían el echo 8 en el momento me comieron como que lo tenían más varato y resultó que me cojieron con el mandaron la cámara primero para cobrar la y servicio al cliente me vino con que la cámara yo la pedí separada y eso está mal de ellos yo soy una cliente que les compró a ellos por mucho tiempo y no esperaba esto de amazon que de solución me e llevado de amazon
"Good smaller cousin to the bigger Echo Show.Sounds a little less full than the, well, full sized Echo but sounds a whole lot better than the Echo Spot it replaced.One quirk that is ANNOYING is if the physical camera button is activated, the unit disconnects from the ""everywhere"" group for my music.Other than that, it's great for my bedroom while its bigger cousin inhabits another larger room."
This is an amazing product.This 8 inch Echo is absolutely amazing I previously had the 5 inch and I must say this one is far and away 10 times better due to its size don’t waste your time getting the smaller one just go for the big boy.
"Large screen with good sound.This show has a large screen, in fact larger than I anticipated, which is not a bad thing. Since my spouse is handicapped she answers the ring doorbell and accesses our Arlo cameras through Alexa. I am pleased and got it on sale to boot! It goes to sleep when there is no movement and low light. I don’t really watch movies but I think it has a large enough screen for that."
"Great Purchase, I’m Impressed!!!!I got an Echo Show 8 and the RING 2 Doorbell/Echo Show 5 deals for Black Friday, and have been impressed with all 3 items!  Both Echo Show devices have much better sound quality than the Echo Dots that I already owned, and the Dot has pretty good sound.  The Echo Show 8 elevates the sound quality of music, and has much deeper bass because of the speaker size.  The picture quality is great, I often have Hulu playing in it while folding clothes.  Great picture quality when I ask to see the camera from the Ring!  I often read reviews about Amazon ads on Echo Show devices, and I haven’t experienced a single one!"
"Try feature sucks.It is too bad that Amazon would ruin an okay product by making it impossible to stop the stupid ""Try"" suggestions on the home screen.  ""Try:  How do I make meatballs?  Try: Play Hungarian folk music.  Try: How do I live in a cardboard box under the freeway?""Try: How do I return an item because Amazon wants to control the minds of their customers?"
"Worth the extra $$.Had to return an echo show5 and replaced it with this. This is sooooo much better than the show 5, defenitely worth the little extra $$. Has good sound, great microphone sensitivity, larger screen makes it easier to navigate through skills and recepies. I love this thing, if you are on the fence between this and the cheaper show 5, DEFINITELY get the show 8."
Loving the Show 8.This was a big upgrade for us from the Gen 1 Echo. So far we are loving it!  Was easy to set up and integrate with our Ring cameras which was the main reason for buying it.  Takes about three seconds to bring up the camera's witch is faster than viewing on the phone app or taking time to bring up on a computer. The sound quality is very good. In time we may replace all our Echo's with Show 8 units. The price was right for Christmas.
"Good AF.This device is great for listening to music, looking at photos, and controlling home devices. Its beautiful, in a techie sense, to look at, and it has a pretty good speaker. However, it does not have the same clock function as its smaller brother, which i kind of wanted. It does have the alarm though. So, overall, a great device to get instead of a plain alexa speaker."
"Good product, but bad UI and missing apps.I like the sound quality and screen on the device, but I have a lot of the same complaints as many others.The Things to Try suggestions can't be turned off despite what the top review says, the clock can't be made any bigger, and there aren't any apps for Netflix and YouTube. My Fire Stick has them, why doesn't this?All of this could be fixed with a software update, which is seriously needed."
"I like my echo dot as well as this.Works good,has a good picture and good sound .But as it has been said in many other reviews the the things to try constantly going across the screen gets very old,and I've only had it a few days.I guess I'll keep it but I'd just as soon have my echo dot as this at least you dont  get the things to try with it.If you could turn that off it be alot better ."
"ECHO SHOW.....getting used to it.I recently added the 8 inch Echo Show to my home accessories of 2 existing Echos, a dot and standard configuration.  I located the Show in our dinning nook so that we could see the camera coverage and also use it for timers, information and music. I had difficulty synching the show with my ARLO cameras but eventually got things working correctly.  Overall it is a fun device and I am still discovering what it can do.  It creeps out my wife a bit for she feels that not only can Alexa now hear us but also sees us."
"As usual, Amazon's lack of UX design is the low point of this device.The show is occasionally helpful, and once I managed to get my own photos as a background, enjoyable to see. However, 1) that's very hard to do and 2) It WILL NOT allow you to stop the continuous onslaught of ""Try... blah blah"" at the bottom of the screen.  I hate seeing those and I hate that their appearance (a movement) attracts my attention from whatever else I was doing. Similarly, the screen cycles through formats and photos pretty quickly and abruptly, again using motion to capture my attention. Really, I just want an attractive photo frame with the time, weather, and calendar events that responds when I talk to it."
"There are endless things that this device can do, and connect with!I am just beginning to use my new Echo Show which I received as a gift for Christmas. I enjoy all the features, and am still exploring what it can do. I love the photography /pictures on the slide show (I chose travel) I love that I can connect it with my other TV streaming choices, and enjoy listening daily to my news channels. The headline news , cooking ideas etc. are all a wonderful feature.I will add that Alexa is a joy to greet in the morning and in addition she is quite funny.Great product."
"Ok, but.Like it.One of the main selling points for me is that it says you can play videos.You can play videos but only Amazon Prime Videos and Hulu as long as you subscribe and pay for them.If your thinking Netflix Video and YouTube Video forget it, won't work.Which is too bad because I already have subscriptions I pay for for these."
"Product development managers, what are you thinking?Cannot make clock numbers larger. And cannot turn off the ""Ask Alexa"" suggestions rotating at bottom of home screen. Can't add personal email address. Did they not run this by a few focus groups? Their Product Managers must be idiots. RETURNING IT!"
Nice Upgrade From The Dots.We had Ecco Dots all over the house.  This is a definite sound upgrade. And the screen is very useful in the kitchen for cooking. We bought one for the office as well.  Great to have the screen for spelling and visual (analog) transfer of info when I don't want to close the browser on the computer.  The price will come down.  But it's a value anyway.
"Lives up to its Hype &amp; more thus Far!The Echo Show 8 is better than what I expected. It's well built, but the sound quality blows me away! It has a lot of bass for its size. It has integrated well with my Smart Home devices. I'm learning more each day of what this Echo 8 is capable of. It is fast on voice commands and I like the news &amp; suggestions it offers. My wife &amp; I really like it a lot!!"
Get you one.This unit is amazing! Playing music it on it is like having a sound bar or stereo system! The quality of sound is great! She works just as well as my dot but just with pictures. I love that you can customize the home screen with your own pictures. I ordered the sand but originally wanted the black but I really like the sand color. It looks nice in my family room
"Major winner in multiple languages and for all ages.Ours is in the kitchen and configured for Spanish/English (i.e., it listens in both and displays in Spanish). My fiance is 70 and English is not her first language but she took to it immediately. The day after we received it she was already listening to Central American internet radio stations. Half of what she used to do on an iPad she now does on this device (YouTube, recipes, vacation pictures, etc.). After simple config we have none of the ""Try"" issues that some here complain of.Two months ago I started by buying an Echo Dot for my home office/work bench with some smart plugs, then came a 4K Fire TV Cube for the den and smart switches for interior and backyard lights, next an Ecobee smart thermostat (Alexa built in), and she now wants an Echo Show-5 for the bedroom to use as an alarm clock and to control a smart fan and more lights."
"The microphone array could be better.The show integrates into my household wonderfully. The microphones on it are a not as receptive or sensitive as the echo dots. I find myself having to raise my voice even though there is very little ambient noise in the room. I have it three stars for this reason, four stars for everything else, it would have to serve my coffee for a five star review."
"Decent but still needs work.The video call function is great when it’s working and for short calls. Prolonged conversations tend to freeze. Good to call grandma on(don’t expect her to call you though).Voice recognition is about as good as any Alexa. It’s manageable if you use simple names and commands in a patient tone within 5 ft. Don’t expect star trek, its not there.Music is great. Sound coming out is clear and easily fills up my space.I dont take advantage of most videos because you have to use Vevo and it just doesn’t have the content."
"Didnt think I'd want it, now I love it!My husband insisted we buy this. I didnt see a need for it, but he preordered it anyway. Now, I absolutely love it! The weather forecast is visible and accurate. YouTube is accessible, web browsing is accessible, and all the other Alexa functions are available, as well. Still have a bunch of stuff I haven't tried yet. Makes the kitchen cheerful!"
"Perfect for keeping in touch with family.I bought one 8 and one 10 so my dad could get me without having to find his phone every time. He loves his 10 because the screen is big and he can listen to music as he cooks. He lives alone, so this will help me make sure he's good when I can't get over to see him in person. Linking them was not easy, but we figured it out. My brother will be getting one as well."
"No large clock option.I have many amazon devices, including the Echo Show 5.  Unlike that device, you CAN NOT display a large clock  on the Echo Show 8.  Nowhere is this listed on the web page!  As a software engineer myself, I do not understand why this isn't offered on this device despite the cries of 1000's on the internet asking for it to be on all of the Echo Show devices.  Please stop ignoring everybody.  Returning this."
Echo Show 8 works well...I've had the device for a week or so now. I was impressed with the build quality. Still trying to determine its appropriate uses in our kitchen. Will add Ring doorbell in the future. Screen looks great and has all the functionality of an Echo paired with a Fire tablet. Good purchase and would recommend as a great way to get into smart home on a budget.
Love it!I bought 2 of them. One for us and one for my parents. They LOVE it! And we love it! I like the recipe feature at lot. I just love seeing visual things. We use Alexa so much. We have another Alexa in the living room and sometimes we are talking to that one and the Show will pick us up instead or the other way around. That’s our only complaint.
"A smart piece of gadget to enjoy.The only problem I have until now is when Alexa does not play a song that I purchased from Amazon and it is listed on My Amazon Music Purchased .and My Library. I do not know why. I tried to talk slowly and clearly but it did not do the trick. Apart from this, I have found Alexa a friendly assistance.She never get offended.  Highly commended."
Try this phrases at bottom ruin the experience.I wish I could remove them. I've tried disabling as another reviewer has reported here and it just doesn't work. I use Alexa enough. I don't need to be reminded about what I can ask.
"In love.I love it. I have multiple sclerosis and this makes my life a lot easier. I can make calls, I can check the weather, I can turn my lights on and off, can see who’s at my door, I can set reminders to take my medicine and reminders for my doctors appointments, this has made my life so much easier. I can also send messages, I can also get recipes, I almost feel like this was made for me."
"Well worth the price.I purchased 8” Echo Show so I could see a larger screen for my Ring doorbell. It synced with no problems. The video screen is clean and crisp. I use it to play music, call my family and friends, and I can ask for all kinds of information and receive it so much faster than I can look it up. I loved it so much I also purchased the Dot for my bedroom."
Its good but not great.The device is great. Sound quality is awesome. The only thing I must complain about is the brightness. You have to turn the brightness up all the way to see any pictures or videos your watching. If you put it in the middle its very dim. Thinking about returning it. I gave it an overall rating of 3 stars. Would have been 5 if not for this flaw.
"The flagship is sinking.Got this item on sale and it is not worth the price the voice recognition on my 1999 flip phone was better and it 90% of the time still does not do what it is asked.  I will never buy another amazon exclusive product,  this the dot and the show5 I bought all suck and 3 different tech savvy people use them.  We all agree crap.  I have nothing good to say except the speaker sounds good for music on the eco show 5 &amp; 8, otherwise they are crap, very expensive speakers..."
"Great dev8ce.This Echo is almost perfect. The one issue I have with it is that it sometimes has selective hearing. I try to ""wake it up"" and it may or may not respond. I am not used to yelling to wake up my Alexa devices.I love the camera, especially the photobooth function. The pictures can be a little grainy. Filters would make it a little more fun."
"What a sound! Impressed!!!WHOA!!! The sound is so deep and crisp!!! With the type of music I listen too, indie pop, the Echo Show compliments the music so nicely! I’m not fussy when it comes to technology and this is worth it on all levels of experience and usability!! Simple, great sound, connected well with my Bluetooth... easy to set up, Bing bang boom, DONE!!"
"No Full Screen Clock.It weirdly doesn't support full screen clock, which is a deal breaker for me.If Amazon doesn't add this feature on the next software update, i'd return my unit."
"Touch screen is insensitive on inactive home screen, clock is always displays at the left corner.These reviews about how to disable ""Try Alexa"" reminder and making clock display larger and at the center, are misleading. I tried all kinds of setting combinations, the reminder still show up from time to time, the clock is always displayed at the upper left corner of the screen. However, there is a workaround === [enable the screen magnifier!]Another problem, the touch screen is very insensitive.  Overall, this product is very unsatisfying.  But I am keeping it for sake of Echo features (NOT the show features) and hoping the future  firmware upgrade can fix  all these annoying defects."
Good device... poor support.I just spent an hour on the phone with a rep that told me the only option was drop in and that you could not call another echo device. I thought that was stupid to allow other free access to your device. Once off I tried to just call and it works and they have to answer. I asked the rep specifically if you had an option to answer and was told no.
"Better than expected.Sound is better than expected, better than our original 1st gen Echo. We use it for recipes and all the other things we used original for. Adding screen makes quite a difference"
"Easy to Use and set up.I received this as a gift and had my doubts that two seniors to get it going and use it. Set up is simple as long as you know  your WiFi password.  After that Alexa walks you through it.  Alexa connects with our ring camera and shows us the image on request when it alerts. I’ve used it for recipes, the weather and just for fun with my grandchildren."
ALEXA I hear you.Just installed our ALEXA Show 8. It's good to see your family az well as listening to music etc.. The only thing that would make it better would be a wide angle lens. To view two or more people we must really squeeze together. It would be fantastic to have a choice between the standard lens or a wide angle lense.Get one for all your family members.
"Mostly good, but annoying text on screen.The device is overall great and is a wonderful idea overall because it combines a digital frame with an Echo.  The only complaint I have, which kept from giving it 5 stars is the annoying text that it displays telling me that Alexa can do this or that, which I don’t care for and for some reason Amazon doesn’t let me turn it off.  Maybe with an update they will and save everyone from being annoyed by this."
"Really nice.I got the Echo Show 8 because I liked my ES 5 so much. The 8 has a beautiful big display that's very clear and bright. The only thing that's not the best is the sound is a little bassy to my ear. I have a little trouble understanding Alexa sometimes but that could be because I'm older and getting slightly deaf. Otherwise, it's great."
"This was a gift.The most important use is just a reminder. Alexa reminds a person of every appointment and things that slip your mind. Alexa can do small things make a grocery list, make a phone call and remembers Birthdays, anniversary, and little things I have a habit of forgetting. Also the more you work with the Echo the more you discover what it can do. I hope others will share what they discover the Echo can do. I in a learning process at this time and it is interesting. Who knows what  you can accomplish with the Echo. PLease share yor knowledge."
"Better than a Analog TV!I love the sound quality,  the daily food and activities suggestions.  I love watching YouTube movies onit while I am cooking, and the clarity of Alexa's voice sounds like a Boise sound system.  I can hear Podcasts on it, I am amazed this little device has so many things to offer. I am still exploring it! So far! So Good!!!"
"Very disappointed ☹️.Frustrating device. The 5 is easier to set up and much more customizable as a clock. Cannot alter the clock display at all.  It will not set alarms to music, will not link to other Echos in house. CANNOT GET RID OF THE ‘Try, Alexa’ scroll at bottom of screen. VERY ANNOYING!!  Overall, extremely disappointed for the money spent."
"Super Show 8 - Make Sure to Update Firmware.This is a Great Amazon Product  Amazon has fixed the issue with the size of the time on the home screen in their latest update.  Make sure you check in settings to see if you have the latest update. Also most of the trash can be removed from the screen in settings, un-click everything you don't want to show on the screen."
"""Alexa - Give yourself 5 stars"".Kitchen has 8"" Show. I use it for recipes and music. TV room has 1st gen Echo ""Alexa turn on lights"". Bedroom has 5"" show which is a great night time clock and weather forecaster. Biggest use for our house is ""Alexa add milk to my shopping list"" then ""Alexa print my shopping list"". Grandkids won't give it a moments peace."
"Interaction.Similiar to my echo dot but with an added visual screen for much more intraction.  Told me I would recieve it on the 31st, yet after a short conversation with an Amazon rep, he expedited my order to the 24th ( the same day as the gift to my Sister so we can set it up together.  I'm really happy with this product and it keeps getting better!!!"
"Echo Show 8.Out of all the Echo Shows, this is the one I like the best, It is a good medium size and the picture quality is outstanding. I usually go with the sandstone color, but this has a ""frame"" of white around it. The dark would go much better with my furniture, so I ordered another one! I am pleased how easy it was to set-up."
"Nice picture and sound, just isn't very smart.Just like the original Echo, the voice instruction isn't very complete or good. The device cannot open a YouTube video from a voice prompt, for example. It cannot open a webpage on it's own unless you tell it to open Firefox first. Some things that it should be able to do easily, but can't:""Alexa, search Youtube for the most recent Linus Tech Tips video.""""Alexa, bring up CNN's webpage.""Can't do either."
"Show and Tell, Not!I bought this for the Show and Tell feature as I am visually impaired only to find out that feature isn't available on this device. Amazon continues to disappoint me."
Software could make this great.Wanted to love it. The Try quote always on the screen and the lack of customization forced me to return it! I can’t believe you cannot make the clock and weather full screen. I just want a background with the time and forecast that’s it. Anyways it’s up to amazon to update the software and that hasn’t proven to be anytime soon. Add more customization features and I’m on board. Until I can actually see the time and date on a huge screen instead of it tucked in the upper left corner I’ll pass
"Image Quality Is Terrific.First let me say that installation and setup were a breeze, given that I have other echo devices installed.  With the initial power-up, the device found the network name (SSID). I provided the password and that was it. I was up and running.  The first screen was bright and supper sharp as would be expected with a HD display.  I am thoroughly pleased with the device."
"It' is pretty.Going from the echo show 5 to the 8"" version is  disappointing. For example: It does not have multiple clock faces that the 5 inch version has. The setup screen is also different. It seems less modern in the 8 inch version. I expected the 8 inch version would have the sane operating system as the 5 inch but it doesn't. Too bad ."
"Our Echo Show.I doubt that we will ever use all the features embedded in our new Echo Show, but we are willing to try.  We love our Alexa and now want to experience the ability to make calls to our family face-to-face... it should be a fun experience for all of us.I have no idea how we ever lived without these great devices."
"Surprised by how much I love this!I've had a few older Echo devices but this was my first with a display. I had no idea how much better it would be. Opens up a whole new world of games, images, video, just everything. Responses to even the most basic of questions are at a whole new level, which makes me want to use it more. Best thing I bought for myself that I didn't know I needed."
"Definitely a must buy.My Partner and I had an Early Christmas. One of my gifts was the Echo Show 8. I Love this the sound quality, picture and voice recognition. I Love the fact that I can watch Prime Videos, Play music and watch Recipes on it. The only thing I can say it ""Just Buy It"". You will not be disappointed. Trust me! Once again, Thank you Amazon for an Amazing Product. The ""Try Alexa"" at the bottom is not annoying at all."
"Only an Alexa.Great screen, integrated with my Alexa home system, good sound.But cutesy! keeps on trying to get me to get weather in a foreign land or recite something cute. Great for asking definitions -- in fact anything you ask it that it can't do, it ""defines"". Try ""show browser"" - you'll get ""what is a browser"".It seems to keep selling its pet products. I wanted a recipe for a Pillsbury product and it kept giving me either stuff from ""All Recipes"" or ""Food network"".Actually it is what it says -- an Echo with a screen."
"Nice addition to my kitchen counter.I haven't used it to cook yet, but nice to have for watching a few shows while prepping food or doing the dishes. Sound quality isn't as good as the latest generation Echos, but is much better than the Dot it replaced. Having all the video skills such as Ring is a nice plus, but probably the nicest thing is being able to see my timers without having to ask alexa."
"Alexa8 Insane Clarity.Easy setup, insane resolution and  camera clarity.  The monitor is brighter and crisper. Immediate responses with accuracy.This device is tweaked for quality improvement and I was very impressed."
"Everything at my fingertips...I love this device! I have wanted one for a few years, but dragged my feet. I can now access my recipes on Food Network, see the camera at my front door, hear the news, get the weather, listen to podcasts and music, I could go on and on. My only issue is that I want to mount it on the wall; we are working on that."
"Alexa show, a great technology.I like the ability to not only hear great music, but on certain songs, you even see the words if you want to sing along. Another neat feature is to have a video chat with someone else who has alexa, although still not sure how to use it.My biggest negative is that no instructions are provided on using the show."
"We enjoy it BUT just a few bugs to workout.It get dirty easy and it's hard to clean in the grooves, about 4 ppl us the show with my 13yr old son being the main one.I like it but it has some issues, my two echo dots will play music when I tell my show to play music, I called support and they got me back on track but I didn't like itEveryone in the has their own echo device and I dont like it when it connects to other devices without my command."
"This one's a winner.The video and sound quality are stunning! This is the third Echo Show for our home but the other two are Echo Show 5s; the 5 is a great product but the difference between the 5 and 8 is shocking. This  Echo Show 8 rivals our very expensive 4K UHD TV! I am thoroughly impressed. Well done, Amazon. Keep them coming."
Great Family Gift.This is not a review for the product but for it's use. Bought 5 of these for Christmas at the discounted price for each family household so we could all face to face. Faced to faced with my sister in Denver (I'm in Cali) and it was wonderful. She and my brother love it! Thanks Alexa for connecting us family members.
"Does not work with Zmodo devises.Bought this to view my Zmodo cameras, as they are shown together in The show 8 page.  They do not even with hours on phone with tech support and a 2 day wait for there review.  They came back with the typical response when two different companies products  are trying to work together.  Our Equipment Is Work Fine It Must Be There Problem.  The cameras work on other devices with no problem, Just not any of Amazon Alexas products. Dont get Marshall"
"Easy to use, setup, and sounds good.Great combination of the smart assistant. Put one in the living room and one in the bedroom. I love how it has the slider for the camera. Because we live in a time where our privacy is important. It was super easy to set up and I love the sound quality these devices put out.  above all I love the clock faces on the Mini one"
"Echo 8.Like the display. Like the sound quality. I like the other features. ABSOLUTELY HATE that you can’t turn OFF the Alexa suggestions at the bottom of the screen. I would add stars if it could be turned off. You’re customers are not dumb, they know how to work Alexa functions and how to explore what Alexa can do."
Great product but I share the frustration about the “try Alexa” pop-ups.I’m really happy with the functionality and I’m also happy I spent a few extra dollars for the 8. It’s been great so far but I do share the same frustration as others with the “try Alexa” commands that constantly flash along the bottom. You should be able to shut those off as those aren’t necessarily revenue drivers for amazon so I’m not sure why they are so wed to making them mandatory.  It’s the only reason this doesn’t get 5 stars from me.
"This Echo 8 is amazing!I love the display on this Echo 8. It always has very good sound quality which I was pleasantly surprised by. This does so much more than I originally thought and I use it constantly. You can customize routines, play the news, play the music you want to listen to, etc. It not only plays Amazon music but you can link it to Spotify, Pandora, IHeartRadio, etc. This is such a great value for everything that it is capable of doing. I just love it!"
"works the first than stops working after the second day.It hears but will not follow command after the second day even after resetting to factory setting and switching wifi band three times,  call tech support five times and end up having to send replacement.  very disappointed with echo show 8, never have any problems before, I have 6 kindle two echo dot and this is the first device that let me down from amazon"
"Wonderful Product Tech needs training.Tech support needs a little more training and knowledge of their own product, when I called people were laughing babies were crying, hard to heard and understand also “There is a 50/50 change you echo show can do that” was the answer I got, after 15min wait.. It’s a wonderful product I love it!!!!!"
Superb sound quality!!Sound quality on this is fantastic! I was amazed at the loudness and quality that comes from the built in speakers. I have always had to connect my echo dots to my stereo for full sound and with this new echo show I don’t even have to worry about it! Love the fact when music is playing it shows the words on the screen as well!
"Echo Show 8 Needs A Large Clock Display Option.I have both the Echo Show 5 and 8.While they are both excellent products, I much prefer the LARGE CLOCK DISPLAY OPTION AVAILABLE ON THE ECHO SHOW 5.I contacted Amazon and asked them to include the large clock display option on the Echo Show 8 and they seemed receptive to my suggestion."
Must Have.Love it!  I have a show 5 in my den and Master Bedroom. I also have a Show 8 in my kitchen and 4 other various Echos through out the house. I can speak softly anywhere in my home and Alexa hears me. And it is awesome to play music everywhere and have music playing no matter where you are in the house and makes a perfect job for any smart home
"Wait to see if they resolve the problem with device!!Bought 3 of the echo show 8, and all of the are having trouble understanding me. Did have these on the other echo shows I have. I think They need a soft wear upgrade, but says there are no upgrade. Other family members bought the echo show 8 too, and having the same problem. Don’t know if they push these devices out for Christmas, or because they were out of stock, and they will worry about the problem later. Was very surprised that even before they were released in November, that they went on sale!  If they continue to have these problems, will return them back to Amazon."
Nice addition.I love technology and anything that adds fun to doing ordinary chores. I have other Alexa plugs and dots and they all fit in nicely with my requests. The music is clear and the pictures streaming are nice. I change it to the scenery when things get repetitive.I am still learning though how to use it!
"Amazing to add to any kitchen or office.Sounds great, looks great, glad I bought one. Was disappointed to find it for $25.00 less the day I received it. Wish Amazon had a ""difference refund."""
"Loud and Clear, screen is great.The best Echo device I've own. The screen is clear. Speaker is loud and clear. I love everything about it. It does everything my Echo and Echo Dot do plus more. Thanks for the big 8"" touch screen. It's a lot easier to configure since. You can config all on the device instead of using the Amazon Alexa app."
"Useless without a hub.I suppose most electronics that are like these are pretty much useless without a hub, give that I knew that going in I was surprised to learn that the picture quality although okay isn't what I expected.  I have also noticed that when I tellAlexa to cancel...she doesn't.  I could go on and on about things Echo 8 doesn't do but it's late and I'm frustrated."
Great screen and sound. Perfect size for the kitchen.Got This as a Christmas gift. Now we are making our house a smart house. Love that this doubles as a digital photo frame. Have not begin to scratch the surface of all the capabilities. The screen resolution is excellent and the sound is really good too. Now thinking about getting a few small echo dots for some of the other areas of the house.
"Works Great.Had the Echo Show 5 and purchased this.  Moved this in place and brought my Show 5 to work. I use this as an alarm clock, to give me the weather forecast, turn on and off lights as well as the other Alexa stuff it can do.  It is nice to have a screen this size when viewing my outdoor cameras.  Pricing was great!"
Larger screen to watch cooking videos or read recipes while cooking.I already have the Echo 5 for the room so I bought the Echo 8 for the living room and kitchen. Screen is larger so you can watch cooking videos or check your security cameras from a longer distance than the smaller Echos. It took minutes to hookup since I already had the Echo 5 (which was easy as well).
Not up to par with other devices. Disappointing.Alexa is by far less usable on this device than any other I have. Alexa regularly performs the wrong activity when given a command. Alexa does not understand the stop command on this device. The device frequently takes on a mind of its own which requires unplugging the device to make it stop. The sound quality is at best sub par. Voices when playing something as simple as the news are bad at any kind of elevated volume. The screen is fine but the much less expensive Dot is a better device.
"Cool device to talk about.I have the show 5 in my bedroom as a super smart alarm clock and this as just another smart device. I like this one except the display, the screensaver option is pretty basic and relocated the time to a random corner. Other than that, it’s a cool device. Hopefully one day they will be able to have a YouTube integration."
Missing features we all want. Regretting my purchase.So you don’t get Netflix or YouTube with this. I though this would be great in the kitchen so I could follow along some YouTube recipes or maybe catch up on some series while I washed dishes. It really is just a glorified music streamer/Alexa. Debating returning in and just mounting an iPad under the cabinets.
Microphone sucks.The microphones on this is not as effective as a regular echo. You either have to scream or be close to it. And the ads that keep showing at the bottom is also nerving.
Excellent and helpful home accessory.So far so good.  Makes my smart home easier to manage.  The only issue i have is that sometimes it'll misunderstands commands and go way off topic.
Smaller imprint but bigger and clearer screen.I find that it doesn’t understand me frequently and answers about something completely different. I am hoping it is because of alexas need to learn my voice. I bought it to replace the original alexa show( that one move to the family room) the screen is much clearer. The sound clear and good quality.
"Great device.The Echo Show 8 is the fifth (1 Amazon Echo, and 3 dots) Echo device I've purchased and it's by far my favorite . Nearly ready to use out of box with an easy set up and wonderful interactive experience thereafter. If you're looking for a device with video playback capabilities I would look no further!"
"Recommended.Bought this for my daughter  and granddaughters for Christmas and they love it, it was simple to set up and even easier to use, this was an awesome purchase on Amazon got 2 for the price of one...the sound and picture are great, only regret is I should have bought more for gifts throughout the year."
"AMAZING product. Damaged when received.Incredible product. Love it so much! The reason I have given 3 stars is because when I unpackaged the item I noticed a chunk of paint out of the top where there is metal showing. So I now have a scratch on the top of the screen that was not from me, but from the packaging by amazon. Disappointed but not ordering a new one because the item is out of stock for a while."
"Nice.Great sound quality, picture is nice. Movies look great. Unfortunately, this show and any Alexa don't really offer a lot. However good to have."
"Beautiful detail screen.Hi everybody, I am very please with my echo 8. I decided to go along with it because Google is 7 inches. Everything is working as it should. I am learning more and more Every day as I am using it. The screen is very bright and clear and detailed. When playing music it has a nice kick to the subwoofer. So far so good. When  I experience  anything new I will update my review. I highly recommend it"
"Echo Show is awesome.Everything you like about an Echo but with a video screen. Lots of screen customizations that people miss or ignore but then complain about. Wish they would make an echo fire show video, with HDMI out and full playback capabilities in screen.The sound is very good with the built in speaker."
"great buy.While some of the Alexa products are not as sophisticated or overpriced this echo show is a lot in a small package. video surveillance application when connected to ring, voice control of your residence with smart plugs and bulbs.  It allows for this and more depending on the connected product."
"So much fun!!Cannot believe how this packs a punch on sound quality!  So happy I went with the larger Echo 8 screen size!  Initially ordered the sandstone, which is much cleaner looking in my opinion but can definitely see how the speaker side will quickly collect hand residue and dust.  Easy to use, easy to integrate."
"Love all the features and works amazing with Ring Doorbell.I really like the size of the screen and Alexa. I originally purchased it for my Ring Doorbell, but quickly found other features I really like. I am using it as an alarm clock, for music and quick answers. This is my 1st Alexa product so I can't compare to previous versions. I love that I can ask to see my front door and see who is there in seconds. So far, so good and no complaints."
"No Netflix /Hulu/streaming services.Two stars because it's 2019, and Amazon seems to think you would not like to be able to watch Netflix, or Hulu, or HBOGo, or even YouTube (YouTube works, but only in a browser). If you're hoping to be able to use these apps for video services, don't bother purchasing this. Look elsewhere."
Great addition to smart home.I do prefer echo devices to good because of being able to use skills. But that being said I do love the screen size of the show 8. Perfect size for any room in your home. My biggest complaint is the same as everyone else not being able to turn off the try this message. It didn’t bother me until we decided to take it off and we can. Would love to be more in control of the device than be limited by it.
"I love this thing.Didn’t think I’d use it as much as I do! I bought it to watch my kids in the playroom while I’m in the kitchen with my indoor ring camera. I use it for so much more! My husband was originally making our home “smarter”, but once I got this, I’ve been leading the pack (so to say) with groups and adding our devices! I preordered mine and bestbuy matched the $100 price, I had a coupon and points, and the manager messed up a little (which he caught and said I can have that discount) I ended up paying $70. I would’ve been upset paying full price, since they’ve been marked down to $80 since Black Friday."
"Echo Show 8 on top of 5 and 10.I now have a Echo Show 5, 10 and 8, having just bought the 8.  I am sort of using the 5 as an alarm clock on my nightstand. The 10 is in the study with my PC and the 8 is going to replace the 5 mostly for the better sound and video quality improvements.  I like the Show 8 much better than the 5 for just those reasons.  The 10 is too big to do much with."
Bought this to go with Ring doorbell.I bought the Show 8 to go with Ring doorbell.  Turns out its another echo with video.  the speakers are great with great sound.  The video is good.  I do have a problem with ring but is getting that product replaced.  I like it but I keep the camera covered.  I have not tested video call yet.  So far so good!
"Perfect except for...This was a good upgrade from the Echo.  Good quality, sound, functionality.  Very easy to set up and use.  BUT the ""try...."" banners at the bottom of every screen are super annoying.  I've seen many complaints about this; not sure why Amazon doesn't issue a software upgrade to get rid of it."
"Great item.I bought this for me and told my husband 'thanks for the Christmas gift'.  If my Echo Show ran for the presidency, I would definitely vote for it.  I've listened to music, gotten a 'heads up' on the upcoming weather and news, watch a movie and gotten good advice from this device.  Love it."
"Good job, but...Was very impressed with the ease of set up. Easier than the dot. Color is good and clear. Sound is good, but can get a little ""tinny"" at upper levels. I am disappointed that you can not run a separate visual and audio. For instance, run audible and have the fireplace on visually. I would think that would be part of the perks of having the  show. Perhaps I missed something? You can, as usual, run a timer or alarm and other things. Overall, I am very pleased."
"Great Display Size for Older Person.The size and image quality of the 8"" device suits my older eyes much better than the Echo spot it replaced on my desk. This alone justifies the investment for me.  I dislike the non-intuitive way to stop a video (Alexa, home screen).  The sound quality is better than that of smaller Echo devices I own, but still not good enough to listen to music getting fatigued after a while."
Better than the Dots!Have the Echo Show 8 right by my Living Room chair and use it often.  Can’t wait for baseball season to have Alexa show me updates on scores.  There is quite a bit to learn but just ask Alexa and she “usually” show/do things for you. I like the evolving skills with Alexa and she recognizes both my wife and my voice and connects to our respective accounts.  Much better and more fun than the Dots!!  Wait for deals for a decent and lower price!
Works as Advertised.The image is very clear and integrates easily into the Alexa household.  I find the sound a bit bass-y and have adjusted the built-in equalizer to bring out more treble.  Overall a terrific device. It integrated well with my Meross switches and plugs as well as the Ring Security system.
"8-inch screen is better than the 5-inch...and speakers are better too.Love this device. I can view my RING cameras on it, read recipes, set reminders, play music. Really functional and the screen is much better quality than the Echo Show 5 (the smaller version of this device). Go with this 8"" version because the speakers are much better than the 5"" version."
"NO YOUTUBE???!!!I hate to say I am extremely disappointed that this wont get Youtube. I purchased this and the 10""THAT gets Youtube. I specifically asked prior to purchase and was told yes. I asked it to connect and it said ""this generation echo show does not support YouTube. I've had it set up for 2 days using it. Not cool Amazon"
AMAZON needs better product development and quality control.Our first two echo shows failed.  One by forever looping in a “optimizing” mode and not connecting to the wifi if it ever did stop “optimizing”This will be our last echo show if this one fails as wellAMAZON you need much better product development and quality control.
"Hard of hearing.Unlike my other Echo devices, Alexa has trouble hearing when playing something.  Probably will be fixed in a future software update."
"Perfect Size for My Room.Received my Echo Show 8, and easily set it up.  Still trying to figure out a few things, but overall this exceeded my expectations.  The size is perfect for my room.  Not too big, not too small.  The only thing that bothers me is the scrolling suggestions on the bottom.  I get Amazon wanting people to ""try"" things, but we are not children.  If we want something from Alexa we will ask without a prompt."
"Love my Echo Sho.Easy to set up, the more I use it the better it understands my commands.  Love seeing song lyrics, recipes are easy and the list feature is really convenient - create the list verbally with SHO then can view the list on your phone in the app and check things off once you buy/complete them"
Alexa does everything you ask her to do.I love It! The set up was in seconds. I have Ring.com so I asked Alexa show me the front door and Wham!! I have an echo and a the bigger one. They are all  great!! She did..quick. The bass on this sounds great! I asked to play songs and video's with no issues. I went in to settings and stop all the Alexa advertisement and etc.
"Echo Show 8 - HD 8"".We've only had the Echo Show 8- HD 8"" for a few days and we already love it. It's great to have information right at your fingertips via Alexa from getting the weather forecast to finding out how much JLO makes a year. You get all kinds of information plus music and a lot of other great features. I don't know how we functioned without it. Great Buy."
"Echo Show 8, a nice smaller size.I own two Echo Show 2nd Gen devices.  The Echo Show 8 makes a nice desktop edition with a slightly smaller screen.  Despite having the same resolution as Echo Show 2nd Gen, I have not been able to display all of my cameras on the new device.  Sound quality tops the Echo Show 1st Gen."
"The best Echo yet.The best screen yet, I just wish it were larger.I highly recommend the optional base. It not only adds some needed height but allows you to tip the screen down just a bit which I feel was required.The extra height of the optional base is especially needed for crowded counters because anything you put down in front of the device blocks the screen."
"My Kitchen Companion.I ordered this during one of the Christmas Lightning Deals. I got it for myself because I love to cook and bake. I would use my iPhone or Mac in the kitchen and found it inconvenient.So, when I saw the deal, which by the way, also came with a free Echo Dot I snatched it up. Sound quality is excellent. Especially love the sound of the bass.  Color and picture display is so clear, crisp and vibrant."
"Excellent Smart Home “Assistant”.I love the sleek, minimalist design of the Echo Show 8. The interface is extremely easy to set up and automatically connected to the WiFi in my home without me having to search for my WiFi name and password. Also, setting up the Echo Show was very easy and straightforward.The number of things that you can do is almost infinite and seems to be increasing every day. The  clarity of screen is excellent.  I have the Echo Show 8 on my kitchen countertop.  Alexa recognizes my voice commands weekendI’m standing several feet away, even in the hallway."
Useless camera due to horrible placement.I give it 3 stars. The camera kind of useless. Because the screen made tilted angle up so the camera will be pointed up the celling when you make drop in video call.  Hello Amazon i want to see my family not the celling. Need some kind of stand to tilt the screen and the camera forward.
"Echo trade-in program is broken...I recently purchased an Echo Show 8 using the trade-in program to recycle some of my old Echo equipment.  The devices that I returned for trade-in were in excellent working condition without any physical damage.  Amazon promised a certain trade-in amount for such equipment but without any good explanation discounted the value of the returned equipment to less than half of the expected value.  The reason given for the discount was ""yes"" which has no meaning.  After appeal, I was able to get the full amount promised by the program but the whole affair raised issues about how the program is being managed."
"Small clock, constant try Alexa.You can’t turn off the try Alexa on this! I at least was able to make it very occasional on the show 5, but it’s constant on the 8 no matter what you do. You can’t make the time display larger unless you put on do not disturb, and then you can’t use it! If you want to use this as an alarm clock or a clock at all, even though the echo show 5 is smaller it works much much better"
Buy if u love freedom lol jkjk.Bought it for my husband for Christmas and now he won't let it out of his sight he loves me more than hate baby If it is not around him he freaks out a little bit and tell him find that he sleeps with it at his bedside torally obsessed with this product  It is like the new greatest adventure learned about and he's going on a long trip
Is fun.So...the big debate about the try alexa on the bottom of the screen....goes away when not messed with on night mode.....see the photos.  Yes it would be nice if there was an option to not have it.....but....there are a bunch of things i would never have thought of...so....IS FUN
"One of the best Amazon devices with Alexa!I know I have yet to scratch the surface with what this amazing device can do but so far I have used it as an alarm clock, a device to monitor my Ring devices installed around my home, watch Amazon Prime movies, listen to music and so on. I am definitely getting more of these and giving them as gifts."
The New Show has More Go.We had and enjoyed our original Show and retired it to our basement. The new Echo Show is slightly more compact but has better sound quality and a much crisper display. It has the place of honor in the kitchen where we use it often to play music and maintain our shopping lists.
Fantastic Echo Show!Love this new Echo Show 8 for our living room!  We have it connected to our Ring doorbell and camera and being able to see who is at the door or in the driveway is a game changer.  I know when a delivery is being made or if someone is there who shouldn't be.  I also run my Roomba with it and turn on and off the lights!  Love Alexa!!
"Super easy for seniors to use.This has changed everything when I comes to calling my elderly mother.  .  We are hundreds of miles apart and now I can video call her, even “drop in”. She enjoys ours conversations so much more.  Any new technology is normally very difficult for her, but this is super simple to answer and she loves it.If you have elderly parents, this is a must have!"
"Perfect for the kitchen.I love it. People complain about the tips on the screen, but boohoo. The sound is loud, which is great. I asked for a recipe and it popped up and gave me everything I needed, step by step. I like watching my shows. I don't like that I cant see all the shows I want. I also wished I could get netflix and disney+. But eh. Love it"
"Alexa (Echo 8) vs Google Assistant (Google Nest 7).I have both google nest home and Echo 8 connected to Samsung SmartThings hub. In my experience Google voice assistant is more intelligent in following instructions. With better AI it can make better  sense even from short instructions where Alexa fails to understand. Overall Echo 8 is a better product than Google nest 7. Both could have zwave and zigbee hubs built in making them a complete smart home hub eliminating need for middleware product like SmartThings hub. Though like SmartThings hub, the best smart  home hub so far."
"Just Right!!!Sounds better than the Echo 5"" but not quite as good as the Echo 10"". Screen size is much better than the 5"". In other words. its as close to the Echo 10"" as you can get.  The bass is better on the Echo 10' because of larger speakers, but I'm very happy with the purchase and will buy more."
I could use more info.I hear a great deal of  background noise when using my Ring doorbell  I wish that more information or a relevant web site was provided to help set up and use the device when other Alexa  products are already in use.  I'mnot sure which device is controlling various functions.
"I just LOVE, LOVE, LOOOVE my Alexa Show 8!!!I have been having a blast with it. I just love all the really fun features... EXCELLENT sound quality.... I always use the timers and alarms. just love, love LOOOOVE lol.. I want to get Alexa enabled lamps for it. Unsure if I posted 2 reviews. I just am so excited about it if I did oh well lol"
"Great kitchen companion.Had the device setup before shipping so setup was easy. Just plugged it in. I don’t see the recommendations as an issue. It displays news, sports scores and pictures from FB. I love this device. Plus I can see my ring doorbell from the kitchen for when family arrives while I am cooking."
"Never thought I'd love Alexa this much!I absolutely love this thing! Everyday I find something new I can do with it. Music, weather, recipes, news, videos, jokes! I can shop with it and tell it to set timers.  But the one thing I didn't expect was my 6 year old being the main user. Every time I turn around, he asks Alexa something. He asks about math, planets, jokes. He asks Alexa to talk like a pirate, to tell him how to make something and of course to play his favorite songs. Alexa is his bestie. Now I have an Echo show in my kitchen and bedroom and my six year old is teaching his grandpa how to use it!"
Purchased because Amazon stated it would worked with a Security Flood light Camra.Update: 1/9/2020I finally got my security camera's to work with Echo 8. Very happy that I found the answer to my issue of Alexa not able to see my Cameras. Because of this I changed my review to 4. If Alexa would recognize my voice all the time I would have given Echo8 five stars.
"Works great but volume keeps resetting.My whole house has been integrated except for the show and I love this!  The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars is because it seems to reset the volume to the loudest setting everytime we speak to it and it is very annoying. If this can be corrected, it would absolutely be 5 stars."
"Loving this.What's not to like? I tell it to do basic commands on/off lights, Roomba &amp; play ""yacht rock"" for my cats who get easily distressed by sirens. The sound is awesome. Like asking for a recipe and can actually following it step by step without glasses I haven't watched a movie on it tho."
Fairly easy to get started.This was fairly easy to set up...but I had to reinstall my smart bulbs and plugs.  I thought it would automatically discover them.  It works well now...still playing with it to find out what it can do.  It's not quite as friendly as it says everywhere but it's fun and new.
"Just getting started.Used in the kitchen. Just getting started. Music, shopping list and some basic functions. Seems to recognize voice and has a basic understanding that is intuitive. Doesn't always have an answer and refers you to the manual instead of answering directly. Possible problems may be caused by improper context. Does movies with our Amazon Prime subscription. More to learn, I'm afraid. All us old guys need a 5 year old to get us started."
"Great Size Screen.We added this echo for a screen based experience in the kitchen. It is a great size for visibility without being so large as the Echo Show 10. Only bad issue is the sound quality is not quite as good as our Echo Plus. Other than that, it is a wonderful addition to our smart home setup."
"Alexa does not listen well.Compared to my dot, I almost have to shout at my show. Aside from having to return a bad first unit, I have not had the problem of screen bleed (or not working). The sound on this is too much bass and misses the high note. I like the skills and apps but hate the Alexa Try This."
"Great sound and picture.Beautiful sound and picture! Great bass! I was thinking of pairing it with another speaker, but it fills my kitchen with the right sound. It was wonderful during the holidays filling our area with Christmas music that our 25 guests enjoyed! I also gifted 1 to my brother who loved it!"
"I don't want to ""Try"" this Show anymore...Look, it's not a bad device. Sounds alright, screen is good quality. But despite what everyone claims, you CANNOT turn off the ""Try"" recommendations. Amazon, you need to listen. Let us turn THIS exact feature off. If it continues to annoy me, I am sending this thing back."
DO NOT BUY THIS!!!I purchased this BRAND NEW echo show 8 a week before christmas and it came in time. I needed this for my gender reveal to show pictures on a slideshow and play music. It worked perfectly for one day then  alexa just stopped responding. I called amazon customer service on was on the phone for hours with troubleshooting options and went through all of them. They decided it was not functioning right and sent me a RECONDITIONED one when i payed for a BRAND NEW one. Thank you amazon for ruining my christmas and gender reveal........ In the picture above the right box is the new one i purchased and the left one was a RECONDITIONED one they sent..
"Just buy one already!My wife loves it. She uses it in the kitchen every day. Also we integrated our Wyze security cameras, TV, weather station, Ring, and lights. We bought one for the bedroom as well. It’s not meant to be a tablet replacement in my opinion. It’s a new category of smart devices to upgrade and automate your home."
"Sleek and awesome.We love Alexa. This Echo Show 8 is nice and sleek looking. It was already linked to my Amazon account so all I had to do was plug it in and set up the basic stuff...language, time zone. So far it’s working great. I set up my photos from Amazon Photos as the background."
"So many uses.I feel like I am barely scratching the surface of what Alexa can do. I listen to music all the time. I get news and weather updates. Alexa suggests all sorts of things she can do such as provide recipes, tell jokes, answer questions, etc. The sound quality is wonderful. This is my second device and I love it!"
"Wish I bought two on Black Friday.Works well with wyze cameras, ring doorbell, august door lock, and all other normal Alexa enabled devices. Love ""seeing"" stuff, like daily news, recipes, song lyrics . . . so fun for aging mother (bought for her), easy to use, and keeps her company when we're at work."
"Perfect size, almost perfect sound.First time buying one, watched and read tons of reviews. For what I paid I think I received a quality piece of merchandise . Sound on the very higher end is slightly distorted, PLENTY of bass. still learning what all can be done with it but , videos calls are great with the grandkids, get weather, news, etc, all you have to say is Alexa give me the news, etc. Perfect size for the kitchen counter."
"This one is sweet!Everybody loves this!  The screen is good size for watching movies. Alexa is a little testy sometimes but you learn to love her. It has a wonderful sound quality not tinny or muted. You can set an alarm , listen to music and the alarm interrupts.  Very nice addition to our home."
Amazon Echo is great for seniors!This was a gift from my son!  He set it up and showed us how to use it!  Our knowledge and comfort level is growing!  We are pleased about the drop in that allows me to check in on my husband while I am out running errands.  It provides a level of security for seniors!
Still in love with Alexa.I was excited to get my echo show as I hadn't had one before I've had the dot the prime and also auto all working pretty good haven't been able to use show as much as I thought I would quality as far as sound is not as good as the prime but that was expected I am happy with it no real complaints and would recommend
"As described.Does what I was expecting. Only disappointment was the lack of clock faces and style and the small clock, no full screen. I don't want photos on the screen just a standard display when not in use. The clock or clock and date in a large don't would have been wonderful."
"Great Product to Relieve Anxiety.I bought the Echo Show as a Christmas gift to the family a couple of weeks ago. That was what they thought at least. The Show is great whenever I need to drop in on my dogs to make sure they aren't causing complete havoc in my household. Sure, the video quality is great and the sound is fantastic but I cannot stress how much I love the drop in feature to make sure my kids aren't destroying the house while I'm gone or to guarantee that the dogs haven't collectively figured out how to loot the fridge. I highly recommend this product."
"They got it right.I have an echo show 5, which like baby Yoda, needed to learn a few things.the echo 8 is the big brother who finished collage and is ready for prime time.Great features, and voice recognition that WORKS.Great for a kitchen (where I have mine)"
"Another Amazon winner.This is my second SHOW. First one was Gen 1. I like that there is less bezel and a smaller footprint but the sound, picture quality and screen size is not compromised. My Gen 1 was working fine but this was a deal I couldn't pass up. Kudos to all the Alexa lineup!"
"It just keeps surprising!It just keeps surprising!  I have it integrated with my hulu live service and was only a little disappointed that I didn't have Weather Channel or Weather Nation, until I remembered the ""Stream Player"" skill.  That added a whole bunch more pluses to an already great device!"
Likely will not work with old Echo light fixtures etc.Do not purchase Echo Show 8 If you have been tested in the Eco system prior.. It is likely  not able to communicate or pair with old echo systems. I was informed I need to purchase a hub to make it work. I have had a smart home for sometime. Check it out before you buy it.
Don't  think I'm using device capability.Instructions with device non existing. Downloaded manual via Kindle not that much help.  Want to be able to sync other devices but haven't figured it out yet.  Need better help!!! Device is one of 4 Echos in the house.  Not as good as Siri. Maybe it will get better.
Disappointing.I was really hoping that when I purchased this that it wasn’t going to be something you were going to be limited to do. I bought this for my lady so that she could watch shows on it but there’s is only Hulu and well we don’t use that. You can’t even add more apps. You’re stuck with the ones that aren’t built in. Very upsetting.
What was Amazon thinking?I bought the show 8 because I have a show that I love. I really enjoy having the larger screen and the show 8 has much better sound. During the initial setup I was very disappointed when I realized that the show 8 dose not allow you to have a customizable clock screen. Why would Amazon not carryover this great feature from the show 5. I considered sending the show 8 back because of this shortcoming. I was looking forward to having a large analog clock on the screen of the show 8. PLEASE FIX THIS AMAZON!!!
"Let's me know who's at the front door.This device is really nice, keeps me informed with the latest news. Also gives me many recipes, you tube videos and some free music.Actually bought 3 so my two daughters and I can have video calls and I can see who is at the front door from wherever I'm at."
"Great Sound.This Echo Show joins my Amazon ""Everywhere Group"" for more music in yet another room. (Note you must have the Amazon Music Family Plan but its well worth it. )  The sound is great, and I am able to video chat with this large 8 inch screen with my daughter in Hawaii who received this for Christmas.  I have it in the Kitchen and also use it to find recipes to try, which I can then look at as I'm preparing, and its timer function is also useful.  If you like the Dot, you'll love the Show."
Scroll at bottom is easy to stop.Like viper am wrote. The skill scroll only shows for a few seconds . Works great for my cameras and the speakers are good . It’s like all the good reviews. Mention . Pay no attention to those who have difficulty .. it’s really very simple. But for some yo know.
"Good screen, Very good sound. Bad Alexa integration.I believe 8 inch screen is just right for being in the kitchen.The sound quality is very good with surprising deep bass. Screen is not bad either.But if you are looking for a very good integration with Alexa as in showing Nest/Ring doorbell, Schlage locks, Rachio sprinkler, this device is Not for you. This has a lot of potential but not yet ready for prime time. Could be really great if Amazon programmers actually did their job.And yes, the Tech Support help desk is pretty much useless."
Just average.Have been using the Echo Show 8 for a couple of months now. I have it in the kitchen and I use it often as a timer when cooking. It has a difficulty recognizing me telling it to stop the timer when it goes off. In addition I have Arlo cameras for which there is direct integration to work with Alexa. However I find it that it takes a very long time to load at times (upwards of 2 minutes) and on occasion it doesn’t load the camera feed at all. Overall I would have to say this is a 3 star device. I also have a google home speaker which I feel works a lot more fluid and has better voice recognition.
"Great addition.We bought the first one because of the addition of a new ring doorbell.  Liked it so much added one to the upstairs.  Good quality picture, didn't think I would care for the song lyrics it displays, but I do.  In fact the whole extended family loves it.  Also, perfect to watch the nursery cam."
A better stand would be great to allow it to lean further down with better balance.I absolutely love the Alexa stuff but echo show 5 or 8 is great. When I’m away at work I am able to call and talk to my little girl in the morning and she can see me and I can see her. I love everything that it allows me to control in my house. Just a great invention
"Didn’t think I’d enjoy more than one show in the house.Love it. I had dots and 1st gen show. Used it in the kitchen for recipes but got a 5 for bedside clock and 8 for living room.  Handy for weather, smart lights, spelling and definitions when writing, and watching videos on prime. Love the nature pictures that scroll through in the living room."
"I like it, but...Sound is good. Display is good. It seems to buffer too much, even when viewing my Wyze camera, that I bought with this as a set, on my own LAN. I gave a lower score on integration with Alexa because many of the skills just don't work. I can't control my Roku or view my VStarCam cameras even though there are skills for both."
"Open box sold as new! 😕.The product is as expected it, but there is something amiss with the package: the seal is broken. I assume it's a returned product. Even though it's just an open box, it cannot be sold as new.  I would like to return it. I waited 20 days to have it. Let's be serious!"
"Handier than I thought.Bought the set for the deal and my spouse needing something to play thunderstorms for him at night.  Didn't realize how easy and addictive the tool would become in our every day life.  Getting the hang of asking more and more questions; however, the hardest part is learning the cadence in which to ask the questions."
"The bass makes the unit move on granite counter tops.After easily installing the beautiful device I told Alexa to play Sade... the bass was enough to make the unit move. The device began to move in a clockwise motion. I turned the bass all the way down, but it still moved when the volume was turned up. It appears that it may dance it self off the counter. I am ordering the stand. I will repost to see if that fixes the movement."
"Very poor microphone quality.I like the big screen and that you can video call, but I hate that you can't make the clock full screen. Also, I often have to repeat myself several times before it actually responds or does what I ask. Most of the time, my echo dot in the next room over will pick me up even when the show 8 does not, and I'm sitting right next to it. Very disappointing to say the least."
Echo Show.There is NOTHING I don't like about the Echo Show - visual screen is luminous - voice is perfect - Echo Show gives you hints about different features it will do - plays music - you can view tv programs - it helps with recipes - is a security monitor - LOVE IT!!!!!!
Love the Echo Show 8!This product is an amazing addition to our kitchen. We are able to ask Alexa all sorts of things and have it help us all around the house. What's more is that it helps bring the family together with features like the announcement that goes across the house.
"I like it.I have plenty of ""devices"", got this as a present.  Sound quality and volume are great, over my Echo Plus.  Don't consider this a ""hub"", it isn't. Still using my Echo Plus as the connection.  Sound quality is really great - avoiding the word ""amazing"", but it out does the Echo Plus."
"Hands Off Commands.This is a great device for listening to Amazon Music! Alexa, Play Edith Piaf. And Alexa plays Edith Piaf! It's that easy. It's also great for setting reminders. Echo easily connects to a Bluetooth speaker, but the sound is very good a device of this size."
"Can't turn off ""Try This"" and annoying pop up cards.The most annoying ""feature"" is the constant bombardment of ""Try this"" tips and pop up cards.  I've tried to dismiss these from the setting menu to no avail.  It does make a good hub for managing smart home device, but at the cost of being pinged by cards with irrelevant information."
Expensive compaired to its worth!I like the sound of it but YouTube is via browser which is not good and then Netflix I cant. On app add option. It's very Amazon service dependent. Language support is also limited compair to echo dot. For the size and weight lts very limited in what it can do. If you have to then get smaller one which same things. This one definitely need more features
The Echo Show is more fun than the Echo Dot.Having a display to look at is very appealing. Topics are shown which you might want to learn about and you can then ask Alexa. It is good as an appointment reminder and a clock. We're hooking ours up with a Ring doorbell and will be able to tell who's ringing our doorbell.
Neat gadget.I really like having this in my kitchen. I can watch prime video and use it just like my other Alexa electronics. The only thing that gets annoying is the try this captions that run along the bottom of the screen. I can't figure out how to turn that off.
This little device is way more impressive than I expected.What a pleasant surprise. To be able to play Amazon music and get the words in clear large type was a very positive surprise. To get many other Echo functions with the same addition is amazing. I am the limiting function - not the device. Very impressed.
"Great product.Great Product!  For all of those that complained about the ""ads"", they are suggestions to try and not ads.  You can remove them in the settings. Lighten up!"
"Greater than the 5 by 3 HaHa.We had a Show 5 for awhile and loved it, this is even better with the larger screen, we love the whole Alexa system. Moved the 5 to the bedroom. This 8 is really great especially using our Ring doorbell and interacting with our Dish Network receiver."
"So Far, So Good.Replaces the older model quite seamlessly. Haven't had it long enough, especially during the holidays, to try all the features. But ""she"" has answered all questions and played music well.  Haven't had a chance to watch videos yet, but I'll get to it."
Good mid range Echo Show.Good size for a kitchen top or desktop without having too notceable footprint.Microphonee appears not be able to pickup  commands across the room well.  Speaker not as powerful as Echo Show 2. Screen size between Echo Show 2 and Echo show 5 is just right.
"Sounds great, looks even better.Music sounds great with this Alexa, very good range across the frequencies.  Setup was very easy and intuitive, most of the setup was already done from my account information.  Picture quality is excellent, I have watched a few movies, recipes, and even my ring doorbell.  Overall This is just the right size for the kitchen of bedroom."
"Satisfied.Like I can video chat easily with family,  like that it plays my Anazon music and that I can watch shows if I want. As far as integration is concerned Google home does a better job with getting information, but Alexa does have the edge due to video options."
"Great picture quality and good sound.It's a great addition to the Echo line.  I love watching my stored pictures pop up throughout the day.  I would appreciate some control over the frequency of the picture changes.  The settings are easy to change but slow to act.  All in all, I'm pleased with the purchase."
"Essential device for the kitchen.We keep the Show 8 in our kitchen, where its visible from the stove and sink. We use it as a timer, to listen to music and to see family pictures when its idle. The family pictures are my personal favorite feature. I think the Echo 8 is the best mix of size (not to big, not too small) and audio quality. We also own three Show 5's which are sprinkled throughout the house."
Adt.Will not show your Adt cameras
"Agree that home display options are inadequate.I bought this despite reservations expressed by others about the clock size and the ""Try this"" feature that appears across the bottom.  But the review by viperamd64 convinced me that the shortcomings could be overcome by properly setting up the device.  The sequence viper suggests doesn't exist.  You cannot go to Home &amp; Clock. From settings you go directly to Home Content.  And making the suggested changes to Discovery and Rotate Continuously did not make the clock bigger nor stop the ""Try this"" messages.  I will keep tinkering, but I hope Amazon will update the software to fix these problems with an otherwise excellent device."
"Get rid of the stupid ""Try, Alexa..."".No reason to force people to have to look at this. A competent programmer could fix this issue in under 5 minutes which means Amazon intentionally wants to force you to have to see these. There is absolutely no reason for it. Totally uncalled for."
"Great size at an even greater price.Great price at under $80, love the size, I replaced the 7 inch I had in my man ace with this one.  Love that I can connect my Bose speaker to it.  We now have 5 Echo Shows.  Haven’t  been able to connect it via Bluetooth to my little Bose speaker."
"Sound Plus Video.Decided to purchase the 8"" Echo Sound. Glad I did. Good sound and like to view the music lyrics along with the sound.  Also like the daily snippets of news which I can ask Alexa to expand upon and view it at the same time. Keeps me up to date on the Stock Market and the recipes are a nice feature for someone like me who likes easy and simple meals."
Can watch Amazon Prime Movies.The Echo Show can do everything the Echo Dot can do plus some. I like the fact that it connects with my Ring door bell and will show who is at the door and I can speak to the person as well. I like that it shows all the Amazon Prime movies and you can play games on it like 'Deal or No Deal' or 'Jeopardy'.
"An Amazon Fan Boy.Originally ordered the Show 5. It met my expectations except the sound. I decided to keep the 5 for a smaller room, but ordered the Show 8 for the kitchen and Bam!... room filling sound as anticipated. The larger screen helps me to read recipes across the room. I went all in on the Alexa ecosystem this Christmas. Yeah... Amazon probably knows everything about me now... but they probably already did.... they certainly know my buying habits. The services they offer is and the associated devices are a bargain. I’m a fan. Keeping bringing me value, and I’ll be a fan for life."
"Good product, but was cheated on the price TWICE!Overall I am happy with the Show 5, but really annoyed by the pricing. I ordered it the week before Black Friday on a special pre-release offer. Then on Black Friday it was $20 cheaper. But it gets worse! Now it is another $20 cheaper meaning it is 40% off what I paid as a ""pre-release"" customer. NOT HAPPY AMAZON!One tip - You can use the Show as a sort of home security camera using ""drop in"". However, without the optional tilt base you will pretty much be staring at the ceiling with very little view of the room."
Very responsive and larger than the Echo Show 5.It's handy to use and easy to use.  I can access my home security cameras easily and it also reports any sounds or movements detected in my home.  Also great for so many other functions that it's an amazing tool and enjoyable asset for the home.
"Sound quality is great!The sound is great, there is bass and volumn goes pretty high. The screen when your talking to someone kinda gets pixelated. I wish there was a way to add fun filters to your calls. It is a little hard to get used to when it comes to how to work what's on the screen."
Alexa got way much better!L-O-V-E it!! Does so much for so little money. A touch screen controller with that quality is in the thousands of dollars in the pro market. Works as a digital picture frame as well and does so much more. I can even see my ring cameras by just asking Alexa.
"Life saver for new parents.Just had a new born so being able to control our lights with our hands full or in the middle of the night has been a blessing, adding a dot to our baby room for  calming music to white noise or any other thing you can think of to sooth your baby it has been a great choice and one I would recommend to anyone."
"You Can’t Go Wrong!I own literally every Amazon device. From Echo Dot, Echo Show, Echo 5 now the Echo 8. Set up is easy, love the quality of the speakers. I look forward to the next product Amazon comes out with. In short, you just can’t go wrong with the Echo 8."
"Like a Show 5 on Steroids.Bigger display and better sound than the Show 5, otherwise identical.  My one critical comment with both the Show 5 and 8 is that the mics aren't as good as they are on the old Gen 2 Dots."
"Need to unplug and reset twice now.For no reason, twice now Alexa stops responding and only displays information.  My echo spot never had this problem.  Unplugging the device and plugging back in fixes the problem but ""reboot"" should not have to happen.We'll see long term."
"GREAT Gadget.After a few days, I haven't even come close to exploring all the Echo 8 has to offer. Very interesting and somewhat easy to use. We're giving Echo 5s to our sons and our grandchildren for Christmas. Then, we'll explore some more capabilities."
Love it.I love this and use it in the morning to listen to a local radio station.  Sound quality is great and I have it set up to rotate my pictures off of my FB page.  I would have gave it a 5 but get tired of the suggestions running across the bottom.
"The handiest Show yet.I had the first ten, and it was OK, but too bulky. The Show 8 is perfect for my desk top with better sound, better picture and ab available rotating/tilting base. The camera/mic can be easily turned off when desired. I am extremely pleased!"
"Setup was very easy compared to the original Echo's.As mentioned the set up using the screen was very straight forward and easy. Two things we still need to investigate is how to get all the Echo's to play the same music at the same time, and to use the new echo as an intercom as we had before."
An improved Echo is overshadowed by the absence of clock face choices.The larger screen makes this a good choice except for not having clock face options that allow for a full screen clock. What is worse is that the picture on Amazon indicates one is able to have a full size clock. I am not sure what the point is of having a larger screen but a smaller clock. Amazon will hopefully offer a download for a variety of clock faces for the Echo Eight. Until they do I encourage you to buy the Echo Five if clock size is of importance
Works as expected.I have been using the unit for about a month now and it works as expected.  Set up was very simple and picked up all of my existing devices.  I like the feature of seeing my Ring doorbells.  I use this as a bedside clock and so much more.  Very happy with the purchase.
"Good screen size and still compact.It's a nice sized screen, which was my primary reason for buying it. So far it's working very well. I hooked it up to my Edifier bookshelf speakers for a nice music experience. Nice to watch movies in bed while my husband watches his shows on the tv."
"Best one yet.This is my favorite Echo unit to date and I've had pretty much all of them. I retired most to different rooms in my home, but this one is by far the best. Crisp image, great sound, works well and I like the camera/viewer shudder feature."
"Great speaker with the screen as an added bonus.This product is exactly what it is advertised to do. The speaker sounds nice, and the screen is helpful to have. It scrolls through top news and sports news based on your preferences. It works well in our kitchen and is connected to our Ring doorbells."
AMAZING.So once I figured out that I had two amazon accounts and I was signed into a different one on my Alexa app then I was signing into with this it was super easy! My boyfriend is obsessed with this thing! 100% worth the money if you love to cook!
"Almost but not.I like the thing. Weird that it doesn’t know it has a clock face to customize like the echo show 5?  And I can’t turn off the “Try this” Alexa hints?  Both Echo Show 8 or Fire TV won’t play my Vudu TV shows, yet will play an Apple TV show?  Come on... Amazon can do better."
Best Echo Yet.I have multiple Echoes in the house and this one sounds as good as the original echo and the screen is a good size.
"My show 8 eview.Although the technical documentation accompanying this product was insufficient for me, i managed to ultimately get several of my existing devices to work through this module.  It is still very new to me, but appears to be working as designed.  Now if I could just get my Ring and NetVue apps to respond faster when I ask Alexa to ""show me this or that"".  Appreciate an opportunity to participate with responses.Mike"
"The in-between stage, 5 too small, the 10 too big, goldy locks zone for me.I do with these were shipped with a stand instead of having to buy a 3rd party product. Other than that, the screen is nice, responds well and does what I need it to do with the integrations to my doorbell, cameras and security system."
Happy with the 8!So glad I chose the 8 instead of the 10! The 8 is bigger than you think it would be. The sound quality was VERY impressive as well. Sounded like it was coming from a way bigger speaker. Picture quality definitely is not lacking either.
Great but the home screen is not customizable for the Show 8.Does what it says. My complaint is the home screen and the inability to do any customization. It has a little clock and scrolls through skill suggestions. annoying and returned because of it.
"Alexa Echo Show 8.Was so easy to set up. Turn it on and it leads you through the set up. I have mine in my kitchen to help me with cooking. Very good quality screen time. Also, have my Ring doorbell hooked up to it, so I can see who is at the front door."
"Great Size and Performance.I have replaced my original Echo Show with the new Echo 8.  It's a great size.  The screen is brighter and sharper.  And the sound is worlds better.  Meanwhile, the old Echo Show got moved to the bedroom.  I'm enjoying having it there, as well."
"Every household should have an echo8.Received this as a Christmas gift and just love it,, It does not replace my small echo dot but is used with it in a different room. I replaced 2 old radios that were very static and hard to listen to, now with echo8 we can enjoy many things with alexa."
"Exceeding expectations so far!We have barely scratched the surface of our Echo’s capabilities, but are very pleased after a week of use. Amazon Music Unlimited is incredible! We have indulged in Christmas music, Gregorian chants, death metal, oldies and more. The recipes function is very cool. Set up of the device was intuitive and easy, and we downloaded the Alexa app as well. The Echo is sleek and attractive on our roll top desk. Sound quality is surprisingly good for a relatively small device."
"This is a nice addition to the basic dot.This adds streaming which is nice.  Integrates with Ring and Simplisafe.  Adds words to songs so it is a defacto karoke machine.I'm still exploring it, but I like it and it is worth the price, especially if you can get it on sale."
Great sound.I really liked this device. Only reason I didn't give a 5 star is because I wish I would put a timer for the background pictures. Sometimes they stop for a long time and then others it doesn't even change at all. Also wish that it would just open up YouTube rather than having to open up a web browser.
"Great Unit !Like the product fully, it's replacing my old echo show. Sound quality is much better also. My only dislike is buying a stand for it since it's in the kitchen which I believe is needed. Currently it is the stand priced to high. Tks"
Excellent product.Excellent product for the price. Connected right away with my other echo devices. Supper easy to set up. The only thing that would make this product better is if it came with a stand that you would be able to adjust the vision of what all you can see.
"Amazon Echo Show? Decent.Not as “smart” as I would like it to be. I thought it would do a lot more. It didn’t blow me away, but I’m not upset about my purchase because I got a good deal on it. Camera quality is awful, but I didn’t expect much out of the camera though."
"It does so much more than I will ever be able to use or even understand.It's fun, helpful, responsive. I need some detailed instructions as to how to use it. I would also like to know how to stop it from snooping. Sometimes I walk in the room  when there is no on there but and me and she is  ""listening.""  It doesn't concern me because there is nothing going on that I need to hide.  But it is disconcerting to know that someone ""out there"" is listening. It can sure feed one's paranoia."
"Full clock not available.One of the things I love about the Echo Show 5 is the ability to display a full clock.  This is not an option with Show 8.  In order to continually display the clock, you need to set up the Do Not Disturb, which will show the clock and turn off the Things to Try.  When playing prime video's, the picture is clear and the sound is good.  Overall, if I had purchased the Echo 8 first instead of the Echo 5, the shortcomings wouldn't have been as obvious.  In all honesty, I prefer the Echo 5, even though it doesn't show video, which is something I usually do on an IPad or TV."
It is an Echo show.I cannot get it to do tasks that my older Echo Show did flawlessly. I had a routine set up in my old Show that read the weather in the morning. This won't respond to the weather portion for some reason. It does work though mostly.
"Huge!I'm surprised how much larger the Show 8 is compared to the Show 5. That 3 inches gives you, of course, a much bigger screen but it also increases the size of the enclosure and enriches the sound as well. Happy with this purchase!"
My wife loves it....My wife LOVES having the 8 inch Echo show in the kitchen. She cooks one day a week (2 hours) and she wanted something to watch. She is streaming the entire catalog of the show Frasier and the quality of the picture and sound is fantastic.
Worth the money!Good screen for watching movies bedside or following recipes downstairs in the kitchen. Super fast and easy to use. I recommend the stand that’s sold separately. Makes a world of difference. Overall very satisfied with this product.
"Won't play videos or music.I wanted to love this. I wanted to be able to have Alexa show me YouTube and Amazon music videos while I work or clean, but all I ever get is an error message; despite repeated soft resets, it still won't work. Basically, this is just an expensive echo with with a screensaver."
"Ehhh. Okay I guess.I don’t understand why the echo show 8 doesn’t support the stick up cam battery even when it is online. What if all the previous cameras you’ve purchased are battery operated &amp; not hard wired (which is convenient to move around for strategic reasons)??? This echo show would have been a complete failure! It does not completely serve its purpose.Other than that, the picture &amp; sound quality I guess is okay."
"Not user friendly.Really disappointed in this product. Alexia doesn't help much, she doesn't know answers to simple questions. Google does better.  Product didn't come with instructions &amp; I can't get it to work with my other Amazon stuff like my fire stick. I'm not computer smart &amp; having a hard time with it."
Great Improvement.The new Echo Show 8 is great! Substantial improvement over gen1 Echo Show. The trade-in processes seamless and very easy. The trade-in amount was very generous. Highly recommend the Echo Show 8 and trading in the Gen 1 Echo Show.
Purchased to view our Ring Cameras.We purchased this to be able to view our ring camera's without taking out our phones.We also wanted something to stay on when the kids are in the backyard and we am in the house.  This is PERFECT!!! Just what we needed.  I don't have to keep logging into my phone.
It’s huge !!!!Wow if I realized the echo show 8 was going to be like a iPad on my kitchen island I would have gotten it sooner.  It’s beautifully large for seeing recipes and reading mail.  Just love it.  Glad I added it to my collection of Alexa products
Echo Show 8.I just love my echo show 8. I'm truly glad I picked this up. It's my first echo.The size is just right and the sound is amazing. I would recommend to anyoneI will purchase the swivel stand nextHappy with my purchase ☺
"Great, but a bit clunky.I wanted to search for a recipe, but apparently the search is limited to their own recipe database and not the internet. I haven't used all of the features yet, but found this a bit frustrating. I ended up finding the recipe I wanted on my iPad and  playing music on the Show. It is nice that you can ask Alexa to play a certain playlist or artist, pause, skip, etc. The sound quality is surprisingly decent. I haven't used all of the features yet since it is still relatively new."
"Unique Gift.Several years ago my mother brought me my first echo for the home and I wasn't to if it would benefit us; as it turns out it was one of the best gadgets we ever had, we use it all the time, we now are the proud parents of ""The Tap, Echo, Echo Show and Echo Show 8"". It's easy to communicate with family around the world without paying for airfare and hotel cost, just to spend time."
"Echo Show.I like the ease of setting the unit up, however it was a little difficult when adding echo's throughout the home to integrate the system. When I attempted to do an ""Announcement"" the Echo's were scratchy, but understandable. Also when Bluetooth on Computers are active, Echo show announces so, Not good!"
Choppy speech is frustrating!Looked forward to new echo 8 for improvements..... but alas not to be so!!Returned first purchase for faulty transmission of voice calling. Recipient could understand only every third or fifth word so speech is choppy. Received a replacement same problem. My original 1st generation echo show worked perfectly and we tested the new 8 on five calls to three different echo shows. Same result. Great if all you want is an alexia music box.
"Great product.I like what you can do with it.  I don't like that you have to buy a stand for it, the stand should be included"
Ease of use.Having fun with my new Echo Show 8. I have the Echo Show in the great room and put the Show 8 in the kitchen. Getting in the habit of asking questions and getting great answers. Also use it to control smart home items. Loving it.
"This is a great product for the price!So far, all is working great.  I had to set my contacts individually; however, I liked this better, as I did not want all of my contacts in Alexa.  This way, I can choose who I would be most likely to call.  I can play music through out our house, as I have other Echos.  That is nice.  It gives a multitude of topics and information across the screen that you might be interested in learning more about, and I like that feature.  I haven't used it to video chat yet, but intend to.  Overall, it has exceeded our expectations.  Really enjoy it!"
"Pretty Cool.I got it for integration, like turning on and off lights in the house and seeing my cameras.  My moms 85 and sometimes locks herself out of the house.  I  set up a good morning alert that reads me the weather and traffic, and it will whisper to me if my husband is sleeping.  I am a little disappointed that I can't change the name to ""wiretap."""
Christmas.Pop for myself and one as a Christmas gift to someone as always happy with Alexa products still haven’t done a couple things on it but while I’ve hear from friends that this one’s better than the ones in the past and so far from what I’m using it for it’s working out great
"PERFECT!I absolutley LOVE LOVE LOVE my echo show. when the price  goes down to $80.00 again I will be  buying another for my bedroom. I love how  it attaches to my ring cameras and shows me the view instantly.. , I use it every day!!"
Everything the Echo can do.A simple and great addition to my Echo devices. My first video Echo and I like it. Easily connected to my smart products with a simple setup and the voice commands work flawlessly. Replaced my bedside Echo dot and alarm clock.
"Will not work with Cloud Cam or Arlo!Could not get Show 8 to show cloud cam, an amazon product. Error message was received, not supported. Attempted to pull up Arlo cams, screen would time put it took so long to load. These two “perks” were the only reason it was purchased. Bought two and returned both!!"
I really like it.I love the Show. We have Echos throughout our house but this was our first show. It's on a shelf facing my bed and is great for getting news and controlling my smart home devices. Get a tilt and swivel stand for it to get the best experience.
Great for the value.Product is well made. Voice recognition is spot on. Two suggestions. 1 speakers sounds good. Would be nice if it had a front facing speaker for the sound to come towards you. 2 would be nice if it was capable to set up stereo sound to have another Alexa device pair with it. Sound quality is ok. But to have that wow factor. Any of those suggestions with blankets a wow factor. After all. I'm just comparing it to there othere echo devices.
"Very smart device.Echo Show 8 is excellent!  Easy to set up and VERY intuitive. Music, weather, info, traffic, video clips, recipes or news it does it all!  Highly recommended!  Combined with other Echo units, it will play music throughout the house.  Excellent!"
"Nice device, could be great in the near future.I really like where the Echo Show 8 could end up one day. There are a few little quirks that annoy me, but I think they are probably things that Amazon is working on. I also hope they are working on a customizable clock face."
"I liked the Show 5 but very disappointed in the Show 8.The New Show 8 has ""no Clock options"". It has NO day or date displayed on the Home Screen. The time display is too SMALL.  I have two Show 5's and several Echo Dots. The Show 5 has a Large time display and Day, Date , Local Temp on the Home screen.  The Show 8 was a disappointment.  I will be returning it."
"Love it! Must have for every house!I recieved my Echo Show 8 today. Set up was a breeze, I had it connected and going within minutes and I absolutely love it. The sound quality is great even when playing music or making calls. Very user friendly. I will be purchasing more for all rooms in my house."
"Love the Echo Show 8.I love my Echo Show 8. It's wonderful to see the words for songs and the sound is great. Some say the suggestions bother them, but not me. Really enjoy getting a recipe, saving it, and adding the ingredients to my shopping list."
"Alexa, the knowledgeable, friend voice.I am using this as a bedside clock / entertainment device. It plays music that sounds great. And I can ask any questions of course and get answers. I like being able to ask for the weather for the upcoming days. I love Alexa!"
Love it.I have the Show 5 in my bedroom. I decided to get this one to put in the living room in conjunction with my Ring 2 doorbell. I love the size of it. The sound is awesome and the picture is very clear. I highly recommend it.
Love Alexa.I like the return to a larger screen. I have several Echos and have set up a music group. The pop-up information on-screen has prompted recipe searches and reading practice for my grandchild. I praise every new Echo I get.
"My kitchen companion!!I have this set up in my kitchen. It was easy to set up and connect to my wifi. Love having this in the kitchen to listen to music. It is also set up to my Ring, so I can see who is at the front door. So far this is A+++++"
Pure genius.I like that I can issue a voice command to display any one of 6 Lorex IP cameras at my home. Someone rings the door bell and I can tell alexa to show the front door camera. Listen to Sirius XM...just ask alexa. Pure genius
I Love It!!!!!!!!I Love this..its fantastic. I listen to what I want. I get recipes at a glance with instructions if needed. Reminders and timers and so much more. Thank You Amazon...and wishing every single person at Amazon a Merry Christmas.
"A high quality product with very big potential.Excellent sound quality and video. Alexa interactivity needs lots of work, is often frustrating. Not recommended for vegan/vegetarian due to constant offerings of meat cooking vids. Needs more movie and TV viewing choices."
Great device but lacks video content. Bassy audio.Great device but lack of video content is a bummer. No Netflix or other Prime Video competitors - just Hulu (Ugh!). Also suffers from very bassy audio - like most Echo devices. The equalizer just can't reduce this enough.
LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!I friggin love this!! I was so exited to get it in the mail and i have had it for like 4 days now. I have used it every single day multiple times a day. I am so happy it got this. Just get one you won’t be disappointed!!!
Just OK for video.Does not have a Netflix skill. Often can't find a video on Hulu that I can see on the PC in my hulu account.  Forgets where I left off when I pause a video. Sometimes forgets which episode I was watching and refuses to load it.
"Great screen, the best sound but lacking in some areas.This is a really nice model but there are a few things I'm not to crazy about. I use it to turn on my smart lights but it's honestly lacking in that ability to do it well. I find myself using Google more to control my lights."
"Great speaker for music.We bought the Echo Show for my kitchen but I use it for so many things - I can call my son and daughter and see them without getting on my computer or phone, listen to music with a great speaker, utilize the timer for cooking, play games (I am addicted to Song Quiz) and get up to the minute news and weather.  It is beyond my expectations."
"Sounds great.I'm really surprised by the sound quality. It sounds a lot better than my Sony Dream Machine clock radio and I always thought that sounded pretty good. It can play videos, show web pages and its mic is sensitive enough to not be overpowered by the speaker."
Best Echo yet.I waited a long time before buying the new Echo Show 8 and it was definitely a worthwhile purchase.  My wife loves the ability to see recipes on the bright screen and the sound is even better than our second-generation Echo.
Extremely useful.Outstanding...use it all the time...much better than Alexa..which is amazing itself!I'd get the 10 inch if I could afford it...Sound is better on Alexa...and better yet on 10 inch from what I read
"Love my new Echo Show.My new Echo Show is everything I expected, and I love the fun facts it displays randomly throughout the day.  My only small dislike is that the music quality is just a slight bit less than my Echo, but still outstanding overall."
"Beautiful and versitile.I have other Echo devices, Fire TV and other wifi enabled devices that connect with Alexa.  The Echo Show is a great companion device,  I am still playing with different commands but so far has exceeded my expectations."
Terrible.One word terrible! What a disappointment as a gift. The constant ads are completely unacceptable. Tried every conceivable way to switch the ads off but there is no way to do it!! Why should you pay for a product and then be subjected to constant ads! DO NOT BUY!
"Smart Upgrade.I upgraded from the Echo Show 5 to the 8"" Echo Show and I'm glad I did. Larger display and better sound is worth the upgrade. If your thinking about going from the Echo Show 5 to the 8"" Echo Show or making it an addition, think no longer, you'll be glad you did."
Works great!It works as expected and was easy to set up. Only takes about 5 minutes. I have this placed in my living room so I can control my smart plugs from my couch. I liked it so much that I bought an Echo Show 5 for my bedroom.
"Echo show is awesome.I've had echo dots for years and decided to add the show.  This unit is great!  Set up was easy.  I use the 3.5 mm jack with my home audio system and am very pleased.  Amazon music, SiriusXM, and Pandora offer all the music that I could ask for."
"I Love this......I bought this so that I could see my Mom when I call her so when she says she is fine, I can look at her and see.This works great and my mother can use it very easily.  It also reads her Daily bread to her......."
"Need More Apps!!it's ok, would have great if it had built in apps like Netflix and youtube!! I'm thinking of returning mine, still debating. wish I would have read the reviews and questions/answers before asking My Hubby one for Xmas."
Great device.This was given as a gift to my wife and me.  We have three other echo's in the house.  None of them have a screen like this one.  We really love this one the most.  I can't say enough to indicate how much we like it.  It is a fantastic device.....
I like it and it sounds good.Well if computers are going to replace humans and take over the world.They are going to have to get a helluva lot smarter than alexa...Great sound easy to use but you need the alexa app on a device to set up most things.All in all its prety cool works well.
"A must with Ring.Bought it to view my Ring camera’s.  It makes it much easier to access than using the Ring app. Only disappointment was I didn’t realize I could only view one camera at a time when I got it. My fault for not checking.  Good size, glad I didn’t go for the 5 inch screen.  Music was a nice surprise, you get the lyrics on the screen as the music plays. Will purchase again."
This is AMAZING!!I bought two. One for me and another  for my mom who lives in Missouri. What can’t you do with this device? It works perfectly with Ring and my XM subscription! I connected my YouTube account from the browser section and play music from my playlist. There is so much I can do. Alexa tells me when someone is at my door and when my Amazon packages are due to arrive AND when there is a package at my door!! I’m purchasing another for my sister in law!
Love.The sound is great. The display is clear and bright. Very easy to use and understand.
"Love these.I really like the echo show. I have one in the kitchen that I use for the time, the current weather and recipes. The one in the living room is the Echo Show 8. It is easier to see and read. I would recommend these."
"Lots of entertainment.I like the size of the screen. Lots of entertainment in a small package. The only thing that was a disappointment for me is I thought it had the capability to answer my phone, but I was mistaken. It will answer only from other Amizon devices.  I am able to call out."
Fun addition.Bought several of these at Christmas for me and my siblings. Setup was amazingly simple and was in a video chat with my sister within 10 minutes. There is a couple of things to be aware of. With this device you do not need another echo device in the same room. More than one and they get crossed on some commands. Be aware of what contacts you allow it to upload. Especially if you have your email and social accounts installed on your phone for it has issues with duplicate entries.
"Im in love with Alexa!I purchased the Echo show 5 before I knew they were coming out with an 8! I love both of them. The 8 is in my room and the 5 is in my kitchen.  Alexa runs my house,  Lol!  Love it love it love it!!  Best part,  the 8 has the Hulu app added to it."
"My Elexa.I love the Elexa Show 8. The sound is wonderful, and having the screen is useful for many things. If I need a recipe, I ask Alexa to get me a recipe, and then I have it on the screen there on my counter. I can not only hear, but see the weather report,watch video's. I add my shopping list to my phone, by telling Alexa to add items to my shopping list. The list is endless,as to what I can do!"
"Echo Show the best of all the Echo units.So far the echo show works perfectly. The sound is amazing.  It's being used as a kitchen assistant.Now that I have heard the sound, I would buy the Show instead of other echo units.I give it 5 stars"
"We already bought more.The screen is much larger than the Show 5, and the sound is FAR superior.  It connected in less than a minute &amp; connected to Ring and our home security cameras with ease.  My wife uses this for music, timer in the kitchen, recipes &amp; to monitor the baby.  We love it &amp; already bought more for other rooms"
Echo 8.I really liked how when the song plays it also shows the lyrics. Can sing along and know the true words to song. Really fun. Also when a package is delivered to your home the echo will tell u. Really a great feature.
"Echo Show 8.Okay, so it still gives completely incorrect responses to my questions sometimes, but over all has a 95% accuracy.  Sound quality can be a bit bass heavy, but overall okay. I do love how it integrates with my Ring doorbell and my smart thermostat."
Great display and sound quality.Great display and picture quality.  Great feature to turn off the microphone and disable the camera when not needed.  The sound is also very good for the size of the unit.  Great upgrade from an Amazon Echo dot.
"I love it!It was a gift from my son and daughter in law.  I have my SiriusXM on it, watch movies, use it as a timer, and check upcoming Amazon deliveries.  It is in my kitchen and I plan to purchase a second one for my craft room upstairs."
ok.Can't get rid of the ads.  Can't watch netflix.  Most of the time it doesn't understand what I am saying. Works fine for music. I unplug it when not in use.  That takes care of the recording and camera.....Downloaded my gmail but can't see it.
"Happy with the purchase!I did the trade in program and updated all of my echo devices. I had a 1st gen echo in my living room and I enjoyed the sound quality. I wasn’t sure what to expect with the show8, but I’m pleasantly surprised."
"Almost perfect.It would be nice, if it would have a tweeter as well, to be easier to understand what Alexa is saying. It is to much bass. Same goes for the Dot as well.Voice recognition seems more sensitive on the dot."
"She's a hit in our house.We love our show 8, nice large display the sound is awesome. Goes great with our prime membership music and ordering. She recognizes voices amazingly well. Sports scores,weather,news,recipes , answers questions fairly well."
"Setup was a Breeze.I was amazed how easily it set itself up. I entered my Amazon sign on and password and it found all my devices by itself. I have a ring2, a Front door lock and my nest Thermostat. It found them all and they are all responding to my voice commands.Love it"
"Everyone needs an Echo Show 8.The Echo Show 8 is a must have! Need a reminder to take your medicine, make a shopping list and other lists, listen to Amazon music with great sounding speakers, ask Alexa to turn your lights off and on when they are plugged into smart plugs, call people on your contact list, link your phone’s calendar, ask Alexa for recipes and see them on the screen, use your own pictures as wallpaper. The Echo Show 8 is stylish, practical and a great addition to my kitchen countertop."
"Great device.Purchased this to supplement my Ring 2 door bell.  The ring app enabled on Echo Show notifies me anytime there is movement at the door, plus I can view the video from the Ring.  I upgraded from the Echo Spot."
"Alexa fan.I am an Alexa fan! I added the Echo Sow 8 to the family of echo products in my home; 2 Dots, Echo 1st generation, and Echo auto.  I am pleased with how the Echo Sow 8 looks and performs.  I also gifted two Echo Show 5 to my son and daughter on Christmas.  They like their Echoes and we did our first video call and I have to say that it was as if they were in the same room.  The video was smooth and we didn’t have any problems while we visited.  From watching videos on prime to checking the weather, Alexa is a great addition to our home."
"2nd best on the market the best one is a 10"" I have both.Got it as a Christmas get to make a small one in my bedroom to hook up to my home stereo as Bluetooth speaker that came with it works great but I hear it a lot better in Bluetooth on my home stereo for music"
"Awesome Device.I love the Echo Show 8 - HD 8"" smart display with Alexa it has great sound a good sized screen and I love Alexa. My only complaint would be the lack of a Hub but for the price I guy you can't get everything."
"Best gift.Since we got Echo as a gift, there hasn’t been a day we haven’t used it. So much you can do from checking the weather, listening to music, looking up recipes as you cook plus much much more! Definitely would recommend for the whole family!"
"Great upgrade from the Echo5.Love this upgrade from my Echo5. The bigger size makes such a difference and the sound is great. Love everything about it. The reason for only 4 stars is just like everyone else complained of - why can't Amazon get rid of their ""suggestions""? Don't they know by now that no one wants them?"
"Awesome Sound Quality.I already had the Echo Dot prior to purchase so I wasn't expecting that great of speaker quality. However, after playing music on it I was so surprised by how much better these perform. I have had a few Bluetooth speakers in the past and none of them compare to the quality the Echo Show 8 gives."
"Love My Echo Show 8.Absolutely love it.  It was incredibly easy to set up, it integrated perfectly with all of our other Echo’s, it works perfectly as a “slideshow” frame for our Amazon Photos, the sounds quality is unbelievably good, and I could go on and on. I could not be happier with this device."
Voice commands can be impossible!Alexa seems to prefer accessing Amazon music however we have tried and failed to access Spotify for specific music. That is a problem for us since we have a Spotify account and we have music on that site. Alexa has difficulty accessing Apple podcast specific episodes. I am always very specific in my requests only to have Alexa give me a song or podcast I didn’t ask for. It always seems to default to country music too when it can’t find what you are asking for. Bummer!
"Decent sound quality and videos ok to watch on an 8” device.Much nicer than the Echo 5, but suffers same fate as all Shows; struggles with lack of deeply integrated video content because it basically still thinks it’s a voice-only device! Not too much to do with it. Yet."
Mostly happy with it.I would rate it higher but I hate that annoying suggestion at the bottom of the screen. I read that there is no way to get rid of it but someone said to just put a strip of black tape over it so I may try that. Sad that you have to diminish the screen size like that. I also don’t like that I can access Hulu and Amazon Prime but not Netflix. The sound quality is nice and clear and the picture clarity is beautiful.
Could behave better integration with iphone.Like it a lot for showing Prime videos but disappointed it won’t play video from my iphone... plays audio but no image! Also disappointed no lightening connector for iPhone built in.  Has android mini usb.
"Just the right size - with incredible sound.I got this for the spouse to run thunderstorms at night.  Who would have guessed how good of sound quality would have been included in such a small system.  Great screen.  Great sound.  Easy to use, and a mainstay in the home.  I know that there is an Echo 10, but this is the right size for me."
"Great sound.Great sound from the speakers, but if the volume is maxed out, it has a hard time hearing any voice commands. other than that I love it. I have the show 5 too and can't believe how much bigger this one is."
Good but missing the clock.I was a bit disappointed that the full screen clock and the change the clock face function was removed from the operating system.The show 5 has it and can’t for the life of me why it would be removed as a function. One of the purposes for a larger screen would logically be a larger clock. I hope the developers will add a fix to put it back in.
An excellent aid for every day life.What's not to like. Alexa is a household name. She is the assistant my wife and I need on a daily basis. She gives us the news and weather. She is a dictionary and encyclopedia. She is our calendar and our reminder.
"Horrible!The skills are really bad, no videos to watch other than cooking. If you use silk be careful because is very bugy and do not ingrate good. I cannot watch any sports. I bought it because I want to watch sports while I do breakfast or cook. Bad decision it do not work for that purpose. No espn, fs1 or any video streaming platform for sports. I open xfinity on silk web browser and it does not work."
Need better camera!!!!!Not sure why amazon cheap out on the camera on these devices echo show.  These need the camera from FB portals and it wide angle lense!  Sound and screen is good but camera is only 1MP.  Portal has 13MP with AI zoom!
"Works well learns faster than me!Alexa has added humor to my day.  From smart lights to ""ring: doorbell It enhances controlling daily device.  The sound is unbelievable.  I can see endless uses.  Should have started sooner using smart devices.  Alexa makes a great interface."
Another great step forward for Alexa.I'm an Alexa fan and this one is great. I as of this review still haven't used all the features but I will say it's a step up in sound quality and visual quality than the VEW I bought a couple years ago.
Great to Keep in Touch with.Love the Echo Show.  Sometimes it doesn't know which number you are telling it to call and sometimes it freezes when you are talking with someone.  But these things wouldn't stop me from getting it again.
"Fun to use.It's great to video chat with family; however, I'm concerned about it being hacked and remotely turned on; therefore, I put a cloth over the screen at night and keep the camera turned off unless in use."
"The size.Thank you Amazon, this is the best Echo that I have bought, I have bought them all, this Echo Show 8 is all around the best, sound, picture, size, camera for face time etc etc etc, I love ❤️ ❤️❤️❤️❤️ it"
"Great addition to the household.Don’t know why it’s taken us so long to get Alexa with a screen. Our whole house is Alexa’d up and this has been a great addition. Voice recognition could be better but for the most part, it’s all stars"
"How did I live without this.So happy to have this large screen.  The speakers are amazing and can be heard perfect in my open kitchen living room which makes cleaning a lot easier.  The only this I miss is Alexa beeping when I wake her, now I have to look to see if the bar is lit I bet there is a setting for it so I'll go ask her nowm"
"Great....except.Everything was great, until the video stopped working.  Bought this so my elderly mother could video chat and i could ""drop in"" and check on her.  Within a few days, her video stopped working.  She could see me, but I could not see her.  NOT helpful.  I wasted a lot of time trying to fix it...re-booting, settings, etc.  I finally did a factory reset.  I hope this does not happen again.  I did some research and apparently this happens often enough that I am stunned that Amazon hasn't fixed the problem."
Perfect size.Love the show8 ….a perfect companion to your Ring doorbell
"The Echo Show 8 is very simple to setup and use.I have only had the Show 8 for a limited time. I like the fact that when the room is dark that it dims itself. I easily downloaded photos to rotate as wallpaper in the background. It allows me to turn on the lights in my dark bedroom with a simple command. There are many more features that I sincerely like. The one thing that I would like to see them change, like most other reviewers, is the continuous scrolling at the bottom of the screen."
"Crappy sound.This is a fun toy, and can be a helpful thing, but I can't understand most of what Alexa says, and music quality is lousy.  I've played with the audio equalizer settings, with only minimal improvement."
Easy integration with Ring devices.Easy integration with my other devices. Also with my Ring cameras and door bell. Since I have 4 other Alexa enabled devices an alert from the Ring cameras sends an alert message throughout the house.
"Open/Close camera feature is great!I bought several of these for my grandkids and me. So far, it's been wonderful being able to chat with them from afar. I love being able to share in special moments, look up recipes, play music, etc."
Fill sound and display.The sound was better than what I expected. It sounds very nice with a full sound. Not tinny at all. The mic is not as sensitive as my previous echo. it would be nice to change what type of news appears on the home screen. Very happy with my purchase.
Big improvement to the original Echo Show.Replaced an original Echo Show in the Kitchen.  The new Echo Show 8 screen and sound quality are a huge improvement to the original. We also got two Echo Show 5s for our bedroom nightstands. Love them all!
"Must Own Device.This device is so much fun and has so many uses. Recommended in every household. Works as TV, speaker, intercom, digital photo frame, plays music and pretty much anything else you can think of. Must own."
"Echo Show exceeds expectations.We weren’t sure about having an Echo Show in  our house, but we love being able to have extensive visits with our kids who live in California.  And the quality of the music is just terrific.  So we decided to get an Echo for other parts of the house.  Get one!"
"not much guidance.Received it a bit delayed compared with Amazon stds.  Sort of challenging to figure out.  Still developing it's ""skills"", etc.  But was able to link it to my calendar (sort of) and contacts.  Nice screen.  Seems like you have to sync it up with a phone ""app"" of alexa.  Sort of links to pc but... not really. ?"
"Great Christmas present!I like being able to see the display from across the room.  Use it mainly for music, very good sound.  Also really like being able to edit shopping list on the display, instead of having to go to my phone or computer.  I've also loaded family pictures on it and enjoy seeing them change."
"Amazung.Works really well. Owned a Google home prior, but the Alexa integration and communicating between Alexa devices is too useful to pass up. The screen Is very bright and clear and is very pleasing on the eyes."
Clear sound.I've had an Echo Show for a long time. Finally upgrade to an Echo Show 8. And I'm glad I did the picture is clear the sound sounds better than my old one. And no more glitches. Glad I upgraded. Thank you Amazon
"better screen and sound.love most everything...sound quality, looking at my photos, video chatting, videos,etc.  alarm wakes to light first then sound.  yes the suggestions are VERY distracting.  overall very happy though"
Very good.This is our first echo and we like it very much. We like how easy it is to make lists and then view them at the store on phone. Music sounds very good and screen size is good for even going on web.
"Frustrated.Very disappointed in this device. I wanted a clock for my bedroom that I could also play music and get the weather, news etc... the sound is great when it works. I’ve had it 2 days and already had to contact support 2 times with the same complaint.  Alexa does not reply to my commands and when she does it loops and stops... I’ve tried unplugging the device and it works for a while but stops again. It’s so frustrating when you are listening to a great inspiring story and then you can’t hear the ending. I’m probably going to return the device."
Works great!The show is fantastic! The screen looks great and the sounds is surprisingly good. My only issue is the lack of a shortcuts. I wish there was a better or easier shortcut to cycle through the apps.
"TRY ""Alexa, you failed and I wish I could give you zero stars"".Amazon has decided they don't care what customers think and chose to not allow us to disable the constant self-promotion of Try hints.  Shame on you Amazon.It's a nice screen, looks just like I had hoped, but has a non-stop advertisement for themselves running right in my living room.  Terrible."
"Works great!Voice commands work really good. You can pretty much tell it to do anything you want and it works. Also works great with my Ring door bell, ring cameras and my nest thermostat. Good sound quality."
Show 8 is amazing.Amazon thank you our show 8 came before Christmas which was suppose to be after christmas. We have the show 5 and the show 8 is amazing our show 5 is going to our office so we can have our amazon Alexa all the time now.
"Easy to set up, easy to use.Bright, clear. Easy to set up, easy to use. The sound is very good and the microphones are strong enough to be heard anywhere in the room. This is a huge step up from my old first generation Echo."
It works.What I didn’t care for was the line on the bottom as far as I’m concerned when you buy something you don’t want to pay for advertising I managed to get rid of it 99% of the time otherwise I think this show is going to do exactly what I want when I get used to it
"Features are very usable to the average cosumer.Lots of features that are good for the average purchaser.  Only complaint I have is the ability to turn of the ""Try Alexa"" prompts across the bottom of the screen.  Unable to turn this feature off."
"Keeps me in touch with my sister!I received this as a Christmas gift from my sister who lives several hours away.  She has one and sent me one!  What a blast!  My internet speed can make it kinda wonky sometimes, but that is not the Echo's fault.  Thanks Sis!!  LOL"
It works great I just don't like the little notes on the bottom.How many thing I do not like about this is you can not remove the lettering at the bottom it's always having something on it no matter what I turn on or turn off pisses me off for the money you pay
"Good ""in between"" size Echo Show.I really like the 8 inch diagonal screen for my office. I have used the Show 5 there, but that works better as a smaller alarm clock type use. I have the larger Show for our kitchen, and that is too large - the  Show 8 is ""just right"" for my office. By the way, I have it play music via an Echo Link to high quality powered monitors &amp; sub for excellent sound while I work in the office. Great set-up!"
"Why can't we have all 3 Shows do the same thing?When my favorite likes is the Sound... Great volume, but could use a little more highs.  I have the echo show 5, 8 and 10. And the one thing that aggravates me the most. Is they do not all have the same capability. Amazon all 3 these products should be able to use the clocks the features the same way. Really need to get that update started. It's like you have 3 different departments working on 3 the same projects."
"Fatal flaw.As with other reviewers, I've tried everything to turn off the annoying ""Alexa, try...."" display at bottom of screen. The ""do not disturb' acts for awhile but then it returns when weather or some other action ensues.  Small screen and this text takes up space!  This obvious and glaring user unfriendly behavior drops my rating to 1. Maybe Amazon will act if their sales are impacted?"
"Vibrant, beautiful display, but.......Just recently received this and still exploring all the capabilities and options, but by FAR the most annoying problem is the CONSTANT running display across the bottom of the screen, ""Try Alexa...………….."".  This COULD be a useful feature if you were looking for suggestions, and the only thing missing which would make this a 5-star rating is the option to SHUT IT OFF and enjoy the photos or whatever other content you CHOOSE to display.  Amazon, PLEASE develop a software fix, because this is almost a deal-breaker."
"A great addition to an aging mind.This device is a great addition for my aging forgetfulness. Reminds me to take my pills, and wakes me when I need to get up early. Alexa is good company. I like it so much I bought another one."
Sucks!We bought this to show our Nest cameras.  We have no idea how to integrate the Nest cameras with the Echo show.  The nest cameras work great with our IPhones and iPads but not with the Exho show.  Big disappointment.
User Friendly.I am a long time owner of several Echo devices. I did not think I needed one with a screen. I am pleasantly surprised at how nice it is to have visuals that go along with the Alexa voice. It makes several of the skills more user friendly.
"VERY NICE.I have two 1st edition Echo Shows. The Echo Show 8 has a larger screen with a much better screen resolution.  And, the sound quality is much better. A nice improvement over the 1st Echo Show."
"Fix the firmware !I received mine today. I am pleased with the display, the sound, display and other things. But the thing I don't like is there in no way you can not turn off the ""Try Alexa, to do this or thing like that. I also have the Show 5 ant the firmware in it is much better then the Show  8. I am thinking about returning my 8 and get another 5 for this reason .  I have seem many reviews complainning about this issue. Get your engineers busy to fix the firmware and soon. It will increase sales to the Show 8 over the 5."
Really like the larger screen.We have 2 Echo Show 5's and just received the Echo Show 8. We use it in the kitchen as the larger screen is easier to read recipes. The sound quality is better than the Echo Show 5. Overall we really like this unit. Would purchase again.
"Plugs are too large.Plugs are so large that I cannot charge my other devices.  Many of the plugs in my kitchen bathroom and bedroom have plug that also have 2 USB charging ports but I cannot use the charging ports when a Show 8 or Echo Dot is plugged in.  The old Echo Dots did not require a plug.  They were convertable, meaning that you could use USB to power the devces or sick the USB into the standard plug provided with each device in order to provide power.  This applies to most of Amazon's other newer devices unfortunately."
"Echo Show 8 is as good as advertised.Our experience is consistent with the CNET review that indicated the Echo Show 8 is a ""sweet spot"" in the show lineup. Speakers are good for a great room and Alexa recognition and response is good for the whole family.  We subsequently purchased additional units for three other family members who are equally enjoying their Echo Show 8's."
"it works.Good Assistant , order the book to learn more"
Nice item but could use Improvement.Love how it works fantastic item for the price but I wish it would work with the wyze camera better than what it does.  myView of the camera shuts off after 5 minutes I have to tell the Echo Show 8 to turn back on my camera to view it. I wish you can set that to stay on the screen in settings
Can't turn off anoying suggestions on botton of screen.I really would like to love this but the constant try 'Ask suggestions on the bottom of the screen just annoy the heck out of me.  I tried everything to turn them off but to no avail.+
"Convenience, lighting control.We are still getting acquainted. Very pleased with the product. The show has been added to existing Echo family including Dot, Auto and Smart Plugs, plus smart microwave that started it all."
"What a great combination.One for the kitchen, common areas of the house, and one for your bedroom nightstand.  You can make announcements throughout your home or play the same music from each Echo Show at the same time.  Let's face it.  After you've used it once you can't get along without it."
"Work great with Foscam IP Cameras.For now I am only using to monitor security cameras, connects 8 Foscam cameras via Foscam cloud apps and Foscam skill and it works great, wish they show day and date at the home screen and drop the suggestion."
"WOW!!  Outstanding in EVERY  respect!Just received the Show, and after only a day's use, couldn't be happier!  The sound is absolutely superb, and the features are impressive.  I'll update this review in a few weeks.  So far,I couldn't be happier!"
Echo for Skype.Got this for my mom to be able to do Skype.  It had an issue the second call she tried to use it with no microphone. Rebooted unit and it worked as designed.  We are still on a learning curve
"Incredible sound quality!!Sound quality is so good, I replaced my Bose SoundTouch with the Echo on my kitchen counter. Saved a lot of counter space, and although the display is beautiful, wish there was a larger Echo Show for our older eyes!😉"
Excellent Device.Nothing not to like. Great design. Great picture. Excellent sound for a small design.Does a great deal of skills and runs flawlessly.Like the larger screen particularly for reading recipes while cooking
"Ads to total home intrigation.Make video chat first, control lights ad see Canada's. I find it to be an excellent addition to my home. Would recommend it to anyone. I do not mind the advertisement as I just ignore it."
"Love the echo show 8.I have the echo show 5, I wanted the 8 inch echo show for the bedroom. My roommate had a leg cut off and I can drop in and check on him when I am gone for a while, it a excellent product."
"Much more than just another digital assistant!Screen Is much bigger than I thought it would be, nice HD display and touch screen works great. Very convenient acces to all media (music and video) by pullout screen that also provides you with a web browser/Silk.Audio quality very nice and video quality as well, I had an echo spot and this clearly recognizes my voice much better and seems to Understand and suggest more. It is also more polite I noticed"
"I'm impressed with the amount of integrations.I'm a multi assistant user. But by far, Alexa has the best and most complete integrations from all three leaders. I was able to sync all my cameras and security system under one single screen."
Great product!Bought this for my son and he loves it. He has to repeat commands a lot but that is probably due to the face he is 4 :) he uses it to turn on his night light and to have dance parties in his room! FreeTime is great as it will limit those dance parties to just about what I can handle (1 hour)
"Very cool addition to the Alexa/echo family.Very cute and love having it in my kitchen. Sound quality is really good! Some of the voice commands are a learning curve. For example, you have to ask Alexa to open prime video before asking her to play a movie etc. The music lyric feature is fun and finding new skills is cool too."
Great addition to our home security.Setup was super easy.  Connected to our home Ring security so at the ease of a command we can view any of our cams.  Very easy to program for your home screen and info that is displayed.
"echo will do it all!nothing to dislike. Great product. Works beautifully! I have an echo in every room. Love how it now has security for the house, when I am away. My busiest echo is the one in the kitchen."
"Great product but leaves alot to be desired.I use my Alexa in my bedroom for my morning routine (alarm, weather, ect). I was using the speaker previously which I liked alot and decided to get the show to ENHANCE my routine and move the speaker to the living room. The problem is my Show doesn't say what time it is or the weather. Make my routine harder actually because I have to stop what I'm doing to read a screen. Long story short my speaker was doing a better job assisting me in the morning than the show because it read the results back to me."
Good quality &amp; functionality.This is an addition to an echo show 5 for another room. I am very satisfied with the quality &amp; functionality of both. Their prime function is to monitor my external ring camera activity.
"Perfect.This is great! It is the perfect size and I programmed it to control the lights, heat/air, and to give me the weather and news every morning and evening. I integrated it with several Echo dots so it provides surround sound for my entire, one level home. Super happy with it!"
"High quality.This Alexa is a bargain.  Of particular interest is the fact it now includes a shutter to cut off the camera, something that should be of great interest to anyone concerned about privacy."
"Upgrade from Echo.Upgraded from the echo 2nd generation and love it. Alot of the questions I ask are general and already scrolling across the screen (weather, scheduled events) . Definitely worth the investment."
Not as tall as old one. better screen than 1st gen.I had the echo show 1st generation it was very good.  The new one microphones are to far back on unit don't always hear me. The speakers should be in front and one in the back for bass.
Best Alexa Echo yet.Nice compact yet easily viewed display. Seems smarter all the time. Comes in white &amp; black so I got one for kitchen and bedroom.  Camera and microphone can be manually shut off. Great sound.
"Perfect companion to Alexa.Very pleased with the Echo Show  8! Easy setup,  easy integration and very responsive to voice commands. Have listened to music,  watch a movie, saved recipes and checked the weather!."
Great Size.This was a Christmas gift -I had a regular Echo already but I lovethis one because of the picture.When you ask her to play a song you can read the words that are displayed.
"Ask your show,So ha ha ha.""Try, tell me a pirate  joke"", so zany! Are there no fart jokes?  The nation has been hoping for months.  Try this and that. I try everything day and night to avoid the hammer solution to TRY that AMZ forces down our throats to the point of suffocation.  Do you have staff that reads reviews.  The people do not want this. Fix this!"
"Good Bass.I really like the Echo Show 8! Has a great speaker with good sounding bass with no rattling sounds! I like the Echo Show 8 over my 10.  I use it all the time for music,  I am happy i purchased this!"
Great sound But....Great if your going to use it for a Bluetooth speaker. The echo show Hd 8 is useless unless you want to purchase all these Amazon subscriptions. But I must say the speaker sound quality is amazing.
"I like!I’ve had a number of Echos and liked all of them, this is just a new step.  I need one that also makes coffee and serves breakfast.  Keep working on it, you are doing a terrific job."
"Great addition to our house.We received this as a gift from the kids for Christmas. We're still learning all the functions, but it's been a fun process. My husband especially loves it, he's quite the tech geek."
Great device.Love this device it offers all kinds of tips recipes weather on music songs puts words kind like your own karaoke machine lots of fun will do anything an echo dot will do we love this
Disappointing.To many ads. Doesn't work with my ring.
Like the whole concept but doesn't hear me well.I like how it looks in the idea of the whole thing. But I don't like is  I have to holler for it to recognize my voice. Other than that which is pretty important to me this could be pretty cool to have. Not sure if I will keep. I'm debating.
"Works great.Works great - needs other people to have one so you can talk between them, but the functionality is great.  We use it for picture slideshows similar to the old digital picture frames"
DON'T GIVE UP 🤔.AT FIRST I WAS VERRY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE SERVICE I WAS EXPERIENCE HOWEVER IT CHANGED FROM  1 TO 5.I WAS AMAZED WITH THE TURNAROUND AWESOME SERVICES I RECEIVED .THANK YOU AMAZON.🧜‍♀️
Excellent Device.I absolutely love my Show 8.  It does what I need it to and then some. Alexa's voice is clear and not annoying.  The music sound is of good quality...This was the right purchase for me!!
"Don't see a compelling reason to buy.I bought this expecting that echo show and ring doorbell will seamlessly work together but echo show doesn't show the video when ring doorbell is pressed, it just announce some at door and even that also is random, sometime works sometimes not. It looks to me as a half baked product.Don't recommend."
You Must Get One !Super Awesome I bought one for the wife and my daughter now the grandkids can call us from their house anytime they want super easy to use Amazon does most of the set up for you sound is incredible
"Solid Product.The echo is a great addition to our speakers. The sound is amazing (given the price).We keep ours in the kitchen for recipes, news and music along with a shopping list."
"I like it but it's not very smart.I have an echo Dot but wanted the echo show for the screen to use with my ring.For this purpose the show is great but her voice recognition is not that good and I have to repeat myself a lot, also I ask many question and she gives me the won't answers or directs me to things that I didn't say, and my echo Dot worked way better so I'm a bit disappointed.  However, I understand there's a learning curve for her."
"New friend in the kitchen.I love that device! Answering question of the day became my daily routine. Love the reminders from my calendar, listening to Audiobooks or music while cooking, recipes on hand and so much more. And all without touching the screen."
"Size matters - in this case screen size.I really like my Echo Show 5 but the Echo Show 8 raises the bar even higher. With the larger screen you get themes and more customization than just the clock faces with the Echo Show 5. But where the real difference is noticed for me is when I am viewing my cameras, the larger screen makes it much easier to view camera feeds."
"Luv the screen size.Luv the screen size., Very clear, and delivers a clear voice. Very easy to set up. Luv it. I will buy another one for upstairs use. Right now all I have upstairs is the echo spot."
Perfect.I Absolutely love it not to bulky. Really good sound . I have to second gen as well. I love them both.
"My granddaughter loves it.My granddaughter asked for Echo 8 for her birthday.  She absolutely loves it.  She can watch shows, listen to her music, make announcements throughout the house.  In fact, my son liked it so much he bought one for his son and his wife for christmas so now everyone has one!  Very easy to set up and use!"
Great kitchen size.Great for the kitchen.  Easy to see and read recipes from the screen.  It also a good size for the ring door bell.  The stand is a must have if you want easy of tilt.  We had the amazon paired clock in the kitchen we have moved the paining to the echo show 8.  I love to set multiple timers in the kitchen.  Now it’s very handy to set timers.  The screen size is large enough that you could watch a show or movie while in the kitchen.
Best value for money.Had a Show 5 and upgraded to this during the BF sale. Great sound and excellent picture quality.
"Alexa Echo Show 8 is pretty neat.I was introduced to Alexa Echo at my daughter's home.  I just like that I can use different commands, easy to use.  I'm just learning how to use it right now, but so far so good."
"Very Easy to Use.I received the Echo Show 8 as a gift and was not sure what it could do.  Since then, I've been very impressed with all of its features and I feel like I am just beginning to explore all the things that it can do.  I love it."
My new favorite device.Scrolling news and items of interest. Nice display. Great with movie reviews. Local radar. Reactive brightness display. Ring responsiveness. Wasn't expecting to like it this much
Fun item.This has great voice recognition and the display has very good definition. Definitely did not need this but I am very glad I bought this as it is a very handy and fun assistant.
"Most Useful New Addition for my Day.I am still learning how to best use my echo show. It improves my day. From my bed I can see a family picture with the date and temperature. After my request for a wake up time, I enjoy music. The sound is excellent and the words to the song show on my screen. I can ask Google questions as I usually ask from my phone.  I love this tool."
"Great sound but needs some voice recognition work!The speaker is GREAT. But the voice recognition needs some work. Alexa needs some work. She doesn't seem to be able to search like a Google database. I'm not asking her to do anything special but when I ask for r&amp;b songs and she clearly plays pop songs, it's a problem. So, there's some work to do but when you create your own playlist and connect your smart plugs, everything works WONDERFULLY!!!"
Nice rich sound and clear display.Love the view don't like that I can only stream amazon music to one device at a time unless I pay higher subscription plan so will be dropping music plan and just use my free pandora.
Makes a great addition to kitchen.Just love the echo 8. The larger screen which makes movies look so much better.  Always wanted an echo in kitchen and this is great. The best is able to ask Alexa about recipes.
Alexa for the whole family.The Echo Show is a great addition to our home.  The voice recognition is great as Alexa has even learned to understand our 3 year old!  Seeing the camera views from our Ring is very helpful as well.
"Basic functions.Does most of what you would expect such as voice commands for information, turning on lights, etc.  Biggest negative is you cannot pair with Echo Show 5 in another room to play the same music at the same time.  You are given a procedure to do so but does not work."
Bigger screen and better sound.I only gave it 4 stars due to the fact that I can't change the clock face. I do have the Echo 5 and i can change the face and theme with no problem. The 8 doesn't have that option.
Picture quality is excellent.Easy to set up.Picture display outstanding and simple to load photos to it.The voice sounds like a muffled bass voice.Still figuring out some of the settings.
"Nice gadgets.Very nice .... I just wish we can use the video calling not only for those who have alexa show but also for those who have regular phone with camera access. But overall, Alexa do her job as commanded"
Life just got more fun.So far everything is great. Set up easy. Works all my smart home applications. Works great with my ring cameras. Very happy. I don’t have any issues. Screen size and appearance. My husband loves all the photos that display  on the slide show and has been using to display recipes.
"We like it.Great speaker, clear picture. Could be more user friendly. But device still needs alot work to use apps with it."
I'm about to smash this device it's so frustrating.She doesnt respond to me when I call her name and when I ask a question she doesnt understand so she cant answer I ask her to set the alarm she repeats the time but doesnt set the alarm
Only have had a couple weeks but works very nice.Does not know much for my area. Says it is still learning the area? Turns plugs with light on and off great. Music sounds much better than clock radio. I like it. Great for weather in morning and she seems very polite. No attitude! Lol!
No difference from first gen.The echo show 8 isn't all that different from the first echo show. The only complaint I have is that Amazon pulled a bait and switch and didn't honor the trade in offer for my first gen echo show. This will be my last echo device.
"Very pleased! Love it.Great product, love the screen size and the size of the device. Try Alexa line doesn't bother me at all. No different than TV which shows the channel name in the lower corner.  After a while you don't even notice it is there."
So much better than google hub.Love these devices. I prefer this over the google hub as the google hub isn’t as good as these shows. I’m going to sell my hub bc this is just better and I have my whole house on Alexa
"Sound is great!In comparison with ""OK Google""  Google has better answers faster.  But at the after dinner sofa, asking Alexa is much easier.  Will consider one for the bedroom as an alarm clock."
A New One!I have several Echo’s I have bought the last few years and was ready for a new one.  This one hits it out of the park!  It can do a lot more than I realized and am very happy.
"Make friendly useable for them too.I like that I can use Good and he can read the Lyrics, what I don’t like is that my nephew can’t use it without help need to make it, or make more friendly to deaf mute with hearing aids that can’t say The words as clear"
Great product!Have to say I love the HD screen. I enjoy playing the games and asking questions getting recipes but most of all I enjoy the fact of keeping in touch with friends and family!
"Good Little Device!A great device for the money. Especially during Black Friday! Perfect when used on your night stand. Good picture, sound and integrates well into your echo system. I would buy again for sure!"
"Great!I've really liked this a lot so far. I use it for smart home features, weather, recipes music... etc. Having the recipes on the screen is really nice. I don't think I will be using a paper cookbook much anymore."
All the things you can use Alexa for.The Ring cameras. It was confusing to use this with Alexa.  I didn’t know you had to set it up on your phone or tablet to use.  It took a few tries but I did get it working.
I just isn't that useful.I like the sound quality.  I don't like that it doesn't work like a fire tv - there is no reason why this can't be integrated into this which would make it much more useful.
"Nice improvement from previous generation Show's.I traded in my 1st Gen echo show for the show 8.  The screen looks good the sound is much better offering a more balanced tone. This unit fits our house decor much better than the bulky box it replaced. The only grip I have about the echo show 8 is the voice recognition, it does not pick up Alexa nearly as well other devices. It has to be repeated several time and at an elevated level even in a quiet room."
Frustrating.Unfortunately buying this has ruined my setup for all 5 of my echo dots. It’s been over a week and amazon has yet to fix the problem or come up with a solution. It is so frustrating. And now that the glitch has happened even if I disconnect the echo show the dots still have a glitch. You cannot use 2 dots at the same time! One always shuts the other off. If I would have known I would have never bought it.
"Listening skills lacking, otherwise a good product.I like the screen. I like the advanced qualities. What I don’t like is that the Echo Show is hard of hearing. The Echo dot was much better at hearing commands. That’s been my biggest issue so far."
"Difficult to sync to with my android contacts list.Nice little product, but,  I wanted to use it as a skype substitute.  Having to add contacts individually, by hand, is a cumbersome and needless process.  What to do  .... what to do?"
Great product at sale price!The voice recognition struggles sometimes however works great as a timer and morning wake-up device. The sound quality is OK although not as good as my 2nd generation Echo...
"Love my Echo Show 8.Traded in my original echo show for echo show 8.  Was surprised that the screen is larger but the unit is smaller. Love the new features,.  It integrated seamlessly into my system with no problems."
I am enjoying it.I have my Echo in my kitchen.  I am enjoying the variation of information it keeps giving me.  I also enjoy the various suggestions it gives me to ask it.  I also enjoy the Emails I get with information and ideas what to use it for.
Good size.Good size for a clock and photos. Speaker is good for music. Haven’t tried to watch movie or prime on it but wouldn’t  really want to. It would be good if we could use apps like pandora or YouTube  on the touchscreen.
"Needs A Bigger Clock.Pros: its well designed, great display and the speakers are amazing.Cons: Voice recognition is not as good as my first gen echo making it difficult to find books and music. Amazon Music App can't stream to the Echo show without error and the clock is way too small.Overall its great aesthetically but the software needs work."
"Alexa Show 8.Purchased this for my legally blind Mom. She is able to activate her TV, see pictures, call people &amp; create lists. She is also having fun with the other features. Weather, jokes, questions, sports &amp; so much more. She is LOVING IT!!"
"The design of the clock comes in many options, including large numbers such as bed alarm clocks.I really liked the new device.  the spectacular sound quality.  The uses of the app are very good.  But I think that in the case of the clock, for example, there is no option qdo echos 5 where you can configure the desing of the clock.  for example in the standby option the clock is small and white in color.  I'd love to look at my device and see the clock with larger red numbers like on the bed alarm clocks.  because I use this version of echos 8 in my room."
"Best value of all the Shows - far better than 5.We have a Show 5 and a Show 8. The 8 is far superior in reliability, sound quality, and features. It just seems much more intuitive. 8 is a clear winner and great value!!"
"Need to disable “things to try”....Amazon, are you listening?Love the size, the sound quality, all the handy things Alexa does for me...keeping lists, reminders, music, radio stations.  Would give it 5 stars if I could turn off “things to try” and customize the clock face.  Beyond irritating, will probably return unless they update this soon."
"Video conferencing is almost there.Love the fact that I can “drop in” on my brother at his house. I don’t know if it was the internet or Alexa, but there is still some “digitalizing” of the sound and a few missed words or something, but the rest was great Video was pretty clear and bright. Otherwise, it gives you what you would expect from an echo."
"Love to see what Alexa says.Like the fact we can see what is on the screen  very useful for creating lists, seeing artists name when playing music. Has a nice selection of backgrounds when not in use. Don’t like that the background screen turns dark after awhile."
Great display!!Great size screen and works great for Alexa commands and communication. I have owned all the Alexa devices and o truly love this one. Great display. I want another one.
Terrible Light Bleed From Behind Screen/Panel.Very disappointed as this has one super annoying issue to me. My echo show has tons of light bleed from behind the screens panel. It’s unbearable to me to the point where it ruins the whole experience. Not sure what I should do.
"Amazing.Technology has come a long way, I hope to see some of what the future offers. Show is amazing with super features that blow my mind. Everyone should have one of these!"
Disappointing.We are trying to use the video chart feature &amp; it just will not work! Our son cannot see us at all on his end&amp; we are getting lots of squealing noise! Very disappointing!
"My personal assistant.I simply LOVE Alexa!!! I enjoy playing games and listening to music as I cook. Love.that I can tell her to set alarms, reminders, to do list and shopping list. This is one of the best gifts I have received. Why didn't i know about this sooner????"
"Makes everyday life convenient.Absolutely love this product! We use it for everything, from music, making grocery lists and notes, cooking timers and controlling our lights. I love walking into my house and saying “lights on”. It’s so convenient and functional.If I could change one thing, it would be for a slimmer base. The screen size is perfect for any end table, but it does have a large back that doesn’t fit flush to my other table decor. But none the less, a 5 star product."
"TDH.Love it.  We put this unit in our din between my wife and me, it has changed our lives.  We ask questions all day long.  It's like we are now geniuses.... so much fun."
Big and beautiful.Love how big it is really easy to read. Sound quality is good. The big screen is easy to read in the middle of the night. It does take up some space but it’s worth it.
"The BS, Try this feature cant be removed!1 star because of the try this BS that no matter what some say cannot be removed. Its annoying, it's not like I'm a child that needs constant help with things to try."
"Figuring it out. Seems great so far.Works great so far. I am currently only scratching the surface of what than Show can do. Right now it’s still a bit of a novelty piece, but slowly my house is Coming up to speed with Alexa. I have at least one version of Alexa in virtually every room in the house. Some rooms as many as 3."
"Our Alexa family has another great addition.We have become spoiled with our Alexa family. The new Echo Show has been a great addition. From accessing our outside camera’s to pulling up recipes or adding items to our shopping list, Alexa is always there for us."
Pretty cool!Put it in my kitchen and works really great. Kinda like having a tv in the kitchen just smaller and more compact. Sound quality it really good. Video quality is amazing.
Great but a bit Flawded.I like having a visual display in addition to the audio capabilities.Display is high quality.My only issue is that Alexa often misunderstands my requests
"Good idea, not so good implementation.Text is not formatted for screen, Alexa does not understand many simple commands, display is low fidelity.  SOunds quality is adequate, on par with the old echo.  Can make calls, does display recipes, has trouble with stock quotes."
More info should be available.I like my Show for sure but was a little disappointed that it wasn’t the bigger show !! I was thinking I was buying the largest one .. That is probably my fault but it should say mid size or something .. another thing is I want home screen on at all times or at least when I am around ... nothing anywhere tells us it is light affected .. I like my room dimly kit so my home screen turns off in less than a minute .. I just feel descriptions of product should be more clear !!
"Amazing!!!What an amazing device...!!! Outstanding video and sound quality.... well worth it..!!! And if you are a Samuel L. Jackson fan....and him to your ""Alexa""skills....!!!"
Buy one now.This thing is amazing. Buy one now. The only problem with it is that after using it your traditional Echo speaker just doesn't cut it anymore. Now I have to buy another one.
"It’s beyond my expectations.This echo show 8 HD is the bomb. The sound is so big and the bass is deeper than I expected it to be. The quality of the screen while watching a movie is mind blowing. Now I have also have the Google Nest Hub and the sound isn’t as big as the Echo Show 8 and I can’t stream movies thru My paid subscriptions on it. But the Nest Hub Have YouTube On it, which is a plus. But All in All, I love the Echo Show 8 better."
"Video interface.I think I'll need to move the old Alexa Dot into my office (farther away from the Echo).  Sometimes it seems that one of them hears better than the other (Echo better than the Dot), so they sometimes have a sibling dispute over a command.  I see it mostly over Stop Timer (the Echo sets the timer -- and stops it, too -- but the Dot sometimes complains about being unable to work."
"8 "" screen allows for great viewing.I have this sitting right next to my laptop.  Great for viewing my Ring doorbell which is two rooms away.  Very clear picture.  Easy to view Amazon Prime movies etc."
Alexa and Ring.Alexa does take complex requests at all. Works well for single commands. Like turn off a light. I would like to see Alexa be able to turn off a light and turn on a different one with one command instead of 2 separate. Everything else is really good. I like being able to Ask Alexa to show me the front door and see who’s there and be able to speak to them. That is great. Alexa and Ring is great.
Did not receive my free echo dot with my purchase.Would have been nice to receive the free echo dot with my purchase like I was supposed to. Then i would have gave it a 5 star. Other then that I like my echo show.
"Easy to use, many options.The Echo Show 8 is easy to use the prompts at the bottom aid in learning what is available. Alarms, remainders lists news, music weather and more. Can't wait until the rest of family gets one. And lets not forget smart lights and receptacles."
"Now I can see.We bought Alexa when it was announced and waited for almost 6 months.  This one came in no time.  I love the fact that you can see video, recipes, timer, news etc."
Same as Show 5 only bigger.This is an upgrade from my show 5. Obviously the size is bigger and easy to read. Features are the same as the Show 5 only bigger. Sound is much better than the 5.
"Just right.Purchased for my wife to use in the kitchen, she love the recipes and music she gets during the day. Very easy setup and works and looks great on the counter top."
"Nonstop ridiculous scrolling ads/suggestions ruin picture-frame, CANNOT BE DISABLED ON SHOW 8.Likes: perfect screen size, speaker quality, video chats/video doorbell uses, generally has features that are a great addition for a smart-homeDislikes: cannot watch Netflix, touch-screen navigation/menus could laid-out a bit betterHATES: nonstop ridiculous ads/suggestions scrolling across bottom of the screen are a distraction, also ruins the picture-frame feature AND CANNOT BE DISABLED ON SHOW 8...shockingly poor software choice for normally great Amazon smart-home products."
Love it.This little thing is awesome and a great price. We have the 10in too and we love them. Can hear you clear across the room and pretty loud for such a small device.
"Echo Show 8.I received the Echo Show 8 for Christmas and set up was easy, sound quality is excellent, and the picture quality is better than I expected. I would’ve gave the voice recognition 5 stars, but Alexa still has some frustrating moments where she doesn’t understand what you say. Other than that I love all the Echos I own."
Add a rechargeable battery option.I love this new bigger screen and hate that it is still attached to a power chord without a rechargable battery option.  I want to place them in places without an outlet but I cant because of the annoying power cable
"Try alexa sentence.The most ANNOYING thing is the try alexa sentence at the bottom. Numerous people have complained about it, and Amazon disregards consumers requests. It ruins the pictures that rotate through. Tried going through settings but was not successful.Also, cant customize/even increase the size of the clock display. Have only had it for over 6 hours, I can already tell so many flaws/software updates they need to introduce."
Very pleased.Absolutely love it!  A major upgrade from our dot. The sound is fantastic and the screen convenience is amazing. We got one for us and another to give as a gift.
Love Alexa!This Alexa is amazing! Voice recognition seems much better than the Original Alexa. Sound is fantastic!  It was easy to set up and I love the grocery list that syncs with my phone.
Beware...not as easy as shown.This would be perfect if it was as wasted to set up as advertised.  Purchased several for family members to connect us via video chat... to date they are not connecting...
Wife likes so far with Ring doorbell.Bought to use with Ring 2 doorbell camera. I haven’t had a chance to do much with it other than get the camera to work. Still working on integration with my 3 other echoes.
Outstanding product. Great upgrade to the basic Echo.I upgraded to the Echo Show 8 from the Echo 2nd gen and I am very impressed. The screen resolution is much better than I expected as well as great stereo sound.
Great picture.I love this product.  I’m still learning how to use it.  I think the sound quality is better if you connect a Bluetooth speaker to it.  We have a JBL flip 4 that we attached to our Echo show.
"Very easy setup and use.I really enjoy the Echo Show 8.  It was easy to setup, add in tasks, and use.  Alexa can hear quite well from across the room.  My only kinda complaint is that it has a lot of bass.  I'll do some research to see if there is a way to adjust that.  I just haven't taken to before now to do that."
Deceiving.Bought the echo show for my sons girlfriend it was supposed to come with a small Alexa.it never came with it? I thought it was going to come later but it never came? Very disappointed
Great screen size for much less than the 2nd gen.Love this compromise between the 2nd Gen (expensive) and the echo show 5 (small). Screen size was surprisingly larger than expected. Got the ring indoor camera as a bundle and love it
Love it.I highly recommend this product! This is my first Alexa device and am very happy I chose this. I personally think sound is great for a device like it and the screen is great size for kitchen space.
Love My Echo Show 8.Works great! Love it for many reasons such as recipes in the kitchen. Playing my favorite music whenever I feel I want it. Making calls. The list goes on &amp; on.
Love it!I brought the Echo Show 8 with me from my home in Kentucky when I came to Florida.  I just plugged it in and connected it to the Wifi here.  I can see my front door in KY as I sit here by the window.  It is awesome
I'm in love.I'm in love. It allowed me to put my pictures in that rotate throughout the day. It dims at your do not disturb time. You can watch Amazon prime videos on here. You can listen to pandora and Amazon music. It's more than I expected.
A breeze to set up!We are having a lot of fun asking Alexa questions and getting responses along with photos and other data.  It can do more than I will probably request of it but that’s ok.  Saved $70 on it too!
"Wonderful, great intro to smart home.I have been using this in my bedroom for about a week, and it’s already a part of my routine. I use it as a clock and for music. When I wake up, it turns lights on and tells me the weather and news. The screen size is perfect to watch videos if you choose. I am very happy with it."
Do not Sleep on the Echo 8 it is Amazing!The Echo 8 is great! The sound quality is so good. I have it in my master bedroom and I play my Amazon music on the echo 8. The sound quality is excellent from all area in my bedroom including the master bath. I am so glad I purchase this item!!
"Drop in not working.I bought this show 8 for my daughter and a show 5 for her grandmother so they can call each other. When I go to the contact ( her grandmother) in the Alexa App I click allow drop in. It gives an error message ""something went wrong."" I tried to call customer service but you all have codes required that I enter and it will not accept. Please have someone call me to fix this issue. I cannot find a solution."
"Tech assist needs work.An amazing piece of technology with the potential to transform your everyday life. Truelly useful in any task. However more effort needs to go into instructions, and instalation assistance. I bought 4, two were easy, i spent about 6 hours total with customers service and tech reps to install last two."
"Great.I am impressed with this product, the sound is excellent, the light bulb and plugin is a very convenient feature. I recommend this. I wished I could get the TV sound to come through it! Any advice on how to do it?"
Sometimes you want to know the time from a distance...without asking Alexa.My only complaint is that I CANNOT make the clock number bigger!!! Because  Sometimes I just want to look at the clock from a distance. I don’t want anyone knows that I’m keeping time...by asking Alexa out loud.Thanks
Amazing.Works perfectly for what we need and as described.  We have it in our kitchen and I enjoy being able to have Alexa help me with timers and conversion when cooking.
"design.Received as a gift, self supporting base promotes poor video transmission at a 40 deg. angle, need adjustable base for better video viewing for both parties when chatting ."
Super tiny clock.Disappointed so far. The clock is super tiny and no options to adjust. Bad programming and usability.
Great product bad advertisement.Pretty bummed. Bought this with the extra echo Dot! Who new you had to select it. Lost out on the deal! Pretty shady advertisement bot the product is great!
Ok item.She cannot hear me in the same room. She won’t stream tune in station continuously. Keeps stop playing. So other than having to yell and not playing a Tune In
Amazing Display.The screen is great for viewing. Great for looking up recipes. Not sure if it’s this device or Alexa in general but I get more errors lately with Alexa encountering problems. It’s not just this device but the problem started about the same time as installing this one. Don’t see how there can be a correlation but it’s worth mentioning ???
"Great "" Smart Home Starter!"".What a great idea and product, I'm greatly surprised at all this does. From video calls to my grand children to turning on lights and watching security cameras. Wonderful!"
"Got One For Christmas. Bought 3 More!Great device in a small package. Worth the time to do a little research for what Alexa can do. It’s become my virtual assistant. Calendar and to-do list intervention are awesome.And setting up a morning “Routine” is fantastic. I have an Echo in all the rooms in my house. This one sits on my breakfast table and is the perfect size to have my coffee, catch up on weather, news and my calendar. Then music or meditation and prayer."
Great Gadget.We are loving our Alexa Show.  Finding many things to try.  The picture is great and so is the sound.  Love the recipe feature and also the lyrics to the songs.
So far so good!I've only had it for a couple of months or so. So far so good. I currently have no dislikes. Hopefully that won't change. Simple to set up and personalize.
Excellent screen size for office desk.These items are so useful for a multitude of options. I've 5 of them of various sizes now throughout the house and use them for quick access to various info.
"I love it.I just love it, so many people complain about the Alexa suggestions running along the bottom. It’s not a big deal at all. It doesn’t show it when you watch videos etc. You can also watch YouTube. Love it."
Good product.Good product
Great idea and implementation.I've been an alexa user for years now. This show with the bigger screen is fast and responsive. Comfortable to watch in. Best buy for this holiday season.
"Love My Show.Love my new show, it’s a great partner to my dots.  Haven’t had the time to try all of the functions but I’m sure they will work as well as the ones I have tried."
Multi purpose!Use all the time. For audiobooks.  Watching security cameras. Streaming prime. Weather.  Just great! Also use as a timer for cooking and as my alarm click
Nice big screen. Excellent.One of many Alexas I own. The screen size is big and clear. Good speakers for music. I'm ordering a second one to replace my Echo 5 in my wood stove room.
Love the Echo Show 8!The Echo Show 8 is a great way to catch up with my sister that I'm not able to see as often as I'd like.  I bought one for each of us this past Black Friday and now just love the chance to see her when I talk to her!  I was intrigued by the 'burned duck' commercial and the young woman's ability to connect with her father via video so when I saw the items on sale I figured it was the right time to buy the two of them.
"Love our Echo Show 8.Love having nearly instant viewing of our front door Ring camera.  Love being able to read and hear the Riddle of the Day, Weather on the home screen, etc.  Love it"
"My life is easier now.I love the echo showMy grandson and I talk and see each other now ❤️ the sound is great, I have 4 echos they have spoiled me I really feel like I have a assistant."
Good product.I love it perfect size. Just wish Google and amazon would get along. I subscribe to google play music and YouTube prime which this thing refuses to support.
nice product.It's got clear picture but the sound quality is not great. It sounds muffled like to much base. I have Google home and the speaker quality is so much clearer.
Great addition to the Alexa Devices!I love it! I have the echo dots and this is my first echo show product and I plan to buy more. Great item to have. I like that I can play music throughout home on all devices simultaneously. I like the prime video feature. I wish it supported Netflix and AppleTV. I especially like being able to view my front door camera.
"See who is at the door.Great product, interfaces with Ring Pro doorbell so we can see who is at the door. Great sound quality, good investment for out safety and entertainment."
"makes me feel secure.Bought this specifically to work with my ring doorbell and camera.  Being able to say Alexa show me the backyard/front door, gives me so much peace of mind when I'm home alone."
"Can watch movies on it.Sharp screen, excellent sound quality. Sometimes when it is talking or playing music, it doesn't seem to hear us. But when quiet, it hears across a large room easily. I guess that is to be expected."
Good quality unit.Good sound and picture.  Unfortunately my unit needed upgrade so I sent it back. I did not have manual with upgrade instructions.  Generally no user manual.
A more useful device I could not imagine!We just love this thing and never thought we would use it as much as we do!  The integration with the smart plugs and the ability to video chat with the family is great.  I also like that there is a physical shutter that disables the camera.  The price during the Christmas shopping season made buying these as gifts for family members a no-brainer!
Why did I wait so long?Love Love Love it. Sound quality is excellent. So great to see what you are listening to. Gives recipes and facts. Fun for the kids to see and talk to.
Great screen size and audio.The audio quality on this is great. The devices hears me throughout the room easily and the screen size is perfect. I much prefer this over the show 5.
"Love the echo. Love the Show even more.Sound is great. Screen is very clear. Very easy set up. Love that I can watch a movie, see recipes, search the web, set timers and reminders, play my music, and so much more. Well done Amazon."
Loved this.Product was simple to setup with all my existing products to include the Ring. Even my 3 year old is able to use it with ease. Sound is pretty loud for the size. Recommend buying the screen protector when purchasing.
Its a fun gadget.I recieved this as a Christmas gift. I like it but im still trying to figure out how to use some features. I look forward to using it to call family on it to see how that works
"Not Really Worth the Money!The ""Show 8"" was a disappointment. It's a novelty item at best. Lots of other tech I wish I had spent my money on but, I have it, it's in the living room and I still struggle to find a use for it, other than to give me the weather... The loss of privacy is really not worth it really!I would not buy again and most likely wouldn't give it as a gift, unless I had the box for this one. Sorry, I did have high hopes for this!"
"Awesome screen and sound.I love this product three inches more than I loved my 5 inch show. Sound is awesome, picture is great and it is easy to use. It is one of so many Alexa devices in my home."
Trade-in not worth it. This Product is good.But disappointed about the trade-in. There was additional charge claiming the product appraised was not worth the price promised. This product by itself is good.
"Great gift.My husband loved this as one if his Christmas gifts. He hooked it up with ease and he likes the ability of checking the weather before work, the drop in feature so he can connect with family, I love the recipes and music!"
Great gift.Purchased this up for my 96 yo Aunt.  Set it up for her to call family.  She can handle this pretty well.  sound is loud enough she can talk to family.
"Worth more than my money!Good screen, good sound quality, and alexa is so intuitive to use! My homepod still has better sound quality but for a quarter of the Homepod’s price, i get more the functionality."
Amazing device!This is the first Amazon Echo device we've purchased for this home and I am amazed at its function and feature set at this price. It's just neat all around and super handy!
"I can get help immediately.This is a very nice echo, I love it, but you see I have 2 echo 5 and 4 of the small round , and also 2 of the taller ones soI must be crazy about them. I even have one in the bathroom, you see I am 83 years old and fell in March and broke my hip.  It is surely great forOlder people that lives alone.  Thank you"
Love Technology.I was unable to attend my granddaughters baby shower being held 600 miles from me.I was included in the festivities via my Echo 8.  Next best thing to being there.  I look forward to meeting mynew great granddaughter on my Echo 8.
Fantastic Sound.I own the show 5 and now 8 and they both look and sound great.  If they had a USB port to charge my phone it would the perfect night stand clock/device.
"Alexa does a lot!My main purpose for the purchase was to video call with family. It’s nice to be able to see them while talking to them. My only issue, sometimes hard to hear/understand the sound/voice breaks up. But overall nice purchase for the price, speaker sounds good for music, again, for the price. Love all the things Alexa can do but mostly that I can feel like I’m sitting in my moms living room talking to her. She lives 1200 miles away."
Large clear display in compact form with a integrated camera lens cover.Perfect display to sit on my desk. Small enough to not be in the way and large enough to clearly see video from my Ring doorbell or security cameras. The integration of a physical slide to cover the camera is a nice carry over from the 5in versions. The privacy of a physical camera cover makes this a viable option for a bedroom or anywhere privacy is desired.
"Great kitchen companion...Upgraded from a Show 5 to the Show 8. Perfect size for the kitchen companion. Show 5 is better suited for a nightstand/alarm clock. Better sound, better and bigger picture. So far so good with the upgrade. If only it would as more video services for watching streaming content. As far as I know only Prime Video and Tubi are currently supported."
Great device.I love the Echo Show.  I have two Echo's already and this is a great additions.  I can play music in all rooms at the same time and it is so much fun to make a video call.
"Echo show lover!This is my first wcho show and oh boy do I love it!!! I'm basically stationed in my kitchen sink most part of the day and I just love being able to listen to music, watch videos on vevo and even videochatting while in the kitchen. Best Christmas present ever!"
Needs Two way audio.Works great. Would like for it to work with my blink camera so I can talk back to the person at the door.  Amazon needs to work on that problem asap.
"I love it!It does all the usual Echo Dot things: keeping lists “Alexa, add milk to my shopping list”. “Alexa add pay bills to my to do list”. “Alexa start a menu plan list”.  “Alexa text John Jones”.  All that and shows me my Ring camera, shows recipes so I can look at them while I’m cooking.  My granddaughter plays games with it.  “Alexa play Are You Smarter than a Fifth grader?”  We love it!  Great productivity tool."
“Try Alexa” adverts ruin a great product.Great product but I’m sending it back. Until you actually have to put up with the “try Alexa skills “ scrolling you can’t appreciate how distracting and unwelcome it is. Too bad as this is otherwise a great product. Amazon are you listening?
"Perfect!! Thank you!!For $80, this thing is insane!! I use it for my alarm clock that is amazing and has a TON of customization! I love how I can view my RING cameras and my WYZE camera from it as well. The sound quality is also awesome for such a small unit. Thank you!"
Great upgrade.An exceptional upgrade over other smart home hubs. Great display and integration with other smart products through Alexa skills. Very easy to set up.
Great new look.Love added screen space and great new design of Amazon Show.  Fast and easy to set up. Sound is better that older version also. Excelllent upgrade.
Nice addition to my echo house system.Very easy to set up. Linked up with other echo fast and easy.  Not as full sounding as the full sized u it's. Clear screen and super easy to use. Great price at $79.99.
"Great Product.Exactly what I wanted, and integrated almost instantly with my Ring doorbell.  I love the recipes and news stories which flashes across the screen."
"Echo 8.It is way better than my Echo 5, which I still use but its in the kitchen.  I can play music and send thru to both units, the screen is bigger and more features that I can use!!!  Great product!!!"
Great addition to the Alexa products.The Echo Show is everything it claims to be. The sound &amp; picture quality is excellent! The photo show is wonderful. I highly recommend this device.
"Love It!!!This is a great upgrade from the Show 5. The sound is really great with really good bass as a standalone unit (although I connected it to our home stereo). Within minutes I had it set up with Amazon, SiriusXM, Spotify, and Pandora through the easy to use Alexa Android app. The display is vibrant and clear, and the basic wallpapers are really nice (I just chose the Art category, and all have been great so far). Great product!!"
Love it.I liked the first one but I like this one much better. Better sound and better picture quality. A little larger screen. Nice screen saver choices.
Just Wonderful!I got this as a gift from my daughter and I absolutely love it!Best part is video calling and see that person like the are sitting in front of you!
"Amazing / Amazing / Amazing.Didn't know what I wanted for my Birthday so I told my wife about this.  Wow, this is some product.  Easy to install and works fantastic.  Its a must for Birthday / Christmas or Chanakah"
bad.wko  the plug it in not porable
Hoping to use this at a second home on one account.I have not hooked this up yet. Received at Christmas. I have one at a different house and hope I can use alexa account for 2 different locations.
"LIke the Show 5, only bigger.Very handy for recipes in the kitchen.  Integrates well into the Alexa system.  Sound is okay, but I'm not an audiophile.  Don't buy at full price, as many sales are going on."
Great product.Th show does all kinds of cool things but I like being able to wake up in the middle of the night and see my cameras.Love this tool.
Like....but.Setup is fairy easy but better or more detailed instructions would be nice.  We bought one for our parents &amp; since they aren’t as tech savvy they really had a hard time.  We had a frustrating time figuring out how to get our contacts loaded &amp; how to actually make a video call. The online setup only takes you so far. It would be nice if you could turn the ringer up or change the sound. Unless I’m standing right next to it I can’t hear it ring.
Great buy!I love how it pairs with my ring cameras and door bell. My favorite part is that it will announce there is motion at my door. Looks good in my kitchen.
Perfect size Show 8.Great item show 8 was a awesome fit sound quality is great. We really like the fact you can slide a physical switch to cover the camera for privacy.
Amazon sold a used product as new.It is USED. The seal on the box was cut open. I took out the SHOW 8 and the housing was severely scratched. It's metal so it's more like gouges.
Great sound and integration.I enjoy my echo show 8. Sounds great. Integrates with my smart devices. Only don't like the constant line on the bottom show what Alexa can do.
LOVE IT!!!!!Nice big screen brite colors and very sharp images you will love this size and the sound is awesome. You won`t go wrong with one of these shows
Echo Show 8.Great purchase.  We just added the echo 8 to our collection and could not be happier. Fantastic alarm clock. Love to listen to music in the am so works great for me.  Not too overwhelming but all the wonderful benefits of echo family.
Alexa Echo Show 8.So far we are loving our Echo 8. Its fun to be able to see the grandkids while talking with them. The music sound is great as are the recipes!
"The best of the best.Is like our echo but with screen, also you can control your smart devices + view your security cameras, is a skype, you can talk echo to echo, even do phone calls, is a must have in the house, and specially for elders, and the price is just right. ohhh almost forgot, you can watch movies, videos and learn kitchen recipes."
"Awesome product.This is our 4th Alexa product, absolutely love the sound quality in it, voice recognition is great and screen quality is amazing. Very pleased"
Great !If your thinking about buying this item all I can say is buy it! My entire family wants this new model now! I want one for my classroom as well.
A must have for 2020.This is a must have for every home.  I love watching  amazon prime while did my heavy duty holiday cooking.  This is a must have for this new decade.
Prefer Google.I love the sound quality of this speaker. Not a big fan of ease of use &amp; playing videos like YouTube &amp; asking questions compared to google home hub. This doesn’t work very well with Google Nest either
Wonderful product.Great picture. Easy setup. Easy to use. Also purchased them for our sons families so we can do video calling with them and our grandchildren.
It's a winner so far except for one little flaw no date on the home screen.I really do enjoy this device and am impressed at the abilities of Alexa the sound is pretty decent the only one little flaw I found on the home screen is you have to clock and you have the weather but in the upper right corner it should have the date like Sun 1/5/20 kind of a deal-breaker in a way that's the first thing I noticed when I after I set it up there was no date just a time in the weather
"Alexa with a face... older relatives love it!Upgraded my aunt and uncle to an ‘Alexa with a face’ - they are very happy, the screen helps my older relatives use it more easily. Great price!"
"Useful in many ways.This is an awesome addition to our home. We love to go to sleep to thunderstorm sounds. We ask it goofy questions and love hearing Alexa response.We enjoyed ours so much we got echo dot for family. They use theirs for grocery list, music, and to find out near facts.Also use it to help my grandparents call for another when they need help.Truly a great thing to have around the house."
Fabulous!!I really like being able to look over and see the weather when ever I want. I am still learning to use it. I am sure once I figure it all out it will be fabulous.
Love this product.Love it and it works with my Nest doorbell and thermostat.  Love the stuff that pops up on the screen.  Gives me more ideas of things I can ask it.  Love that weather is on screen too.
Nice device.Really love this device.  It’s perfect as a bed side alarm clock.  Voice recognition is much better than the 1st gen Show and the Echo Dot.
Useful but needs a few things.Better apps with youtube apps tv and regularWay to automatically turn off screen after defined period on inactivitysmaller plug
Does what it says.The sound on this thing is pretty good one complaint I got is that they should of put a usb output to charge your phone or devices since it’s taking up an outlet already
Size and clarity of music and screen.I most appreciate the fact that so far it has played constantly without suddenly stopping! My Echo would always stop playing and it was so annoying!! It’s also cool to see the lyrics. I had no problem Bluetooth it to my Bose speaker. So far I am very happy I bought it and would recommend it.
"Didn't get what ordered.When I ordered this product the ad said I would receive an ECO Dot ""free"".  That did not happen.If you are going to scam folks, thinking you have enough to offer this then run out,...then STOP placing the ads.VERY disappointed as I was hoping the Dot could serve as  a communication device between me and my husband, who has cancer.  When I am working at home and he is laying down I want to know if he needs anything.  VERY, VERY Disappointed!!!"
"I would buy another one.I can’t express how much I like this one, I wish I would have brought this one first. The sounds is great, I like that I can load my pictures on there, and I like that I can look up recipes.  I really like it."
"I love  it.I have convinced my 3 of my Neighbors to get one, a lady in the store and I brought one for my Mother in-law I love this thing."
Good but needs voice recognition improvement.Nice big screen and big sound. It does have trouble hearing sometimes. The dots I have throughout the house have better voice recognition.
"Performance.I love the Alexa show because I can call others as well as see them larger, I can ask whose at my door because it’s connected to my ring system."
"Cool device, at a good price.I received this as a gift, to replace an echo dot. It is a very nice upgrade, especially for playing music. The video aspect is interesting, but I haven't tried it much, yet. All in all, a good upgrade."
"Great product, fun and convenient.5 minutes after I unboxed my Echo show8 I had everything paired together and started playing. I drove my wife crazy with Alexa turn off the fan, turn on the lights. Check front door, play music, Alexa , Alexa, Alexa.I have to change the name now because my wife is sick of Alexa. Over all  this is a great product for both fun and convenience and I highly recommend it to anyone. If I had to complain about anything, well I can't."
Get the 8 and get your “Smart On!”.Voice recognition is still a challenge. Overall I recommend this as the 5 is small n works best as alarm clock substitute as opposed to a tv alternative as well as smart home controller. I have 2 8s 2 5s 2 show second gen and 3 dot gen 3s. They all are unique and worth the $. But the 8 would be the choice if you are only getting one on a budget.
Nice echo show 8.Nice to see videos and listen to music. Talks well and other functions it does well. Slow on the touchscreen and manual mode but he gets it done.
"Great unit for the price!Wi-fi and Bluetooth connections are easy to set up.  Screen size is great for armchair viewing of videos.  With separate low, mid, and high audio frequency gain controls even standalone sound isn’t too bad.  The introductory price of $100 was great too!  Unlike the 10 inch Echo Show it doesn’t produce multichannel surround sound; otherwise, I would probably give it five stars!"
"Love it.So far I love my Alexa smart display I was sick when it arrived, but since I am better I actually having fun with it. I love all the different thing it can do."
"You don't have one yet, WHY??!Sound quality, WOW! Love this Echo Show. Price was great, deal was even better during the holiday season which made it a no brainier. My first Echo and I loved it so much I got my family 2 echo shows for other family members, and added a Dot and Flex to my own home. The picture quality is amazing on the 8"" screen, sound quality is absolutely surprising and fills an entire Master bedroom without breaking a sweat."
Love Echo Show 8.I love the echo show 8.  The only problem needs more work is the pairing this with the Arlo Cameras. It’s really hard to get that to work.
Convenient.Seeing the screen reminds me that I have Alexa right there to answer questions -- I would forget to use her when I just had the dot. I would prefer that there were speakers in the front though. The sound is the best from the back and with the screen in the front it seems silly. Speakers should be in front and back with majority of sound coming from the front.
"Love it!!Love it!! Love that I can see our kids, the weather, our pictures, song lyrics, shopping list, news articles, etc. Display and sound are great!"
"If you're gonna have a wiretap in your house, this is the one.I can only imagine what the people who review my voice commands think of me. In case you're wondering, I'm mostly yelling and cursing at the cats. Anyway it's our 4th Echo device and personally, it's better than the 1st gen dots by far. Alexa needs to work on her jokes though."
"Took forever to get here.Ordered in November, not received until December 27.  Read reviews to figure out how to use her to my liking, i.e. how to avoid ads, etc.  only shows time, temperature, and rotation of my photos, until I ask for something.  Well pleased with her."
"Great sound, clean look.This thing looks and sounds awesome. Easy setup, ordering linked to your amazon account helps speed that up. This thing is pretty cool."
Great gift.Fun. I bought one for my daughter in law for Christmas and she surprised me by getting me one! We both love it! Lots of great features.
Parents Love it!I set this device up in my mother’s home to drop in and have her video call.  It was a hit.  Both parents love it. They ask questions and she answers.  The screen is a nice size for them to see the writing.
Picture quality is great.I now have 3 of the Alexa show's.  They are great when you wan to see who is at the front door or any camera synced with the Alexa app.
"Selections Under Music.Under the selections segment it states, as a choice ""100 Greatest Motown Songs"" but only 4 play over and over and over.  What happened to the other 96?  WORST INVESTMENT ANYONE COULD MAKE!"
"Very nice to view security camera feeds.It is nice to be able to view my security cameras it has pretty good sound quality, if you were right by it I could see this being a good way to watch videos"
"Love it.I have an Echo Spot and a Dot, but traded the Dot in for this wonderful Show. I love it and it's nice to use it with my Ring doorbell."
"Sound quality is amazing.We had the echo spot before, and upgraded to this Show 8.  When we play music, the quality is really wonderful.  Impressive for this device, I'd say.  Had a problem with it playing music at first, customer service reached out immediately and helped solve the issue. Happy, overall, with this product."
Exactly as expected.Great alternative to installing a flatscreen TV in a bedroom. I only need to use my prime video for movies &amp; TV shows when I'm under the weather and the Echo Show is perfect.
Alexa has been having bad days...Alexa is struggling. She doesn't always answer and she gets it wrong more than right. I have other echos and don't have this problem.
It's alexa.Perfect size. Would definitely make an easier option to not have all the notifications pull up. Turned them off in options but some still come up. And disappointed there are not tons of options for clock faces/options
“TRY THIS”.  Make it go away!Will someone at Amazon please listen to the people that are buying your products and paying your salaries......”GET RID OF THAT ANNOYING  ’TRY THIS’  CRAP”. We know how to use Alexa........!!!!!
Great upgrade from original echo model.Works great with my ring doorbell and Wyze cams. Perfect for my nightstand. Replaced my original Echo. Better sound plus a HD screen for a very good price.
"Love it so far, more apps within Alexa echo show please!Set up was easy!  I'm hoping to see more apps integrated for Alexa access like Netflix, Pluto TV &amp; Disney+.  Haven't made first video call yet.  I did learn Alexa will not sync with your phone's contacts. You have to manually add contacts you want to communicate with in the Alexa app."
"Software not up to date.Had for less than one week all internal speakers stopped working, and nothing could bring them back.Returned item to Amazon for refund!!!"
Great Vibes.My wife says that it is the BEST Sounding Echo device she ever heard.
works well with varied lifestyle.I'm just getting accustomed to the echo eight response is terrific the sound is amazing for such a small device but ill know more as I become more familiar with it I'm sur
"My favorite size.I have 10"" shows and 5"" and not 8"" shows, and this is my favorite size.  Not to large to sit on my nightstand but big enough to easily see in the middle of the night if need be, like the Ring alerting."
Very nice.This was a gift for my husband for Christmas. It’s really nice. He loves it. I highly recommend it for those who love electronics.
"The screen size is a game changer!Love this product! The screen size is great (8 inches) and picture quality is perfect. Very easy to integrate with Ring, outlet devices, etc."
"My FAVORITE Alexa Product!Wow! Alexa you have our done yourself. This is the ‘perfect everything’ for recipes, monitoring, movies, and more. The sound is amazing on this product and the picture quality is beautiful!"
"Amazing! Worth the money to upgrade.What an upgrade from the Show 5. Sounds amazing, the screen is nice and big and the voice recognition is so much better then the Show 5"
Awesome echo product.I like this better than my first gen echo show.  In fact that’s what I traded in.  Sound quality is great and picture quality is great.
"One thing missing.I would love this so much more if I could add the day and date on the background where the time and temperature is. I can with My Show 5 but not with the 8. Don't know why the Amazon folks overlooked this detail. If you're listening, Amazon (which we know you are), is there a way to update the software to fix this glitch? Otherwise, I'm a happy camper."
Ring doorbell doesn’t work.I mainly bought this to integrate Ring-door bell so I can see Vedic when someone hits the bell before I open the door. It tries to connect to ring and just goes to home screen without displaying any video. I like Alexa dot a lot which does everything for $29.
The best yet.This unit has excellent sound and video display.  Seems to have a few functions that are new.  Voice recognition still imperfect.
"Perfect size and style.The perfect show. Sound is really good...screen size is perfect for me, not too big or too small...works well in a smart home setting. I wouldn’t trade it for a different size or features."
"Annoying lack of app support.Documentation shipped with product and in app is extremely limited. Very hard for a newcomer like me to understand. I still can’t get the darned chyrons at the bottom of the screen to turn off, so now it’s a digital picture frame brick endlessly and annoyingly hawking Alexa features I have no interest in. Has all the hallmarks of either a product released prematurely or designed by people who have no regard for expanding the Alexa user base."
Doesn't do good voice recognition.-Unable to set language to English/India-Doesnt respond well- doesn't recognize speech correctly- I love my show 5 better. This is just not doing anything correctly
"Great.I bought this for the kitchen.  I have an Echo dot and wanted one with a screen  I love it!  I put my pictures on Amazon Prime and now they scroll as a screen saver - can see my grandchildren while I cook.  I really like the screen for time, temperature, recipes, etc.  I like everything about this new toy!"
Modern and Convenient Desk Addition.Love this in my office to check the door camera and watch the news while I’m working.  Really convenient size and style for a modern office desk space.
Happy buyer.I was looking for a echo with a screen. This product has a lot more functions then I know it even had. So happy with my purchase.
I like the convenience and placement in my kitchen.I purchased three of these for Christmas.  One for myself and two for gifts.  I plugged mine up and followed the directions.  Everything worked as it said.  Some parts I listened to more than once just to be sure I understood correctly.  I love it!  I find myself making lists and asking Alexa for jokes I never used on my other device.
Really good sound.Sounds very good for being so small.  Setup has gotten exceptionally EASY.  Options are well designed and add to the experience.
"We bought 3 more echo 8 for our kids homes.My wife loves her echo 8 ,she mainly plays music but she likes it to find recipes and to talk to family and be able to see each other ,"
Even more useful than an Echo.The capabilities of the Echo Show are substantial. Have it sitting on my office desk and it looks and sounds great. We could see it placed in a variety of rooms including a bedroom since it streams Prime Video (as well as other services). Love it.
"Great sound, and screen resolution, but slow video.Fantastic voice recognition despite it's playing loud music, however the video stutter a lot. May need a little faster processor. Screen resolution is good and solid sounds quality.It's great as an regular echo, but mediocre as an Echo Show.  Got it as a trade in with the original Echo."
Echo Show 8 surpassed all expectations.I love it. I placed it in the kitchen and use it to listen to all my favorite music while cooking and cleaning. I love the recipe feature as well. The sound quality is awesome and when volume is loud it comes close to the quality of a Bose. Very pleased with purchase.
Show 8.Sound is great nice screen much better then the show 5. Same size screen as the 1 st. Generation show but smaller case very nice.
Alexa is getting better over time.Echo Sow understands well but struggles with my mother’s voice with her asthma.  As Alexa does more things I like it even more.
"Nothing working like it should.I have own 2 other Alexa , but this one is the worse i Ask her to play music she responded ok play, but nothing play.  Try many times, still nothing happen. I m returning this."
I can see clearly now.Yes does meet my expectations and more I will recommend it to all looking for to maybe moving up a bit to the 10.1 inches one down the road
"Great product, great sound and easy to use.Really love this product.  Connectivity is great.  Sound quality is good.  Its a great personal assistant.  Very easy to connect and use.  Screen is perfect and its great for video calls.  Will recommend to my friends."
Setting it up.I'm pleased with what I saw when my daughter set it up for me.  But now her two day stay is over and my memory (90 years old) isn't what it used to be.  I wish there was an on line video to enlighten me.
Great speaker and clear screen.Bought this for the kitchen and for recipes. It works really well. Screen is nice and bright and speaker is surprisingly good.
"Over all a good upgrade from a regular echo but needs the stand.I upgraded my echo to echo show 8 and I like the screen aspect of the Alexa but I don’t understand why stand is not included, there design makes stand a necessary thing but it’s sold as a accessory which is not fair !!"
"5 year old echo is lot better.Far field recognition is horrible, hardly hears you. What's the point in having such a device? My 5 year old echo was so much better, i should not have upgraded. :("
Awesome.Love it should have got one along time ago and if you buy the extra attachments you can turn your lights on all over your home.Love it.
"Nice device...So far I really like this device. It was easy to setup and it's easy to use. Very convenient and has all the features I need,"
"Great sound with song lyrics. Best kitchen appliance!I really like playing music and having the lyrics displayed. Not all songs have lyrics but modt on Amazon music do. Just be sure to turn off the ""Do Not Disturb"" setting or the lyrics will stop and screensaver will appear while the song is still playing."
Larger is better!The screen is so much easier to see! The sound is excellent too. I listen to music on it while I am in the kitchen every day.
"Echo 8 - Great Screen Size - Instant Information!!The Echo 8 has been a good addition to our home.  it is so convenient to walk by &amp; see the current time, temperature &amp; news!! I admit I need to experiment more with the settings &amp; enable it to be more integrative with other devices &amp; also to show more information!!"
I absolutely love.Love Love Love! It met all of expectations and works like a charm. It’s so easy and the screen Display is perfect. Worth every penny
"Sound Amazing, Great partner to the Echo show 5.Beautiful picture, screen size perfect, sound is amazing, very pleased with purchase, great product to add to the long line of echo devices in my home."
Louder and Clearer HD than Echo 5.Found that this was obviously much louder than the echo 5 and the screen is better. So if you are a light to decent sleeper you may not need this. Only issue I have is that they took out the alarm clock visually on the home screen that is on the echo 5. So a smaller space or room go with the 5. Larger space the 8 is a must-have.
"Wonderful !Very slick, great like all Amazon a products.  Setup was a snap and it fits nicely in the living room. I recommend this product."
Info on screen is great.Love the Show 8. Sound quality is excellent and watch the song words on screen make it fun to sing along. Easy to set up and easy to use. Weather reports and controlling devices are easy to do.
"Watching over mom.Put near my mother, who is 84 allowing us keep communicating with her from work, home, and she loves alexa music, on prime"
"The ""Try this comments"" on bottom of screen.Why not let the user remove the ""Try this............."" on the bottom of the screen.  It is annoying and I do not find it useful."
"I totally recommend the fire 10 tablet.I love this tablet. It's very is study and very nice looking. It's lite weight and thin, has beautiful color and very clear sound."
Good value.Decent value. Would be nice to have default volume. Maybe it can do that. Always adjusting volume. Stands are too expensive.
Great except for one flaw.My family has enjoyed upgrading to this Echo Show but the home content has frozen on the screen many times instead of continually changing to the next screen.
Echo Show.Love it !  Some many things you can do with it.  Has a Beautiful Sound.  Best Christmas Present I received from my husband
Perfect size Amazon Echo.Love this new addition to the amazon echo show line. Works great for my bedroom. Excellent size. Not too big. Not too small
Awesome and Handy!!I can't explain how wonderful this product is! It's so Awesome! Just need some some skills in how to set it up. But this is amaxing!
Still learning.Still haven't figured everything out.. so.. giving an opinion that's not fully informed on making use of the Alexa platform would not be fair to others
"So far, so good.One of my favorite Christmas purchases.  I like the touch screen, sound quality and ease of use.  So far the Alexa suggestions on the bottom of the screen aren't an annoyance but we'll see.  I may turn off later."
Love it.We were hesitant about getting this product but after getting it we are absolutely happy with this purchase. My main concern was integration with other smart devices but it was a breeze. Really like all features and you can’t beat the price. They had a deal on Black Friday so happy we went for it.
Great product.Great product.  It's a big help in the kitchen and when planning for the day.  It can get a little frustrating at times trying to get the question or command right.  It gets easier with time
"ECHO SHOW 8 - High Definition.I absolutely love this product.  I'm able to ask for weather conditions, watch programs, listen music, so simple to operate and it's in the kitchen so I can have Alexa bring up recipes for me to cook by.  This is the best thing this year!"
"Great purchase.First Alexa device we have purchased, and it has not let us down! Awesome sound quality and it gets loud. The touchscreen works great and we are happy to add it to our household."
"Echo Show 8 is GREAT!!!The Echo Show 8 has a great display, love the size.  It has great sound and is really great to play throughout the entire house.  Always great to be able to ask Alexa things vs having to use my phone or laptop and going to Goggle. It has been a very easy piece of technology to introduce to my 85 year old mother.  She actually hates most technology as she finds it challenging.  Using her voice alone is so easy and simple for her."
"One of the Best.In my opinion, this is one of the best personal assistant devices with a screen available, especially if you use Amazon services. Good size and sound for the price."
"Echo 8 is the best.I had the echo dot for the longest and my friend gave me the echo 8 show and Omg what an amazing upgrade!  It sounds like a large stereo and the video is amazing.  If you are thinking about an upgrade don't hesitate you will love the echo 8 show, I know I do."
"Perfect echo device.I use it on our bar between the kitchen and dining room to use for several situations. Cooking, news, sports scores....."
What a machine.A great way to connect with the internet and all of your loved ones who have Alexa no matter where they are. Fantastic.
"Very pleased with this purchase.Like the photo gallery, ease of setup, and the overall intelligence of this unit.  Aldd Ss o sad puns quality is good."
"I’m still learning, but my Dot is just as useful.I’m not as impressed with the Show as I was hoping.  I find my Echo Dot just as useful.  I also have an Alexa Auto and between all three you can only have music playing on one.  Maybe I set them up wrong.  I’m confused about the groups."
very helpful.We bought this primarily to monitor our Ring video doorbell &amp; it is very convenient for that as well as being entertaining &amp; knowledgeable. We like it.
Very Flexible.The sound is a significant improvement over Show 5.  Screen is also better for displaying photos.  A bargain at $100.
Google works better.Alexa has trouble understanding a lot.
"Great buy! High recommendation!Love this show! I can video call my grandbabies, look up recipes and watch Hulu all from this one device."
"Great smart display, love the sound quality.It's a great smart display and speaker for my kitchen. The sound quality and display resolution are much better than my Echo Show 5. The build quality is solid as always. Love Amazon's device."
"Good quality.I love that I can watch Prime shows and movies on the Echo Show 8.  The sound quality is really good, so much better than my Echo Dot."
Echo Show 8 Review.I got my amazon echo show 8 for Christmas from my mom it is very good me and my mom was shook that the speaker was that loud it is real real loud echo does things for me I don’t even have to do like shop for me set alarms and tell me about the news and forecast while I get ready for the day and Wales me up with some chill morning music this is definitely a purchase you need to make especially if your a busy person like me.
Very Nice Display.The Echo Show 8 has a very clear display and it integrated into my home's environment with zero problems.  I would buy it again.
Love this device.This thing is one of the coolest devices I’ve ever purchased. It’s insane how many commands that Alexa can recognize. I absolutely love this device and I’m definitely planning on buying more of them!! Definitely recommend for anyone.
"Works Great!This was a Gift from a family member for me, it has been fun using it, it works great, all features are really neat!"
Echo Show- 8.The audio is great!  I play my Pandora station on it and keep it on all day.  Enables my control of Sensi thermostats in NY and PA.  Great videos too. Love this device.
"Echo Show 8.Echo show 8 needs better ears.  It just doesn't hear as good as Echo Dot 2 or Echo Dot 3. I don't think there is any way to adjust this. Other than that I love this little gadget. Keep it close and it works fine. Accross the room, not so much."
Good unit beware of extras.Fine product but unhappy echo would charge additional fees $8-9 month for having additional units to upgrade music.
"To turn off the suggestion line.For those who are concerned about the ""things to try"" suggestions at the bottom of the screen.... Swipe down on the screen, tap do not disturb. Like magic, the ""things to try"" disappear &amp; the clock has a larger display!"
Love it!!!Love love this. Bought one for myself and my mother in law. Great for long distance face time for one. So many great features
"Great size screen.Love all about it, replace my old Alexa echo spot with this one, huge change in screen size and much cheaper too."
"Good price and on time.Love the display, easy to use, easy to integrate into the current system as well as other smart items in the house.  The only negative, and I mean no big deal on this, is that you cannot turn the hints off that continually run on the screen."
Show 8 Exceeds.Purchased to have a video upgrade for echo. Wanted to use with remote video cameras and am finding many more uses for the Show 8. Voice recognition is great!
"Love It.I bought this to ""Drop In"" on my sister 1,500 miles away. The image is great, sound is good (could be better for music however, it isn't meant to be a stereo, now is it?) and it is fairly easy to use. I wish it was battery powered so that I wouldn't be tied down to my plugin."
"Awesome Alexa integration, sound not much.Amazingly easy device setup and phenomenal Alexa integration.Not so good the Sound, lots of work to do in that department."
Works great.  I like it uch better than the echo.It's nice to see what Alexa is talking about.  It is also nice that she can integrate my other wireless items with just the use of my voice and I can get her to present the recipes that I request.
"Kitchen assistant!Purchased this to facilitate finding recipes and following the recipe rather than printing it out. It's perfect! Ask for a recipe and it presents several including photos,Great in the  making it easy to scroll through then decide. Screen is big enough to easily read and follow directions."
"The quality appears to be good.I stepped up from the echo 5 to the echo 8 for better sound quality, and visibility of the data. It is a nice communication tool that allows for flexibility in your daily task."
"Awesome.We just added this to our kitchen, my wife loves it for recipes. A perfect addition to our growing Alexa family."
Great product with many uses!I like the sound quality and integration with video doorbells. Kinda cool to have a mini tv by the bed along with it’s photo frame function
Voice bug.It seems to have a bug. Twice while it was telling me the weather for the next 7 days it stopped after pronouncing half of a word and the voice could not speak again for hours.  During this mute period it would make a beep sound id I told it to adjust the volume up or down.
Works flawlessly.I had amazon send one that was already programmed to my system.  Integrated without a problem.  Works flawlessly
"Good value, quality, and function.Convenient size for kitchen/recipe use. Very useful hands free calling, camera monitoring, command and information response. My better half was able to contact me from her residence after a fall out of reach of a phone."
Great Product.I have a lot of ring cameras around my house and wanted to be able to see them just by asking Alexa.  Works fantastic.  Glad I made the purchase
"Where are the speakers?I am a fan of the Amazon smart speakers.  I have several of the dots &amp; echoes. Along with the spot, show 5 and show 10 (1st) generation.The sound and the picture quality of show 8 is better then my show 10 (1st) generation. However, I've been extremely disappointed with the fact that I have to repeat myself over and over to be understood by Alexa. Half the time, my question is never answered."
"Works like it should.Connected to many of the devices we already have, the ring and our thermostat. Kids love asking alexa to tell them jokes. I do wish there was some built in way to change the angle that it sits. Built to be at counter height but we put it on a shelf."
"Great purchase.This is great! The screen is clear and I love having the screen for such things as the weather, recipes etc. ."
"Great size.As all Echo Shows , very easy to set up and integrate with my other shows. I really like the size of the 8. I have the full size show, then the 5’s came out and I purchased 2 of those. For me they’re ok, but small. Love the 8and now have 2 of them!!"
WOW.We have had the Show 8 for a few weeks now and it is amazing. Set up took a while when pairing with all our Alexa enabled devices but once set up it works perfect! We use it for everything and it can probably do sooo much more!!!
"Perfect size for office.Bought echo for my wife's office,sits on her desk and she loves being able to talk to echo and listen to music."
Elegant design with quality audio and great voice recognition.Very enjoyful product.  I start having more and more smart home products from the time i have this echo show 6
"Still trying to study everything it will do.Just got it really up and running with mu Ring doorbell, Kasa T-Link Cams, smart plugs. At times my wife says it is a bit overwhelming. Next we're going to get the communications set up."
"Amazing.Great product. So much better than a dot or echo, because you can see the results you ask for. Picture quality is excellent.  Sound quality is also excellent."
Big clear screen!!Love this show!!! Can see everything easier with the bigger screen. Especially cameras. Definitely worth the upgrade
Not worth it.Really sort of a waste. Takes more time setting up than it should. So you can show some of ur iPhone pictures...big deal!
"Excellent Christmas gift!This was a gift from my son for Christmas so that I could video chat with my granddaughter! It’s very easy to set up, very clear, sound is outstanding and I love it. Never thought I would want anything like this, but it was a great gift!"
Works great and easy to set up.Have to laugh at the killing point for some people is the “try this” at the bottom of the screen. Ridiculous.
"Love this!Love this! Wish I bought it sooner. I have four alexa dots, but this is wonderful to be able to see a screen."
"Better sound quality.I I especially love the slide show, but bought it for outdoor cameras. Also love the recipes you can pull up."
Works well.Better display &amp; sound than version #1.Didn't need Tech Support.T00 expensive for casual gift giving.
Alexa Show 8.This is perfect for my mother to be able to drop in for conversations with my sister and see who's at the door.
"Great Device!Already had a regular echo. Echo show is a great addition to our automated home.  So far, it has been easy to use."
"I love it.I subsequently bought a second one. Now I have two Echo Shows, one Echo, and one dot. I have one Show in the living room/kitchen and one in the master bathroom."
"Loving Alexa!!I am loving it, I still have a lot to learn about routines and other whistles but I will get there. As of know I am enjoying singing along and having the recipes right there in my kitchen. Amazing sound. I already added 2 echo dots and smart bulbs and I can feel that I will continue to add more."
Great product.Love how easy this is to use. I wish the speakers were a little better. Love the functionality with my smart home!
"Bought the Show 8 for a bigger clock face, not available. Like the first Show I have. Crazy.The clock options are gone. I have the Show 5 and liked the large customizable LARGE clock. I bought the 8 because I wanted a LARGER clock face. The triple tap workaround is wonky. I think it does a zoom randomly to show the “Try this” hints and the clock only shows the hours and a colon. Like 10: what good is that? Please update the software, this cannot be that difficult."
"Awesome Echo Show 8.I love this product.  It is very informative and fun.  I like to see the words to the songs and sing along, like karaoke.  Lots of great info, music, facts, etc.  Like a good friend!"
"Great with a Ring doorbell.Very easy to install,  and I am still learning all its features.  It integrated perfectly with my ring doorbell."
Echo Show ok.Echo show is nice addition to my smart home. Bought because it shows Blink cameras. Wish it showed my Night Owl cameras as well.
Randomly plays misc music.The device just randomly starts playing music or saying something when not prompted even in a totally quite room.
Echo show.I use thus to drop in on the pets . It also works well with Ring providing excellent security while away.
"the sound quality out of this thing is out of this world.Great sound! Well made, does all you expect from a Alexa device, but even better.  I highly recommend this device."
THIS IS GREAT.Had Echo 5 and besides the bigger screen on the Echo 8 the sound is improved. Had no problems connecting.
"Amazon Echo show 8.Wow! This echo is amazing and super crisp display, sound is clear and it responds well to your commands."
"Can't add a speaker without shutting main speaker off.I wanted to just add an additional speaker to this for the other side of the bed while using the main speaker but nope. Customer service confirmed you can't do it. Not with blue tooth and not with the Aux jack. FYI, Alexa is no where near as smart as google home. Not even close to being in the same league."
Great Echo Show 8.I recommend the larger screen.  I had no issues linking Alexa friendly accessories.  Does what I expected it to do.
Great size and sound.This is the right size for me. I think the sound is improved. I’m still learning how to really use them.
"Not easy with ring but finally got it to work.It took a while to set up Alexa with the ring doorbell. A few of the reviews helped. One said to make sure the same account that set up Alexa also should set up the ring skill. Also following steps to doable the ring skill, log off Alexa and ring and then turning off the phone and then logging into ring and then finally Alexa and then enabling the skill fixed our issues"
Love Amazon devices.Love these devices I now have my whole house covered can see my ring door lol from my couch.. Love the stereo sound throughout the house
"Nice.I got this for Christmas, and I’m still learning how to use all the options. But it’s been great so far"
Fun.She is so knowledgeable
"Love the screen.I love that I can listen to music, look up recipes, and it’s easier than looking at my phone screen.There is always information running across the screen to be learned and always see what the weather is !"
Nice upgrade.Nice upgrade from the previous model.  It looks much sleeker and the sound is great.  Well done Amazon
so fun and cool to have in my kitchen.amazing for looking up recipes. the only thing I dislike is that Echo Show doesn't respond as quickly.
Great device.I was so surprised at the sound that comes out of this device. Bought it for my parents and they love it.
"Awesome screen and sound!No instructions on how to operate screen. Figured it out on my own. Swipe. Other than that, excellent product, superb sound!"
Terrific.Sound quality is terrific...better than smaller unit if you want to listen to music. Screen is great.
Perfect kitchen Alexa.Just hooked up this week. So far we use the Alexa Echo Show 8 for playing music and singing while cooking breakfast. When I forget the lyrics they are right there on the screen.  It also shows all appointments for the day.  Haven't explored more yet.
"Alexa makes my life easier!Really enjoying my Alexa Echo Show.  I use for so many things: digital picture frame, music player, time and temperature, weather forecasts, etc. I have it paired with my Blink security cameras and just tell Alexa, ""show me the front porch camera"" anytime I want to check it."
"Good product.It's great other then it stopped doing the wallpaper slide show.  Tried to figure out how to fix it to no avail,  still a nice addition to my echo family"
Pretty Please 🙏 Mr. Amazon!!!!!Pretty please Mr. Amazon update the Echo 8 software so I can turn OFF the (Alexa Try suggestions)! You are ruing a good product with the constant on screen suggestions!  Very Annoying
Love it.My biggest complaint is the sound. I had the original Alexa speaker in the living room/kitchen area and it’s sound was enough for both rooms. The shows speaker is loud enough for one room but not both. I love the screen though and it does better recognizing my voice than the original. I’m up to 4 Alexa devices around my house and I love linking them all together for music all around.
"Better then the 5.I really like the screen size, not too big for the night table and big enough to see. It works fast and is like the 5 but better."
"A most useful devices to have.I like you can add other Ring Door Bell Camera, Spot Camera to view with  Echo show and a lot more."
The Echo Show 8 is great as a stand-alone product but also integrates well with Blink.The size fits very well with the location where it is placed - not too big and not too small. Alexa has responded accurately to all my requests and I am entirely satisfied with this product. A good deal of thought went into the packaging of this product to ensure that it arrives safely.
Does everything I could ask for in more of the sound quality is amazing for the bedroom.The perfect addition to my bedroom. I just close the shutter on the camera when I’m home and open it when I leave as a means of checking in on my house. Does everything I could ask for in more of the sound quality is amazing for the bedroom. Considering getting my mother the smaller version so that way we communicate I can see her.
"I'm a big fan.Works well, great screen, doesn't pause music during incoming video call.  Easy to use.  I'm a big fan."
"Good product but lacks some capabilities.I liked the picture quality and I liked the audio.  I liked the cooking recipes and videos. However,  I would like to be able to put my cable provider on the echo show."
"Information , weather,  recipes!!!The Alexa 8 is a good size on the kitchen counter. The sound quality of music is wonderful. I like the shopping list and her info on cooking has been helpful. Love her."
Great product.Great product lots of features I use it all the time for researching; weather; history; movies; etc
Very pleased with the Echo Show 8.Love my Alexa...The sound quality is great.  Voice recognition and the picture quality is awesome.
Worth It.So far its doing all that was stated that it could do. I  really enjoy having it connected to my Ring.
"Great Amazon Product!!Love your Product, but having a serious issue with interacting with ""Ring"" video doorbell ""App""!!!"
Great sound.We like the Show so much better. Easy to use and love seeing the screen for recipes. The size is a bit wider than we expected but we made it work.
"Nice size screen.Sound quality better than expected.Received as a gift, but set up in the kitchen for sharing."
"Alexa vs Alexa show.It's just alright, it doesn't always hear my voice, while at least 3 Alexa's do hear me in various parts of the house."
Worth the money!Loved this! Easy set up!I also have the Google Hub and it is not as a simple process. Still not completely set up!
"Save your money.Meh, it’s ok. My life is no better or worse with it. Sometimes I buy technology just because it’s newer technology, and this is one of those purchases. I probably like the echoes better just because I can make them cordless by putting a battery on them and taking them outside. Would  I do this all over again?  No."
It's not bad but not as good as I was hopeful for.It's great but you can't add any other video apps using music is meh sound quality is great though I guess I expected more
Love IT!Just LOVE IT!  This is my fifth Echo and I’m hooked. Does everything you’d like it to do AND MORE.
Large screen and great gift!Great gift! My father loved the show because he can watch how to videos in his shop. Great sound too!
Great knowledge companion.I bought this as a gift for my spouse.  She says it's on of the best gifts she has ever received.
I love the concept and convenience but she is annoying.As with most Alexa products she clearly does not understand what you are saying. I can't count how many times I am playing a game when you need to answer and you will give the correct answer and Alexa will say no and then repeat the same thing you just said.
Best Purchase Ever.Best purchase ever! I bought this for my wife and she really loves it. Sounds is pretty amazing. 😍❤️😋
"Great for keeping in touch with family.Great product. We use it to video call grandparents and family who live in other states. Great video quality. Wife sometimes has a hard time getting it to respond without telling. Also, trying to video call can be a little tricky until you have it set up right. Once you know the ins and outs it is simple and fun."
Great product.Mostly used for weather and recipes but always left on the photo album as a constantly changing picture is awesome.
"Very handy.So far a great addition to our house. Very handy in the kitchen for music, recipes, general questions and shopping lists."
"Great personal assistant.The echo show is a fun and useful device. There are many videos online explaining why. One of the many ways I use it is to control the lights in my house. It responds/listens  better than google home too, especially when louder music is playing."
"Eliminate ""Alexa Try..."" Always on the screen!!!I really like the show. Still learning all it does. The HUGE drawback and the reason I cannot gouge it 5 stars is that you cannot get rid of the Try Alexa suggestions at the bottom of the screen. AMAZON, FIX THIS!! I don't like that this is always on the screen. I have other Echo divides devices and when I want to try a new skill I just go to the app and enable it. I don't need to see suggestions."
The price and quality.Love it made it so possible to talk to my daughter..will recommend this product to everyone in my family..
How did I live without it this long?Love it! Could do without all the ads but went in preferences and figured out how to hide them. Good sounding too.
Easy Set Up.I love my Echo 8. I am still learning it and find it difficult to get answers to my questions without calling. Wished there was a search option since I have trouble finding what I am looking for. Customer Service is tops-they are really helpful
Nice Size and Quality.Really liked size and sound quality. Excellent Sale Price
Nice size!Much nicer than the 5” and smaller of course than the 10”.  Fits nicely under my dual monitors.
Great addition to my Alexa family.Easy integration and setup.  The sound quality is amazing.  Still finding new features and uses everyday.
Great addition to the Alexa family.Wonderful addition.  Great sound.  Great options .The size (8) is simply perfect.  Great for reading or watching recipes.  Did I mention the sound is awesome?
"Well worth the investment. Best echo device, hands down!!What an amazing device! It looks good, beautiful screen. Sounds great and.hasnt missed a wake up word even from 40 ft away!! I bought a second one for my office!!!"
Upgrade Your Echo.I love my new Echo Show. I've had an Echo since they first came out. The sound is awesome and the video is crisp and clear. However the scrolling ads (as others have mentioned) are super annoying! Otherwise very pleased.
Poor Microphones.This unit does not listen very well. You have to scream most of the time to get alexa to hear you.For alexa to hear you the room has to be very quiet. When I put the unit in a multi speaker group the sound is filled with static. Now the unit is useless in a multi speaker group. Tried rebooting units to correct this problem but still no luck.
Not really much better than the original alexa.I dislike that I can’t really specify what I want but get a facsimile instead. I will use it for phone contact. I use it for music and a timer now
"Great add on to my Alexa devices.I have my pictures from amazon photos rotating as my background and the functions work good.  Sound is full, and all voice gestures work."
"Great.I love the clarity of the screen, just had a hard time to hook to my ring. I highly recommend"
Excited.Still in the process of evaluating new addition to the house. It has only been a week and a half
"Very happy with the purchase.Liked the product so far. Speaker quality is really good and display is decent enough.  Voice commands are understood  but  science query responses can be a little more detailed for the kids. Cannot play youtube directly which is a mimor drawback. But barring the above two issues , it is really good"
"Best Alexa yet.It is responsive, easy to set up, and I really like the large screen.  I may get another one."
"Down Loading the App will make the experience more useful.I like the simple way to set it up.  And I enjoy the pictures, ability to hear the weather as well as music.  It is a fantastic device.  And it helps you with useful knowledge.  ----recipes and more."
"Cool unit, great screen.Just started working with this unit, but has wonderful abilities. Looking forward to watching movies on it."
"We love our Echo Show 8!We upgraded from an Echo device to the Echo Show 8. We love it! We added Amazon photos, so now our photos rotate across the screen! Great feature! We also synced it with our family calendar and now our next event or appointment periodically flashes across the screen. We love our Echo Show 8!!"
"Great screen and excellent sound quality.Bought to upgrade my original echo show sharp.screen , sound quality is great  my only complaint is lack of celebrity voice I had Alec Baldwin as my alarm I wish they would bring it back purchased Black Friday can’t beat the price especially compared to echo show 2"
"Easy to set up and start using right away.I'm still learning all of the great features but I love asking Alexa about the weather, having the lyrics to songs displayed and creating and using To Do Lists."
Easy as 1 2 3.I'm old school when it comes to electronics. This Echo 8 was so easy to set up and use. Baby boomers and their parents don't be afraid of this product.
It’s pretty darn handy.I love this product. I don’t understand why I cannot stream content through all my devices.
Amazing sound.Love it!!! The bass is amazing good sound quality. I just hate that it says “try this” across the screen
Great product.The Echo Show 8 is a great and useful device.  It is fast becoming my go to amazon device.
"User Friendly.I love asking Alexa for information and the riddle of the day is great.  I really like that I was able to have my pictures displayed, it brings back special memories of family, friends, and places I have traveled to."
Nice.Clear picture great sound only thing cannot add Netflix app but other than that good to go
Good gift great price.But this is a gift I have no idea how well it formations but it should do as well as most Amazon products and Alexa products work
Terrific.This Alexa is absolutely terrific there is an unlimited amount of commands she can respond to. the quality of the sound is excellent.
Alexa vs. Google home.Haven't figured out how to use the calculator yet. It has a hard time recognizing your voice. Much better than the Google home. We love it. It's so versitial.
Needs work.Disappointed that on the ring skill they screen does not automatically show who is at the door.
Excellent.Works great. Easily connected my ring doorbell to it.  The wife talks with video to her sister in another city.  Music sounds very good.
"a little bit dissapointed.""Try Alexa ..."" is annoying.  And when someone push the Ring door bell, I want Echo Show monitor to show front door camera automatically.  For now you have to ask Echo Show to show the front door camera."
Great Sound and quality.Great sounding device. Very robust. Has a little weight to it. Video is clear and recognition of my voice is awesome.
Great integration with Ring and other Smart Home decvces.Surpasses Google Nest devices in all categories except random information retrieval  and follow up questions.  Great integration with Amazon Prime Video and Music
Chill Pill with Echo.This product makes life easier. Probably sounds lazy but it’s true. Enhanced safety and security linked with devices and doorbell.
"Gift.My daughter bought me this as a gift. I absolutely love ti!!! I listen to music, call up recipes and all kind of stuff."
"Great Sound.Not your average Alexa device.  Nice big clear screen, big powerful voice.  I like it."
Perfect addition to my kitchen.I was on the fence for a while about buying an Echo Show but so glad I did! It is perfect in my kitchen!
"Useful!Received as a gift; really neat!  Like that questions about the weather, etc., can be answered so quickly."
Very happy.Very pleased with the Echo Show 8.  The screen is a good size and the sound is amazing.
Good product.I was pleasantly surprised by the sound quality. I thought I might have to buy a separate Bluetooth speaker but I won’t need the extra speaker.
Mediocre and not up to typical Amazon standards.This device has limited config options. Not what you'd expect from a smart device in 2020. The  path to making video calls is unintuitive and when you figure it out is clunky at best.
works.I think the 5 inch would of been better choice for bed but great in kitchen / living room so swapped with a spot.  awesome and love the photo option
"Great item.I love using echo show for trying new recipes.  I keep it in the kitchen...listen to music, play games, and get the news."
Doesn’t do everything at all!I don’t like the fact that when I ask Alexa a question she can’t answer 99.5% of the stuff! When I ask for news she repeats the same one news topic over and over. I feel that this is such a huge waste of money. The only reason I have not returned it is because I bought 3 just to video chat family members since I do not like social media in my family dynamic at all!
"Love it.I like the size and the ease of setting up. Fun to use, great at answering questions."
Echo is easy.This is a great addition to the Alexa brand. We really enjoy face timing our grandkids.
"Well designed device.I am impressed by the sound and picture quality.  We use it for music, news and games."
Great.So far i love! i have only had it a few days.love  the display ask for a recipe you see a demo and can save the recipeas well..  Have a lot to learn yet.
Love it so far.As per all alexa devices voice recognition needs to be improved ! Other wise we love it !!
"Simplifies life.  I use it for recipes, photos, alarms &amp; more.The only thing I would suggest if an ebook of tips and tricks that is free with a link in the paperwork.  Love it!"
"The Amazon Echo gives me the most and best return for my money.I like the ability to listen to different radio stations around the country. I can tell echo to turn the lights on or off. I have all of the Echo except the first one and like a nut, I gave it to my best friend. Long story short Amazon Echoes are the best."
"Beautiful display.For a very low price, the display is awesome and the set up was nothing.  Will probably put in more rooms."
Get the Show8.Love the size of the screen!!! The whole thing is just improved!!! Way to go Amazon!
Pretty good sound.The screen does not get dark enough for me at night. It has really good sound. Alexa is still frustrating as she doesn’t know that much. I get a ton of “I don’t know that “.
"Video quality.Echo show works great, have only encountered one problem and this is with a Eufy spotlight camera which will not connect with show. Great unit that works very well. Would recommend."
Very low light screen for those that like dark rooms for sleep.Pleasantly surprised by how low light is emitted with the time.  Perfect for wanting a very dark room when sleeping.  Plus all the other things it does.
"So far 😊.So far so good! Works amazingly, bought it initially with the intention of replacing an ⏰."
"I'm too stupid to set up my blink system.I cant get this thing to work, it keeps telling me Alexa is not installed on this device?  Asked for help on the Blink customer service but my device will not open the path, I'm about ready to send this thing back with some terrible reviews if I can't get customer support to call me"
"Little device. Big sound.This little speaker packs a punch! The sound is awesome and the display and camera are great for the price. Get a stand though, the angle makes it hard to out on any surface higher than a standard side table."
Great gift to keep in touch.My mom got this for me as a gift so we could see each other more.  Works perfectly.
"Top notch device.This is a awesome device. I wish I could give it 6 stars... it is very loud, great bass and great video quality... 2 thumbs up"
Set it up right.This thing is awesome it does it all
Great item!!!I love this thing!!! Definitely an upgrade over the Echo Dot's and full-size units. I love the video chat feature as well.
Success.Another great addition to my smart home. I now have 10 Alexa devices around the house
Great Device.The sound system is very good for playing music and I like the 8 inch screen. It is nice to always see the time and temperature on it. I also like that it displays my photos on the screen.
It was very easy to set up!Great quality product. Even the shipping box was classy. Already planning my next one.
Very poor customer support.I have now spent close to 3 hours trying to get one function of this to work - to make calls.  I have been told various things by various customer support people - none of which resolved the issue.
"how she fines every song that U ask her to play.I Love my Alexa 8  U can get world news, weather,  and any song that U want to hear  Have one in Master Bedroom,  Family room,  and my Office  and one in the Kitchen"
"Makes a great gift.I am very happy with the sound clarity, the vast amount of information available all through the Amazon web site.  I recommend this item, especially if you like playing around with the technology involved. There are add on's available also if you don't mind the small monthly fees."
Picture and sound.I bought this for my kitchen. I wanted the echo show so I could do recipies with videos and it's perfect. The sound and picture are great. We love it.
"Alexa Echo Show 8 is great.Alexa Echo Show 8 is a great product. Still needs a bit improvement in interaction with other products but so far its aheadin beating Google products. Works excellent with Ring, just wish it worked with the MyQ Garage door opener and other video call apps. Right now it only works with Skype."
The new Echo Show.Great update to the echo show series. Nice sound from a small unit. Great display.
Love it.Love that I can communicate with my daughters without having to pick up the phone.
Amazon hit it out of the park with this one.This is an awesome device. As always it starts with the great way Amazon packages the device and ease of setup.Ready to go in less than 3 minutes. Sound quality is the best of any Echo yet. Screen size is just right.
Great product.We use this as our daily alarm clock. Easy to set with a simple voice command and  wake to music
"Too close or ?Sounds squeaky at times, not sure if volume is too loud, or too close to echo......"
Amazing and fun.Love this thing. Works amazingly.  Can't stop playing with it. Something new every day.
great echo.Like the larger size of this echo. Otherwise its seem to be just like the echo 5
Echo Show 8.I really like this product. It’s very difficult sometimes to get the wording right so she can answer my question. Sometimes i have the question answered by looking it up on my phone before Alexa can answer. I’ve had the Echo products in every room of my home. Over all this product is great and I will continue to use and buy.
I wish the ring doorbell would pop up faster.I like everything about it except the ring doorbell part could use some updates to make it faster and show it faster
great to keep up with the grandkids.Like it so I can see my grand kids. A little difficult to set up but once done it is great
Hella better then my gen 2 alexa..I really really like this. The bass is amazing. Screen is super bright and clear
"The Features.Just received for a Xmas gift, still learning/teaching it. Just scratching the tip of the iceberg right now, go far so good."
"Echo Show 8.The Echo Show 8 is everything I hoped it would be.  Picture is beautiful,  sound is great, recognizes what I say, and is very helpful like all echo products are."
"I wanted a tv in the kitchen but this is so much better.I love it! It can read my Audio books, play music, find recipes, etc. The screen size is perfect for my kitchen. I’m still learn  in my what all I can do with it and the dot but so far, so good."
"Works very well, but needs a lot more power...For fun and playing it’s a toy with limited capabilities,  for a smart house it works great and control almost everything."
"Love the echo.Picture, sound are great and impressed me. Many features, links with many products."
Love it.Absolutely love my show. My internet is very slow but it still works great. Love being able to see how something is spelled. I use the a lot.
"Love!I put in the kitchen which is usually the biggest hang out spot in the house. Love being able to control things like the lights, watch movies while cooking, listen to music or even play a trivia game with the kids."
Prefect.I bought my before I came out and honestly I’m soooo happy I did. It’s so good and I love that beautiful picture quality of it and the sound.
Love my Alexa!!Alexa has more techno savvy than I do . . . makes my life simpler! I am really enjoying having her in the house!
Worth it!I bought three for each household in my immediate family. Gave it them on Christmas they lived it. Totally funny hearing all the Alexa's talking at once after I made them open it at the same time. Now we can all keep in touch
Does more than I expected.Plenty of skills to integrate into smart devices. Makes a great heart for your smart home.
Love this size of Echo Show.I really like seeing the lyrics to music and reading recipe off of it while cooking.
Great upgrade from Echo.So much more versatile than the regular echo!  Great display and sound.  Even better than expected!
"Love it.WOW!  Easy to set up, to use &amp; sharing with another user.  Have always wanted &amp; glad I waited until now to get until now"
"Nice Upgrade from an Echo Dot.Received this as a gift, had no problem getting it all set up. Very happy with it."
Best of all the Echo Shows!!Best of all the Echo Shows... best picture- best sound- and Alexa integration!
"This one listens to me, and it has good suggestions plus Visual.This device is much more up to date and can find a lot of stuff, Visually I doubt I will just speak to a round object. -"
I hate filling out these miserable things.It’s pretty simple look at the stars now you understand where I’m coming from
"Smart Home Device and Alexa.I love that I have EVERYTHING on this device. Pictures, Appointment, Notification, I can call other family members THIS DEVICE IS AWESOME and you can set your house up as a Smart Home . What more could you want ?"
"Great to keep the family in touch.Got this for christmas so that our kids could video chat with both sets of grandparents, and to also upgrade us from the dot. Worked fantastically so far, we have used it for weather, music, and video chatting. No problems unless it is a busy room, alexa will then have some trouble picking up your voice."
Great gadget and easy to use.We are really enjoying this gift from my brother. We are able to do video calls with him with clear sound and very good video.The alarm feature has also been beneficial.
"We can hope Amazon will keep improving A.I.Absolutely Love this product. Plugged in, signed in and updated in minutes."
Not perfect but nice to have.Alexa gets confused easily.andI wish the screen would auto shut down after 30 seconds / 1 minute if non use.
Pinterest?!?Love this in my kitchen but it would be SO AWESOME if I could get Pinterest on my Alexa so I can look up all the recipes I use.
Great deal.This is my first echo and I love it. We can watch amazon shows on it while we cook.
"Alexa a helpful tool.look up recipes, learn fun facts from the question of the day or ask any question - its fun to interact."
Love it.I'm in love with this thing. Controls everything in the house... even products without alexa built in like sonos and yi and blink. Sound quality is perfect.
"Bought these for the grandparents to talk to the grand kids.It’s a Christmas gift for everyone, but hoping the grand kids enjoy them!!"
Perfect size.Very clear display. It’s the perfect size. Next best thing might be a TV???
"Love this device.This would have gotten five stars across the board, but the sound tends to have a lot of bass. The extra stand to me is a necessity. It would be nice if one were included instead of costing extra and shipping separately. I would buy another one."
Great.I love it. The Echo 8 works great with my Ring doorbell and the 3 Echo Dots I have in the house.
"Made our Christmas complete.Finally able to talk to my Airman Son, face to face after a year.  He was even able to play Christmas white elephant with our large family.  Spending the that time with him was the best Christmas present we could have ever asked for"
"She's always listening.I love the power of this device, and what all i can do with it. But knowing Alexa/Amazon is always listening even with the Mic ""off"" is always a little unnerving. but I guess thats what you have to deal with for a proper smart home device that actually works without 1000 steps or compatibility issues."
"Excellent product.Use it in our kitchen for daily info, clock, weather, music, and any other needed info!"
I love it:).My husband gifted me this and I love it.It’s portable and I watch Tv in bed so when my hubby is sleeping it won’t disturb him or I just play my smooth jazz which sounds amazing and when I’m doing my makeup and getting ready in my closet I use it in there I wanted to put a small Tv in there but my Echo show bridge that gap perfectly thank you hubby!!!
"I'm Happy with it.I was hoping to be able to Face time with my family like from my phone. Didn't realize that they would have to have an Echo also. And, how do I put my recipes on it to use while baking.. ?"
Favorite new toy.Great echo show.  Love that i can turn on and off the camera and speaker.
Nice device.This is our 2nd Alexa and it is great for recipes and viewing ring doorbells
"Want big clock function like show 5...It's just like the show 5 except for the feature I was looking for, a large clock face. Hopefully this is added sooner than later."
Best home device for security and entertainment.I love the ease of setup and the immediate connectivity to my ring systems.
The sound and the image is great. I love it.This quality of sound is great. I enjoy listening to my music on it. I am working on as to how to set it up to my security cameras in my home and how to best use it with my Ring door bell.
Echo Show 8 very useful.Good quality programming and features. Video calling set up is difficult.
Works Well.Has a lot of gee whiz info but also things that are needed right away.  Good recipes.
EVERYTHING in 1 pretty package!!I love everything about this Echo Show8”. I use mine in my kitchen area which is awesome for things like recipe searches to bluetoothing my tv to better hear the sound in the kitchen. Overall very satisfied!!
"Great little smart device.The Show 8 has been very convenient to have around for listening to music while cooking, using a timer or just a simple check on the weather forecast. The sound quality is surprisingly good and the screen shows very sharp and clear images. I have seen reviews complaining of the suggestions at the bottom of the screen but they don't bother me at all."
Another echo.A bigger version of my little echo...good pic...ok sound ....easy to use
It did not add much to what I have with the speaker alexa.set up was not easy and at the end it did not add much to speaker alexas
Great to use in the kitchen.Easy setup. Would be nice if the power plug didn't extend out from the back.
"Tremendous evolution of Alexa capabilities!Wonderful product, integration of the power of Alex’s AI with beautiful graphics!"
"Great Upgrade.Screen resolution is better than I expected, sound is excellent.I haven't had a chance to fully explore the functionality but I'm impressed so far."
"So useful.This product is everything I expected.  It is useful for daily news briefs, timers, reminders, listening to music, and linking to our smart plugs. Great picture and great sound."
Voice Recognition Terrible.Worst Echo device yet. Every generation gets better sound quality and worse voice recognition.  This generation is virtually unusable because the voice recognition is so lousy.
Love this.Super happy with this purchase  Easy to set up and love that I can video chat with my family on it
Makes family life easier.Definitely love our echo show. Helps with my kids on a visual when it comes to scheduling and reminders. Sounds really good too. Dont need to have the volume very high.
"Great product.Great product, good qualityFast deliveryWill buy again A+++"
Great Addition to My Alexa Devices.Love my Echo 8. The screen is larger and the sound quality is excellent.
"It adds so much more to Elexa.The 8 inch screen is just the right size for me, the sound is good to. it is nice to see things that you don't have to go to the app. all the time. I just wish that you could change the clock face. Otherwise a very good products."
"Great cooking companion.Works really.  I use the Echo Show to video chat with my family when I am out of town.Also, it is awesome as a cooking companion.  I keep it right near the stove and can get any recipe with a quick phrase."
"Size is unique to any room or placement.This Echo Show 8 is a perfect size to place anywhere. I also have an Echo Show 2nd Generation &amp; 2 Echo Show 5s. If the Show 8 had been available, I would have ordered 2 of them instead of the 5s cuz of size. It's easier to see from a distance.  Thumbs up!"
"Wish I waited 12 days to pay $20 less for the product.It’s a really great device. Super simple to use. The 1MP camera is kind of a joke but it is what it is. I’m really pissed it’s now $20 cheaper than when I first pre ordered it. Not 11 days ago it was $100 (Prime price), now it’s $80. If I knew it would be cheaper 12 days later, I would have waited."
"You need one.Looks great, easy to set up and use. Great screen size with a very good picture."
great screen.does not seem to hear as good as the dots and such  but overall i love it
"My wife loves this product.Very nice screen. It has the weather, and time displayed. Shows the times for any alarms you set."
Can read lyrics to songs playing on Echo.I love that I can read the lyrics when Im.playing music through Alexa.
You need one in your kitchen if you don't have one.It is pretty quick and sounds AMAZING. Love the manual camrea shutter on it and love that  it has the web browsers. For the price it is so worth getting. The price and size is perfect for a kitchen and maybe a bedroom. Also the sound is crisp and the subwoofer in it makes it even better. Great buy!
Screen it's great and fits great in the kitchen.So far I'm impressed. It's really good for my needs. I'm still learning and I believe Alexa and I are going to get along well. So far it's been satisfying my needs. I'm impressed with the guard home when you're leave home. Genius.
"Great variety of tools!Great color and sound. It can do so many things from setting an alarm, listening to music or watching movies."
"Alexa Show is a good product for the money.Nice device, Amazon needs better tech support IMHO. The sound is good, as is the video quality. The Alexa app could be better too. Overall, I’m satisfied with my purchase."
Excellent.Loved this. I bought one for my daughter too so now we can video call.
It’s The Big Show.We added this to our kitchen and now have Alexa all over the house. Sounds great playing music
"You won’t be disappointed with this purchase!This is a great device!! So much more versatile than the Apple Home Pod. As I said in a prior review, the Apple Home Pod was great for music sound quality, but that was about it. The Echo Show can really do anything and everything. I am TOTALLY satisfied with this and still have so very much more to learn about its capabilities."
Wyze camera intergration shoddy.When used as advertised with Wyze cameras the best you can get is 15 min view time before it times out and toggles all its other nonsense. NOT practical as a means to view Wyze cameras
"Poor AI compared with previous echo plus.Alexa has a poor voice recognition compared with the alexa plus I previously owned, new echo does not listen as echo plus does and it has a robotic answer voice (not natural) I had the sensation that is more dummie compared with previous version, I think the screen is very nice but with a poor AI"
"Works great!Easy to set up and use. Great smart home hub, no zigbee capability though."
"Easy Set Up, Great Sound.Easy set up, picks up my Blink Cams, and sync'd to my phone for music."
"Good device, needs stand.Wish this came with a stand that allowed you to adjust viewing angle. I know you can buy a separate one, but seems like something that should be integrated."
Echo 8.Microphone is weak on this model. Unit in other rooms will answer before show 8 will
Love this thing!I’m really excited about all this will do.  It’s like having a computer on all the time that is voice activated.  Alexa is always there for me and I’m hooked.
Quality.I love this product. It is worth buying it especially if you're trying to convert your home a smart home?I was able to connect all my smart devices to my echo show 8. And I love all the features it comes with.
Quality.This was a good deal for us and we love the video and audio. Thank You.
Great product.Really enjoy it the communication process the photos... all good qualities I was looking for in this product
Excellent Device.Excellent devie. Clear sound and video. I use it to link Ring devices.
Would give it 5 stars if the clock was big enough to see.  Why!?Clock and temp is small and hard to see. No way to make it bigger ;(
Magic start with ALEXA.I am loving it. Best thing I ever have it....😊😊It’s awesome &amp; so helpful in daily routine lifeTHANK YOU
My Amazon Show.Not exactly it can or can't do.  Still wish it had more info.  But will continue to use.
"Enjoy ease of setup and use.I am enjoying having Alexa in my living room, and I can SEE the weather forecast,  lyrics to songs, my nephew enjoys asking questions and seeing as well as hearing an answer"
Miss the Orginal.I really miss my old Alexa. My old Alexa was perfect.  You could hear people and my music.  This one has a mind of her own and she is worthless.  They told me they could not reset my old one so I bought this one.  Horrible replacement!!!!
Perfect size for kitchens.I use the echo 8 in my kitchen for cooking and with help quilting.  The screen is perfect.
My new best friend!Love it. Use it all the time. Like that I can customize to my tastes.
Great picture and sound quality.Really like the eighth inch display already had two 5-inch. Sound quality is really good.
Love it.Love the cooking video and morning updates. Sound quality is great.
Good Product.I like the Echo 10. We have a doorbell cam and its very handy for that. Er have other Echos but this is our first with a display.
"Didn’t get the Alexa smart plug with it.My echo show 8 was supposed to come with an Alexa smart plug, but there was none in the package. Otherwise I love my echo show 8."
Alexa.Traded my tower for the screen version. Love my Blink camera there!
Best ever Echo. Great Price.So far I Love my Echo Show. Having alot of fun. sound is great..love all it can do.
"Great sound, picture and quality of device.The only thing i wish you could do is be able to stream other apps like netflix as well as prime movies ect.. i have several different ones and was hoping that i could watch them all on one device because we travel a lot. Please make one that i can watch anything."
Save you money!My device have a constant static sound when I call my friend. It also does not recognize the phrases I’m searching for example Alexa show me a recipe for turkey and Alexa says I’m having trouble with that. Very disappointed.
Best of both worlds.It offers you all the features of Alexa along with video calling. It's the best of both worlds. With a recent newborn addition to our family it was important that grandparents have the ability to see her whenever they want. I was also able to move our echo dot into the basement so now we have coverage across the whole house.
"Echo show 8 wonderful!Love the fast response, words showing on the screen for songs and recipes."
"Music sounds awesome.I just love my new echo show 8, great sound and screen is fantastic"
"Sounds great.Echo is fun. Nice size, music sounds great and awesome for recipes"
Esta bueno.Esta muy bueno pero lo que no me gusta y no logrado es cambiarle la voz
"Works fine, double check price.Not happy that I bought it and 2 days later is $20 cheaper but outside of that it has worked fine except it doesn't connect with my Vizio soundbar."
screen size.love it and also purchase ones for my boysso now i can see them once in awhilelove it love it love it
Great New Electronic Toy.I like the display and the ideas it gives on new ways I can use it.
Amazing purchase.Amazing! We love to watch the recipes! And the bigger screen helps!
"Great for googling anything and great price.Love it. Love listening to music, news , weather. Googling recipes that stay on the screen while cooking. It’s very useful and entertaining."
LOVEEEEEE.Got this for Christmas and I LOVEEEEE it! I keep it in my kitchen. I have the echo already and I transferred that to the living room. I plan on getting a dot and an echo show 5 for my daughters room. On Christmas Day I had all devices playing Christmas music through the house!
Review.No issues learn to make adjustments in settings and utilize with others.
"Arrived with screen damaged!I have been waiting for my echo show 8 and when I finally received it and set it up, this was on my screen 😡 I’m extremely frustrated. Now I have to send this one back and wait for another one to come. I ordered two of them and the second one is a gift. I’m happy that I got the damaged one and not the person that I giving one to as a gift."
"Love it.I’m not sure why everyone is complaining so much about the “try asking—“ feature but it’s really not that stressful. I like seeing the prompts at the bottom. Super easy to integrate into your kitchen or main room of your house! I love using it for timers/music/lights. Amazing for playing music, such a good sound. Perfect add on to any home."
Disappointed.Not very happy with this. It’s very glitchy and doesn’t recognize our voices very well......even while in the same room. Disappointed
"Perfect addition to the family!!!I feel that the echo show 8 is a perfect addition to my echo family. It gives me the sound that a music lover such as myself desires along with a nice sized screen full of information. I was going to purchase a new alarm clock before I got the show for Christmas, now i surely don’t need anything more. I am still learning about the echo show 8 and loving it!"
Love our Echo Show 8.We love it. Price was outstanding and great quality for the price.
Good value.Sound is great but not loud enough for movies. Still a good value.
It's ok.It's nice but I feel like for the price it's not much better than the 5. I also can't believe the Netflix app isn't available to the show. Sorta a big reason why I got it. So disappointed...lastly zero cushion in the box to protect the product ups destroyed the packaging and was delivered pretty much open.
Perfect.Definitely a better choice over the smaller Echo Show 5 as far as screen size in concerned.
"Good but a little annoying.I agree with most people that the it’s a little annoying with the words at the bottom of the screen but other than that it’s pretty good, if you can deal with what most are saying about the bottom of the screen than I would recommend it especially if you can get it for under $70 like i did."
Very important piece of equipment in my home.Love the size . One in the kitchen island one in my home office.
"Nice little console that can play movies and music and search the web.Bought this so I can watch movies and play music, nice feature is that the lyrics can be displayed for most of the songs. Can also make phone calls over the internet but ""facetime"" type calls are limited to those who also have an ECHO"
ease of operation and video access to other Echo Show 8.I ordered three more for our family so they may use them with other echo and we can visit on line video and audio with them.  Will see if this works as I think it will.  phone to alexa video was easy and great .  We can visit and see our family now.
Keep Family connected.Grandkids keep in touch with each other.Easy to make family plans.
Why wouldn’t you include echo show 5 functionality??I wish Amazon would include the same clock faces as the echo show 5
Looks beautiful.I'm so excited about this! I want to buy one for my whole family
Perfect integration.I have an Echo Dot in 4 different rooms and they are all connected. It is great.
Echo 8. Make room for this in your life.Great audio and visual commands.  Lots of help visual.  Good quality video voice calls. A winning combination all around
"Would recommend.Overall, happy with my purchase. The bass is overkill when turned up at all. Wish there was access to Netflix or Disney+, but can get Hulu and Prime. I like being able to control my smart home with voice or buttons. The video call between the Alexa shows are good quality. Decent screen size. Nice little device, and a good edition to my growing smart home."
Mediocre Product.Apps are not all that great.  Really not worth spending the money.
"Definitely worth the money.I love my echo show 8, it’s greats product amazon really provides quality products!"
Great product but for the night clock.Wish the clock that displays at night is bigger. I had an Echo Show 5 and was expecting that the clock would display larger with the Show 8. This is very disappointing.
Utilitarian usefulness.Keeps me up on weather and time. Haven't used for anything rlse
The BEST.I love it so much so much it trues off my lights
"Commnication.Screenworks good.  Mic pickup needs to be improved, times no response"
"Drop In's are the best things since sliced bread.The show family I like alot, the show 5,8, and show first gen you just cant beat . I may continue to purchase to interact with other family members in different locations in more states ."
"We love it.We love it I get my recipes , the kids watch movies on it it’s great.."
"Ease of set up surprised me. It just logged in by itself.I have so many devices now, but this is quite special. Love it"
"""Show"" me a better system.I love the system. I use it for all my smart home needs. The only thing that is a drawback is that I can't listen to my audio books on my show and dot at the same time"
"echo show convenient for kitchen.I love having this in my kitchen to view news feeds, recipes and being able to view who is at my front door through my ring camera.  I can watch a video while cooking!"
Echo Show.Easy to check our ring cameras and have the same great Echo music and information.
"echo 8.very easy to set up, but I already have two echo's in the house"
Beautiful sound.When I first heard this unit play music I was mesmerized.  The bass is simply jaw dropping.  I wish the main display was more customizable. That is my only complaint. Something eventually that I expect Amazon might fix.
Happy to have made the purchase!The new Echo Show 8 is terrific.  I would recommend to others.
"Good for an alarm clock, nothing else.It’s basically an overpriced alarm clock, doesn’t do much of anything else"
"You can't disable ""Alexa Try"" at the bottom of the screen.I love all the things this unit can do.  However, to constantly have ""try this, try that"" running at the bottom of the screen is most annoying."
"Take the time to learn.So far I like Alexa ... much more to know, I’m sure it will continue to good and even lots of fun"
Works Great.I got these as gifts for my Son &amp; Daughter.  They loved them!
Crappy servive compared to my other Alexas.It wine stay connected to mutt WiFi.  So it's pretty useless.
So far so good.I replaced a show 5 which had speaker issues with a show 8.  So far so good.
Echo show 8.Works great.  Love that I can look up recipes and have it right there while I cook.
This is awesome.You don’t have to yell at it. She answers way better the Siri
LOVE IT!JUST LEARNING ALL THE THINGS THIS DEVICE CAN DO! ENJOYING THE HD SCREEN! NOW i CAN CHECK MY FRT DOOR CAMERA FROM MY HOME OFFICE!~
Great product easy to pair with smart devices.Great product easy to pair with smart devices. Build in speaker sound great.
excellent product.Wish they offered it as a bundle with the echo but its a great stand
Good for Amazon related content but nothing else.I bought this show thinking my wife and I could access Netflix while in the kitchen. We can watch prime and YouTube so for that it works great. The work around found on the web are useless All other functions work well
"Love the video display.A great juxtaposition...smart home, smart alarm clock, wonderful video interface. Love it!"
"Great sound quality.Vast improvement from the echo show 5. I liked the echo show 5 but I love the echo show 8. Much larger, crisp screen and the sound is soooo much better than the previous model. I would definitely recommend the 8 over the 5. The extra money is totally worth it if you’re looking for great sound quality!"
"Save your $ on the 8"" over the 10"".Got it for xmas and so far so awesome!  I know there are plenty of things to be explored and can't wait"
Great product.Love the screen size.  Only wish it showed a date like my 5 does.
Might buy another one soon.This thing packs a punch when I comes to sound. It exceeded my expectations. It might even sound better than the echo plus (3rd gen). Visuals and functionality are as you'd expect. Overall a great product.
Add one thing.I would like to see the date on the home screen along with the time and weather. But other than that it’s great
Not worth it.Overall very disappointing product. Sound quality is horrible everything sounds muffled. It would never correctly control my smart lights. I also never once got an alarm to work correctly. Returned it and an echo dot gen 3 for same reason. Pay a little extra and stick with google hub.
I love the gallery that rolls 24/7.The pics are crisp and interesting. I also love that it gives you suggestions on what to ask about headlines or recipes. (My settings are for updated news/sport and recipes)
"Better sound, larger screen.Used it to replace an original Show that had screen issues (tearing)."
Love this!Love this!  I have it in the kitchen for recipes and music!
"Awful listening.It has AWFUL listening. My dot heard everything we said perfectly, even my child. The Show misinterprets almost everything we say and we have to yell at it for it to hear us."
"Great Family gift.We ordered this for a family gift for Christmas and decided to put it in our kitchen. It’s so fun and helpful...from music, to podcasts to calendar reminders and grocery lists...loving this new addition to our home."
It’s great.It was advertised to be delivered with an echo dot that was the main reason I purchased it it came with out it
Superb product.Great product. Larger screen than Echi Show 5 is worth it.
"These are awesome!I cannot believe that I waited this long to try these products.  They are awesome and work flawlessly.  Easy set up, easy to use and superb sound quality for a small unit.  Highly recommended."
Sucks—you are forced to read their ads for Alexa features.Inability to turn off “Things to try” messages makes it a non-consensual billboard for Alexa features. Makes me sorry I bought it.
Excelentes pantalla y sonido.Es un hermoso dispositivo para colocar en una sala de estar.
Great addition to our smart devices.This is truly a great device our 8 year old granddaughters communicate with grandmaVery easy to set up We love it
Really really Excellent.So GOOD that we are replacing 2 Echo's with 2 Echo Shows.
Awesome addition to the Alexa line up.I love this Unit. Crystal clear display and that’s what I was looking for. As always it’s Alexa. No more be needed to say. Love it!
Aesthetically pleasing.Wow!What an amazing little powerhouse!Loving it so far!!!
Love it.I am thrilled with this device. I get lots of compliments on the sound quality.
Works great.My wife loves taking this small unit anywhere in the house
Outstanding smart home integration!Easy setup and integration with the rest of my smart devices.
Exactly what it was advertised.It is great!!!! It is exactly what amazon said it was !!!!
"Love my Echo!Love, love, love my Echo! The screen is just the right size."
"Good product.Sound is good, but not exellent. I enjoy the echoshow 8."
"Great buy.It’s pretty awesome. Has tons of features. I use it all the time. It is a little more bulky than I was expecting though. Either way, I’m still glad I bought it. Love it."
"love it. way better than echo show 5.the size is great.  it’s big but not too big. i commonly use for music and the speaker is soo loud. alexa works great and does just what i need. also nice that you can access the internet, making it easy to have recipes or such on it! so much better than my echo show 5 that i have"
Easy to use.Love it... add photos to and understand what she says...
Easy to use.The picture and audio are awesome. Easily connected to my other Alexa devices. Really wish I could get Netflix thiugh
Great picture and easy to set u.We have the echo show 5 but this has a better picture and sound. Our whole family has echo shows so we communicate all the time. Great product.
Replaced my alarm clock with this.Works great for controlling smart home devices. Used as my alarm clock in my bedroom
"Mixing languages needs fixing.A few issues need to be resolved such as voice recognition, specially when pairing up with other languages"
Great.Listening to my music and listening to my Kindle books!!
Good investment/Great speaker.I have 2 of these and love them. This eliminates the need for a separate Bluetooth speaker. The sound on the Alexa show is superb while playing music. I just wish I had more things to ask Alexa to do
Very pleased.I have it bedside so it serves an alarm clock as well as a way to control lighting and other connected devices. I have watched movies and I’m pleased with the picture and sound quality. It will be connected to my Ring door camera soon!!
Awesome!I love watching Prime while I am fixing dinner. It is so easy to use. Technology for dummies!
"Great product! Do not hesitate to purchase.Best product ever!! Great size, sound. White color looks great."
"Confident buy.OMG, sound quality is amazing on the show 8 and the Food Channel apps recipes have made me a confident Chef!  Highly recommend the echo show 8"
"Completely disappointed.Completely disappointed with this purchase. If you want to connect to any app, I would highly suggest getting a small tablet. The echo shows are literally nothing but a glorified echo dot with only the capabilities amazon wants you to have. They let you have prime but don’t let you have any of your other apps."
Love it simple but techy.I mainly use alexia for timers and playing music. But the screen in just big enough to no be too big and it has the camera close function with I really like. When I listen to music it sometimes shows lyrics so it’s like a karaoke machine also. But we can also see our security camera screen on it if we need to!
"Amazing.Amazing. View pictures, watch streaming tv; face time."
Very disappointed.Stopped working after 32 days and had to send for repairs.
"Easy to use and setup. Open the box and plug it in!Great out of the box! Links with our ring doorbell, lights"
Great product.Great product and many different uses from using as alarm clock to watching movies to listening to music.
Seeing is better than just hearing!!!!!I love my new Alexa with 8” screen.  I play music and the words come on screen to follow.  I have it read Bible scriptures and the words are shown.  The visuals really bring so much to the use of Alexa’s spoken words!  I recommend it to everyone!!!!
As described Great display.Great product. Great display and sound. Admin for my theater.
"How to communicate with Alexa &amp; Echo.Wish they'd provide basic terms booklet about how to talk to Echo &amp; Alexa to get a proper response.  We get a lot of ""I don't understand"".  Otherwise, we really like them."
Love the screen.Love this so much more than the echo spot. This makes the number of echo devices in our home 5!!
"So fun.Love. Can talk to my sister in georgia., and see her."
Echo Show 8.I have these in every room and from first generation until now its nice to see all the new features and will continue to upgrade my devices... Thanks
"Great.I like this product. Right screen size, but doesn't show date on home screen like my echo show 5"
Awesome.I love everything about my echo show 8Wonderful sound and nice size screen that I can see with no problem.
Echo Show 8 Shows Out.This Echo Show 8 is Awesome!! I own different Echo devices but this is just fantastic
Handy Tool for My Kitchen.The sound and video quality are great.  I enjoy just learning interesting things from Alexa. The only problem I have is not being able to integrate with my Spectrum TV service.
"Works great, as expected.I like the bigger screen. I continue to learn more ways us use Alexa. Nice device."
Excellent Product.Still trying to get used to it but so far so good. Great sound for such a small speaker.
"Good product/needs stand.Good product, sounds awesome and has a good screen. My main complaint is the height of it makes it necessary to have to stand. The stand should come with it for the price of this product, having to pay another 35 dollars for the stand is ridiculous.! When you buy a tv you get a stand with it."
"Great product!This is our first Alexa enabled product and we absolutely love it! We use it to view recipes, play music and audiobooks, set alarms and timers, control various floor lamps, check weather, and many other things! The voice recognition picks up from about 50' away without having to raise our voice at all. Such a great addition!"
"Great Product.The setup was so simple, love the bigger screen too!"
What I was looking for.Still learning it. But I LOVE it so far. Get to chat with my grandson daily.
"Echo show 8.I love this echo show for Alexa purposes and music. I also love that it shows me recipes on the screen. I haven’t used it to slept here movies. I don’t like the video call so much. The way it’s angled only shows the top of the room, so whoever you call can only see your head and the ceiling."
"Perfect size for my use.Just the right fits and size as an alarm clock, weather report,  news and Alexa control device. Everything is great though the touch screen (and this is typical of amazon devices) are not as seamless as iOS devices. Of course, at the less than $200 price point I can’t compare these two touch devices but i guess I’m spoiled."
Better than IPad. Keeps our kids interested with questions.Our kids love it and we love it. Very easy to use and stationary. Good for primary learning
"Sing along or FaceTime with everyone.This is our favorite and we keep it in the kitchen area. All it does but adds the visual not only on phone calls but when playing music it will list the words of the songs, it is great."
best sound on an echo show.I was surprised at how good the sound was. A good buy.
"Easy to set up. Great sound.Awesome device. Works well,’easy to set up and great sound."
What a great addition to our kitchen!This is both fun and a quick source of info. For us.
Great product.I love it and it talks back lol want on for ever room
"excellent.great unit, I dose everything it claims to and more"
Easy to use and set up.Wish I'd ordered this before the stand alone Alexa.
"Echo Show 8 is an amazing product.I love my Echo Show 8!I bought it for myself. So I can play games with alexa, listen to music, drop in on the house when I'm not home"
"Very happy with my Echo Show 8.Is really easy to set up, working great, I'm having a lot's of fun with it. Customer service very professional.Highly recommend the purchase."
Great addition to our home.Happy with the echo show 8. The size is perfect for me. It recognizes what I say 99% of the time and im happy about that. Good quality speaker with it as well. Looking forward to living with it in the house.
Perfect size Echo Show.I have had all the Echo Shows and this one is the perfect size. Sound quality is good too.
The Best...Excellent device...Can’t believe I have lived this long without it!
Neat Device.Easy to set up and use. The screen quality is excellent.
Does nothing.Unimpressed! Seems like it’s made for a small child.
waist of money.got suck in discovery mode and had to be returned.
"The new show is awesome!I new like a show is amazing, The screen is very clear and the sound is huge! We absolutely love this addition to the house!"
More than pleased.Love it. The speakers on the unit are awesome. I am more than pleased.
"Add the Insurance.Seems to work better than the last one, bought the insurance this time"
"Pretty awesome little device. I’m not sure how I got by without it.I really do love my new show. My only complaints are that it doesn’t stay on video for more than 30 seconds after you pause it (if you’re watching Hulu or YouTube or tubi) and there aren’t more apps available. It also won’t let my view my Wyze cameras, although both say they are connected."
GREAT VOICE RECOGNITION AND GREAT SOUND QUALITY.BEAUTIFUL BIG SCREEN GREAT SOUND QUALITY I LOVE IT
"Fun.The touch and the voice has to be repeated a little more than I would like too. It’s very fun, much better than a dot. I like the news and facts and stuff that displays. However, the wale word needs improvement. With so many Alexa built in devices it’s more complex to change and remember wake words so they all don’t talk at the same time."
Muy bueno.Funciona muy bien tiene un sonido espectacular y trabaja muy bien en español
"works great, with video calls inaddition to regular alexa stuff.I hope it can't see me when I'm not talking on it"
A Must Have connects your Ring front door camera to view live.I absolutely love it!!!  Everyone should have one. I love that you can ask to show front door and it put live ring camera.  I love it!!!!
Most helpful tech.This is the most amazing thing i have ever known!
Did not get the echo dot it was supposed to come with.It was supposed to come with an echo dot.  It did not.
Happy Customer.Love the new echo show 8. Screen is a great size!
Love it!Love having a large display. Perfect for recipes!
"Get one.This is amazing,I love it with all my other devices."
"I like it.It's a good device and I have it hooked up my Ring doorbell and using a routine, it pops up the video of my front door when it detects motion.My complaint is the ads and tips that constantly display on the Screensaver screen that cannot be turned off."
Fun and useful!A great Xmas present for my granddaughter. She loves it!
"Very happy with it.Have to repeat myself more often than my previously owned Echo Spot, but it's still extremely rare. Also, the Echo Show8 is in a slightly different location so that may be the reason.  Overall, I'm very happy with the echo show 8"
easy to install.It's very quick and easy o install . Alexa can do multiply items . I have to learn all the things to do/
Basic functions.Still learning but preliminary time has been outstanding in performance and quality
they must be losing money on this.It is basically an echo dot with an awesome speaker and read along text.  home screen is nice.  Sound quality is absolutely impressive.  I'd pay double.
Works for my use is excellent.We put it in our entertainment center under TV yet we have no problem with communications.
"Speakers are not facing you!Unlike the first edition, three speakers are in the back on this 8th edition. The music is heard from the rear of the echo. It's a bit muffled."
Good.We have to speak a little bit loud to be heard.
"Size is important.This 8"" show has plenty of display area. Great for viewing photos and Ambient Visuals."
It’s okay.It’s like a tablet with about four apps. It’s not quite what I expected
Love it.Love this little piece of technology. I use it daily and bought the 5 for my brother/sister in law and my mother who also love it. The only thing I would change is to allow it to be cordless.
"Very easy to interface with my iPad Alexa app.It’s in my kitchen. I like listening to music, looking up recipes, setting timers."
"Perfect.Can't say a negative comment,  this is worth buying"
Love my new Echo Show.I love my echo show.  Small enough not to take up lots of counter space but big b enough to see recipes.  Could not be happier.
Turn it up.Awesome addition to the family better sound quality than smaller versions
Better sound than the Echo Dots.Disappointing that the firmware doesn't allow for different clock faces or the date.  Has decent sound.
Like being able to easily video call family and friends.I have several echo devices and like all of them.
Converse with family live!!Love the Echo Show! Now I can speak and see my out of town family! It is so much fun!
Doubles as a regular Echo if you don't look at it.But it's nice to have the screen functionality.
Great quality device.It works great the sound quality is better than the 1st gen Show
Great but needs some fine tuning.Product needs better customization of the home screen. Need an option to turn off the Alexa suggestions at the bottom of the screen.
Echo Show 8”.The picture quality is better than the Show 5.
The best of Alexa it is a must have I will be buying one for each room in the house.I love it I would give it 10 Stars if I could.
Beautiful screen clarity.Not being very tech savvy I would like more instructions on how to connect other devices in your home. It does offer ideas for how to use this device. Love the pictures and size of the unit.
"Great for any area of your home.My kids are abscess with Alexa! I enjoy it too, is like having an extra cellphone at your home. If you connect Alexa with your account be aware the it will have access to all your contacts and calls can be made by just asking Alexa to make a call. Also purchases can be done. My kids have done both 😐"
"I got this on cyber Monday at  a discounted price ($79.99) it included a wyze camera. amazing!nice screen size, colors and sound. it does what echo devices do best, fill does bits of info that my brain don't know."
Love the sound.I love the the 8 good respond and great sound
Echo show.I like the Echo Show. Easy to set up and use.
Big upgrade.The video is outstanding. The sound is great.
Great device.Works great. Love that it does recipes for me
Great Product well Done.Love the look and feel o fits design and lightweight as well. Everything works as it should.
Better sound.Excellent product. More than satisfied 5stars
Money well spent.I actually really like it!  I have had an echo dot for a while and hardly used it so I was unsure how much I would use this.  Well turns out all the time!  Speaker sound is great
It shows up.So far so good. Still lots to learn yet. But like it and bought a few couple show 5 on sale and another 8 for family members.
Great for the Kitchen.I already had a dot but wanted to add a show to the kitchen. The size is perfect! Love that I can make a groucrey list right in the kitchen!
Integration between Show and Echo. Improves involvement in asking Alexa questions!WOW many improvements not to mention the accessibility skills are delightful! Enhances Alexia Echo and they work with ease together.
Good upgrade.You cannot take the ask Alexa off the screen
"Beautiful and sounds beyond amazing!I previously had an echo dot and echo spot. THIS IS AMAZING!!!  It sounds wonderful and looks fantastic!  I do not regret this purchase at all! I didn't get a stand, and it still works perfectly on my nightstand."
Defective on arrival.No recourse other than send it back for a refund.
"Love it!Love that it shows the lyrics, to all the songs!  Great sound!"
"Great Product.Still figuring it out, but it looks excellent."
"Very nice if you have any type of integrated camera system.Love it! If thinking about it, it’s with it."
Es muy bueno pero Skype se debe pagar.Lo único malo es que tienes que pagarle a Skype para usarlo sino no funciona
Echo show upgrade.Love these units. I wish it had fire integrated
"This not a device, it is a companion!I love this thing!!! It gives me suggestions to help me integrate it better. I might only know a line from a song and it will tell me the correct title and the singer. I am so glad my son thought enough of me to gift it for Christmas. I am hard-pressed to think of another gift that might be better. Best gift ever."
"You got to have it, is the best.First echo show for me, I love it easy to set up"
That it works for just about anything.It’s nice about the recipes showing the pictures
"The ability to see my family.Bought it to better communicate with my daughter,  we both love it the larger screen works for a senior."
Picture clarity.All as advertised. Could not ask for more.
"Amazing style look to it, goes well in anyroom!I would want to see more apps on it stop the app war with google and apple, but great screen amazing for a kitchen or study, good sound!!!"
"Quality product.It is working great, the screen size is perfect, and sound quality it outstanding"
Great pricce.GREAT PRICE and easy to use very functional
Instructional manual.I wish there was a written manual that could provide a set of instructions on examples of what to tell Alexa on how to pose a question to give a desired answer.
Good product!!I really like the echo show but I would love the camera to face me and not face the ceiling. Overall it is a good product.
The sound!I was extremely impressed with the sound quality when playing music!
Great.Wife loves it. Especially love that there is a cover for the camera.
Can’t get enough of Alexa!Use this product mainly to video call with my granddaughter who lives in another state. Absolutely love it that she can just tell Alexa to call me and she’s only 4!
It’s not as cute or as fun as the Spot.Engineer was to return our call concerning a glitch that won’t permit us to display our city.  Instead it displays a city we don’t live in. This might not bother someone else but it is aggravating.
Diversión en casa.Un producto para divertirse e interactuar
Like it.Like this only wish it would play live tv
This really works!I love these things!  It was easy to link up to my Ring cameras and I just have to tell he what I want to see and the image is there.  No more getting up at night to see that a cat set off the motion detector.
Rocked our world.A whole different world than living with just the echo and dot.
This is the best product for the money.Had no dislike great product have it in my bedroom
Amazing device.It works just as good as the amazon echo dot if not better.
Small but powerful.Love it easy to use. The sounds are great.
There are so many ways to use it.Echo 8 is the perfect size in an area that you don't want to add a TV. Greta sound. Nice picture.
Don’t get it!Can’t get this thing to do much! Had dots and Echo prior with no problems! I’m dumb founded!
"I like it better than the original.Great screen, and great sound. Very happy with this one, actually considering to buy 2 more."
Love the touchscreen.Much better than the dot we upgraded from.
"Grand.Love it for recipes, music, games, weather lots of fun"
Good price.Nice little box and can do video calling.
"Easy to use, great sound!East to set up. Great sound, I love using it as a slide show for my photographs &amp; love the reminders. Also use it to watch YouTube, get the weather, control my smart lighting &amp; to arm my Ring Alarm &amp; cameras."
The Best Thing!Love the size! Not too big not too small.
Ask Alexa anything!!I love that Alexa plays music when asked and shows recipes.  Just ask her anything.
"Excellent.I like it, but stand should be included."
"Love it, I am finally learning the words to every songs.Love the way it interacts with other apps"
"Alexa, Where Have You Been All My Life?Total life improver. Once I got it set up and figured out, this has made a lot of things a wee bit simpler."
"I absolutely LOVE it!I love my Echo Show! I considered the 5"" Echo Show initially, but after viewing it on display in store, I felt that it was way too small for me.  I am glad I went with the 8"" display."
"Love these!!!Love these, but sometimes I doesn’t answer."
Innovation.Love the new “Alexa” with all her glorious features. Go Amazon!
Echo show 8.The quality of the images on the screen is wonderful. The sound quality is unbelievable. I love my Echo show 8.
"its awesome i love it,I purchased two also I purchased the tilt swirl base totally happy.great sound great looks and perfect performance"
Good value.Responsive and reliable for automation and home security.
"Love My New Echo Show!I love my new Echo Show, I love all the features including the drop in where I can see my dogs to check on them!"
"Easy to use.This feature is nice. Easy to use. Sometimes, a little too sensitive"
Much more than a gadget!The Echo is like a personal assistant... Haven't even begun to tap all the information and features.
You need one.Great little product!  Sound quality is good.
Amazing.I love it! The video quality is amazing and it pairs easily with other smart devices.
"Easy to use and great sound.One of my favorites is that when I listen to music you can actually see the lyrics. Boy have I been getting some words wrong over the years, lol. Pretty loud as well, really love it."
Easy to use.Easy set up for beginning of smart house
Love it!I love the sound quality and the ease of use.
"Ring doorbell integration not seamless.On connecting with ring doorbell, I was expecting video to be displayed as soon as someone rings the doorbell. I got this to help my kid see who was at the door before opening. But it defeats the purpose if we have to ask alexa to show who is at the door. Google hub has this feature with its nest doorbell."
Love my Alexa Show.This was a Christmas present from my family  and I absolutely LOVE it. I want another one now for the family room. 😁
Nice.Love the features it's small and neat
Excellent value.Awesome device. Does way more than I expected. All for around $100. Well worth the cost.
"Works with ring doorbell.My spouse mobility in limited, show makes it real easy for her."
Echo Show 8.Great . Works as described. User freindly and works well with my Ring devices and Amazon FireStick
Italian language not implemented.I have bought several Alexa devices so far and they all work perfectly by imposing the Italian language. So I didn't imagine that by buying this echo show 8 I would be faced with the limitation of not having the Italian language. So for me this object is for now only an expensive ornament!
Easy.Work's great. Still learning how to use it.
"Decent price, good quality and great picture.Just what I needed to for my cameras"
Good.Does a better job of listening than the origianl elxa.
"Fantastic device.I love this device!!  So much that I bought the 5, and 10”😊"
Love it!!I love  love love this!! Easy to use understand both my recipes tells me what I need to know
It’s fantastic.It’s awesome love love love it - already set up and using them ordered 2
"Must have for the smart home.Used to connect to the ring doorbell and cameras and to hear the doorbell chime  in the house and answer.  Amazing for cooking and storing recipes, can listen to music at the same time the recipe is on screen. Amazing sound quality and volume."
amazing.what a company only Amazon could do this ! awesome sound and picture . so easy to set up  thanks for such an awesome device
All good.Does not understand my voice sometimes
Very easy to set up and use.This was very easy to set up and use. Straight forward and by the numbers.
Works good.As described. Just started using it
Good deal.Good price and works as good as expected
Easy to integrate.Great communication tool with video
Great.Love the Echo Show. Best Christmas present ever.
Spectacular.Love it great for multiple families
Great device.I have not been able to intergrate with my Ring doorbell but it’s probably something I am doing wrong.
"Size and pict, is good.Touch screen option have more options"
Outstanding product!Great sound! Great product overall!
"Easy to use- wonderful product.I like the 8 inch display- I use it for everything- news, sports and weather."
"Buy this!Great Alexa!  I bought this for my kitchen and now I want the 5"" for the bedroom."
Love.Love! Feeling the need to get a smarter house but it’s great for music and calls!
Excellent Product!!Excellent Product!!!  Love everything!
"Very Nice Unit, having video makes it a hit.Sound is great for its size and it works well. Nothing to complain about."
"Echo Show 8.Got a great price on a Black Friday deal. I initially wanted the Echo 10, but the price was not right. It seems to do everything the 10 does, except the camera does not follow you around when you move."
Loving the Echo Show.We have a lot of Echos in the house and got the Echo Show as a gift. Find it alot better to have the visual added to the Alexa experience. Will look at replacing another Echo with a show in the future.
"works great.Great for reminders, weather, etc."
"Not happy.Returning, it glitches up &amp; like most ppl mention you can’t turn off the suggestions. I called customer care &amp; they flat out told me you cant. I also tried following the directions ppl posted it seems like that would be what you needed to do but it doesn’t do anything they still pop up."
"Great product!!!!I would recommend purchasing the  Echo Show 8 - HD 8"" It allows me to communicate with others who also has the Echo Show. What more can I say... it's driven by Alexa!"
"Firmware updates will hopefully fix Amazon's annoying suggestions.I think that you should be able to turn off Amazon suggestions. This is annoying and unnecessary. Otherwise, it is a pretty great device."
It is fantastic.Love itlove itlove it
See above.I was under the impression that you can video call to people's phone. the only way you can video call to someone's phone is if they have the Alexa app on their phone and it has to be open.
good product.great quick lookup in the kitchen
Clear large screen.Large screen easy to read at night
"Best deal.Best upgrade, live the touch screen only wish I could view Netflix on it but still worth every penny"
"My Favorite Echo Device.Echo Show 8 is useful and entertaining. A great size for the kitchen and helpful when cooking. One in a home office is also handy for a variety of needs. This device is fun for music (although the Echo Studio outshines it for listening), photo viewing, and some of the built-in options."
Not bad for cameras  but terrible for music.It’s basically a tablet glued to a speaker. Works pretty well to show me my cameras. Sound quality for music is terrible though.
Nice display and sound.Does not understand what I am saying sometimes
"overall is great!It integrated well with my Samsung TV, only thing that I didnt like it is that camera is not available from any other device. sound is very good!"
Great addition.I have been recommending it to everyone and intended on getting some for gifts.
Functional device increasing the safety in our home.I like the screen and it can show me the house doors
Alexa Show 8.Love the Show 8. Very sharp picture quality.
Great device for great price.Great sound quality for the price. Will not be using the screen to watch videos but great for video chats with family and dropping in to check on family. So far works great!!!
Security upgrade and information centerpiece.The echo show 8 is a wonderful addition to my security system. It allows me to view my ring cameras almost instantly. Easy set up and extends my echo and echo dots.
voice reconition.Sometimes it won't recognize a command from 10 f away unless I shout loud.
Great value compared to the full sized Echo.Smaller footprint that the full sized Echo with a nice sized screen.  Sound quality is great.
"Junk.Bought this with a wyze camera...  Linked the accounts, and when asking alexa to show the camera it will open the wyze loading screen then go straight back to the home screen..  Such a piece of junk"
Perfect!Perfect! It works like a charm.
"Good Display and Good Sound, but lacks in display details.Happy with the display and sound of this device, but why can't I add a calendar display on the face?  Why is this request not allowed?  My Show 5 has this ability, but my Show 8 does not.I am thinking about returning the Show 8.  I wanted to let you know why.Richard Hernandez"
Stay in touch.Love the show.  Great tip keep in touch with family
Did not receive  the echo dot.The product is great the only thing I did not received my free echo dot I thought it automatically came with the echo show 8 when I ordered it I did not know I was suppose to check a box when I ordered it according to your customer service. I would appreciated if you can still send. Thank you for your help with this
Great product and technology at the offered price point.Excellent product and technology at the price point. Can control entire house from the kitchen. Ability to control Fire Tv in the drawing room is a plus.
It is very easy to set up.great for photo albums and great sound for music.
Love my Echo Show 8.The size and clarity of the display.
"I love it!By far my favorite from all the echos I’ve own. Sound quality is awesome, very easy to use..it’s a nice looking speaker I totally recommend it."
"It's better then I thought it would be!!!It's cool you can listen to music, Pod casts, you can ask her for the local weather and news I really like it a lot!!!"
I have 3 echo Devices and the show 8 by far is my favorite.I love the show 8 it is perfect for my bedroom I have my ring cameras hooked up to it and it have replaced my alarm clock. I herd some of the reviews and got a little discouraged that I ordered one but when I turned it on I was immediately satisfied with my purchase. I goes to sleep and wakes up with me it’s great.
Fantastic.This was a Christmas gift from my daughter and son-in-law. I love it!
Great product!This product is great! Connects to my Ring and all my echo dots.
"Helpful smart home hub.Having fun with it so far! Love the connectivity with the Alexa wall clock gadget and that it keeps my recipe readily available while I’m cooking.  Still troubleshooting establishing and KEEPING connections with our smart devices, but could be because we changed WiFi recently AFTER setting up the Echo 8 initially."
love.My granddaughter love to play the game and it is such a nice size screen and Alexa is great
Looks nice on kitchen counter.Much easier to see more options
Good!Love it!  Fun and convenient!
Lovely Tec.Wonderful way to stay in touch.
Nice addition to media center.Nice addition to media center
Love it so much.So new to this but loving it.
"Came on time, works as advertised.This device works well with the video doorbell and we hope to add other devices soon."
"Another dimension to the Echo Dot.Adds so much more information to Alexa. Recipes, music lyrics, weather and much more."
Easy to set up &amp; grows almost daily in new skills.Quick setup with other Amazon products in the house.  Decided to not use the additional stand.  Easy to connect to wireless.
The 8 is great.Everting about it is perfect.
A must for the wired household.Perfect size to use for a photo frame and good audio quality
Great Gift for any occasion.Christmas gift and I love it❣
It’s easy to use.We bought this for the kitchen and do dining area (open concept) and have just begun using  and are enjoying all this info at our fingertips.
"Don’t buy as a gift.The echo show 8 came in the original box so everyone could what it was (it’s a gift for my parents and I shipped it to their house, since I am coming from out of town) and the package was opened!"
Amazing.So far so good no problems as of yet
Gracias por todo lo recomiendo a ojos cerrados me encanta.Quedé fascinado y encantado Gracias Amazon para mí una de las mejores selección de Alexa
Fun and helpful.Does all it is stated to do.
Great device.I love all my Alexa devices.  I especially like the show 8 it's bigger and it works with my ring which I really like.  I would recommend this product.
Nice product.Nice product and works great.
"New to Alexa.You have to be familiar with how to navigate with Alexa. You must know the correct way to ask for what you want. Otherwise, she can't help you. The volume is great and the screen size is nice. You can stream hulu now too. I still like my new device."
Buy the Echo Show. It’s awesome!I love being able to see the lyrics on the screen as I work in my kitchen. We had the original Echo and this is a wonderful upgrade. With the great trade in program I was able to get this for a steal. ❤️❤️❤️
Great to have a screen.Works well with my ring doorbell.
"Very good, perfect size.Sound is noticeably better than the dots I have. I like the size, kind of a Goldilocks size.  Just right not too small or big. The only real complaint I have is that the screen isn’t very easy to clean. Which is kinda important since I can imagine a lot of people will put these in their kitchen."
"Great.Awesome, not much.more to say!!"
"Great product.Love the Alexa 8. Some times you have to repeat your self, but other than that I love it and the speaker is loud!!!"
"Sometimes bigger is better.I very much like the 8"" screen."
No video resume.It doesn't resume videos.  After it goes off the screen.
"Instructions  do not explane how it works very well.It is in the kitchen and is used for weather reports. news, recipes and music."
"Almost there.The sound is amazing, picked this one over the regular 10in just because of that. Being a screen, it needs more premium video capabilities, as of now just a fancy echo dot. But once it has YouTube, Netflix and all other popular video apps, it will be a 5 star without a question."
Functional.I'm happy with its features
"Plenty of settings features great trade-in upgrade Loved the older model but new one better.I have a Cortana unit, Google unit and Alexa Echo. The Echo response time and how it functions way better than the others."
Fantastic.You will love it l know I do
Echo Show is a go.The voice recognition is well as it always has been. Not like this is a different Alexa from another world. The integration into my airing doorbell and Arllo camera system was easier than I thought it would be. That’s a cool feature.
Alexa.It was a Christmas gift - love it
Works great.Works great. Easy to setup
Awsome.Pretty neat little gadget!
Look at this.I like being able to look at the screen and see the time and weather data.  It’s nice to  see the most recent photos pop up and go through the additions as we update it.
And another one.Got it for my son and his wife.
What’s the big deal?Not impressed at all. Will be returning this
Many configuration problems!!!Echoes are barely compatible with PC versions of Alexa. Moving devices and re-configurations are extremely difficult. You must own your own cell phone (cannot even belong to your employer). Amazon has much work to be done to fix the many problems that I ran into during my configuration effort.
Easy setup.Works great and was easy to integrate and rename devices as I moved older dot to another room
Great product.Great product. Glad I upgraded to an echo with a screen
"Wish there was a way to turn off Alexa suggestions.Has great sound and is a very nice unit. I, like many others, just wish it was my option to control the Alexa suggestions that appear on the screen. Would have given 5 stars if so."
"The speaker was super amazing.Very good speaker, got a decent subwoofer, too good for the price just for the speaker itself plus all the streaming service like Spotify Hulu. Hands down"
"Another amazing echo device.I bought this as my second echo show. I use it on the fireplace mantle to show my family photos mostly, but when guests come over I use it for music and just like the standard show it has fantastic sound quality.  It’s a nice middle ground between the standard show and show 5."
Nice.Nice to have.  No Netflix
Great for reminding him of things.My elderly father loves his
Echo show  8 must have.Echo show 8 is great for its price. Sound quality is perfect.. room filling...Alexa response per your demands...
"Echo Show 8 is GREAT!This is our second show, the first being a Show 2.  Hands down the sound and video quality are far better.  It also beats all of our other dots and echos when we play whole house music.  Looking for an excuse to get another one. 😁"
Great Item!Love it. Utilize it a lot!
"Perfect!Weather,size of letters, questions to ask."
Old lady.It's kind of hard for someone older to try and figure it out. There was no instructions included in box at all. Would help a lot for someone not tech savvy.
Alexia Echo 8.Everything as described and shipped out in a timely manner and so easy to set up
"Try this.....  Make it so we can disable it!!!!Can't stop the ""Alexa try this.."""
Great for family!We can see our Grandson.
Love this for sure.Great item it’s very handy
Echo 8 HD.Product is perfect......
Easy to use!!Thought my husband was silly when he said he wanted this but I must say I love this just as much as I love the echo dots we have! Very easy to use and works great in the kitchen for looking up recipes!!
Great integration of all Alexa.Exceeded all expectations
"I really like it.I think it's pretty cool.  The screen is clear, the sound is good, I hooked it up to my bose so it sounds even better.  The ""try asking Alexa"" thing at the bottom is annoying, I had to go in an make some adjustments in settings and that seem to help a little."
Best gift I ever got myself!I absolutely love this!
Works good.Family really enjoys it
Great product.Like the screen size and Alexa app
"NOOO ""things to try"".I love Alexa but the ""things to try"" always on tbe screen is really annoying. Developers, please remove that!!"
Recomendable.Me gusta mucho puedo ver mis cámaras y mi ring buen sonido
Love Alexa show 8.The show 8 has great sound quality and video quality. I have the show in my kitchen and I use it or recipes and watching hulu.
"Didn’t think I needed one till I got it.I really like this echo show.  Would love to see a way to mount it under a cabinet, but that’s just a request. I recommend the smaller show for the bedroom and the larger show for the kitchen. The sounds (Highs and lows) on the larger echo show are much better than my echo dot or echo tap."
Amazon support doesn’t even know how to operate it.This thing’s a disaster.
"Not really too impressive, seems like it should do more.I don't understand the benefit of this over the echo.  I'm not going to sit and watch an hour long video on an 8 inch screen instead of my 60 inch TV. Maybe I haven't discovered all of the features yet but the echo was just as good in my mind."
Would love to have 10 more.Love it.Use to video chat with family
Say Alexa first.Still learning things it can do but it seams to be a good product I would recommend it it make a really good radio pictures uploaded from my phone seems to be I’m centered but other from that I like it
Good product.Just a smaller version- works just as well
"Works great.Does everything plushas 8"" screen."
The separate stand is unnecessary.The ability to view my front door.
"A must have for anyone who spends time in kitchen cooking.The sound is amazing. I love having this in my kitchen to listen to podcasts, make my grocery lists, and look at recipes. It is a must have in my kitchen."
"Good, but could be better.Works well most of the time. Voice recognition seems not to work as well as other Echo items I own."
Excellent.Haven’t even cracked the surface of what it can do but so far I love it!!
get the aluminum rotating stand $21.99  it fits perfect -looks so cute in my kitchen.I love it!! You are forced to join Amazon PRIME to get all the perks with this deviceMovies and music
Strong audio speaker and video quality. Can be little lightweight.Strong video and audio
Love it.Love having the convenience of seeing who is at the door when in another room
"Very easy to operate and set up!!I am not tech savvy but this was easy and tech support was there to help.  I love the Echo Show HD 8"" smart display and it is very good looking and fits in well with my other electronics."
Won’t work with cam as stated. Or Help Please.Won’t work with cam as stated. Or Help Please
Iphone users stay away from it.No control app for iphone 10s
"Love it, but needs more video options.Love this, but amazon has some work to do providing video screen options.  There are not many skills that use the video, and video streaming doesn’t work other than Amazon. And for some reason, that’s never able to work either.YouTube works well, but doesn’t stay full screen."
Nice unit but not perfect.Seems to have a longer lag time then other Alexa devices
Great sound.Better sound quality than I expected. Alexa is very easy to communicate with.
Not bad.Good looking product
Perfect!We love this device!
Nice quality and very useful product.I put this unit in my bedroom. I can wake up with news or a joke. I have music whenever I want it and i can listen to my audio book at bedtime. The sound quality is superb. I also like the feature the shows the words of a song while the music plays. Well worth the money.
"Awesome Echo Show 8.The Echo Show 8 is awesome.  It can get recipes, information, tell jokes and much more."
Definitely worth it!Love it so much! Great for finding recipes! And playing music! The screen is huge also!
Echo show 8.I like the look of it. Video calling works great.... would buy another.
Thank you Alexa.I love my Echo Show 8! I have had more fun learning everything she can do.Whst I really like about all the Alexa's is you can tell her thank you and she will respond.  I love that!
Bargain!Thanks for making a great product
Love it.Perfect size. Love it
Works as advertised.Works as advertised.
It works.It works great love it
Sound quality is awesome and size is perfect.Perfect size. The 5 Is too small and 10 is too big for the bedroom..also I she 2 10 inch models and the sound quality is almost the same very impressed
"Where r explicit directions found?I wish there were more Clear directions easily found on - well, anywhere! Basic setup was easy, but “fine tuning” has been frustrating. 1st challenge has been learning to use the “tap”. Frustrated with repeated instructions to repeat, with no direction other than “tap”."
Won't work with blink xt2 cameras.Don't buy if you want to use it with the blink xt2 cameras.  Hours lost searching the internet for fixes....3 hours with Amazon customer service and they still don't work.  I expect much better when buying Amazon's newest echo show and newest cameras.  Awful experience.
Perfect device for the job!PERFECT! 3.5 to my klipsch 2.1 speakers.Sounds Great.
"The 8 inch show is the best in size and sound.To have the 8 inch display is great. It’s not too small or too large but just right.The speaker is really great, I love the bass that it produce."
Love it !!!Great product for the kitchen. It's fairly small footprint takes little room from the counter. Sound quality for size is fantastic.
Love it!I love this device!  The set up was way easier than the dots that I have. I like how I can have it set to go to Do Not Disturb mode are a certain time so that the flashing screens won’t disrupt my sleep. It’s the perfect bedside accessory.
Super cool.It’s shown me 3 great recipes randomly that I’ve made and loved!!
HD quality is excellent.Love it.  It does everything and very smart looking.  The screen is crisp and ckeR.  Best echo yet.
"Great new design.Perfect for a kitchen island, love the stand that I purchased for this unit"
Fun to use.Echo how is fun to use
Useful.The Echo Show 8 surprised me with its good bass and loud volume.  Also I find its Youtub functionality better then my Nest display.  Overall I find the Echo Show 8 more useful then the competition.
"Bought for Christmas.At this point I am pleased with it.  Another gadget, but I love gadgets, what can I say. lol. But the display is good and the audio is good."
GREAT PRODUCT AND QUALITY.JUST WHAT I WANTED
Wonderful.I love this device
Quality.My husband loves it
"Echo show has many skills.Excellent sound quality.  Ian still discovering and adding new features,  such as viewing my ring Video Doorbell."
"Echo Show 8 a Hit Right Out of the Box.Being an early adopter one expects a few bugs in a new device.  However, the Echo Show 8  has so far  performed flawlessly.  Setup is a breeze, the touch screen is a nice feature and the sound is very good.  Have not yet tried the camera."
Fast connect to Ring cameras.I like the fact that my Ring cameras connect faster than to my phone.
Very Cool.Picture Is great. Sound is clear. Nice to be able to watch movies/YouTube  while doing chores in kitchen.
"The Mic is not as sensitive as previous generations.Mic is not sensitive as previous generation, I have to yell at it all the time."
Nice size.It’s nice I like itNeeds work on sound I was watching YouTube andSound was muffled at times then it would clear up.I had to keep adjust sound.Other than that it works great
"Awesome!Another perfect addition to my ever growing collection of Alexa products. I’m extremely impressed with the sound and functionality of the Show 8! So glad I decided to buy it,"
Love this product.I was interested in the Show line after seeing a friends.  I was happy to find a great deal and I do not regret the purchase. It works perfect in my little house and I can hear it from every room.
It works very well.This devise is so neat because you can see things on the screen rather than not like the echo regular version. The show is a much better device because of the show factor.
"Alexa.It's extremely convenient to have Alexa in my home.  It's just nice to be able to know certain things before I begin my day, and she affords me this."
Great buy.Easy to set up and use. Connected to all my Ring cameras
Another Great Amazon Product.Easy setup. Another great Amazon product. Came with a free Echo Dot.
Should have gotten one sooner.Love love love this.
Work for the whole Amazon devices.Great value for the money
"Excellent.It is well worth the money. You can ask Alexa a lot of questions that you may not know answers to. I bought two of them one for myself and one for my daughter that moved to Las Vegas,Si we can call each other and FaceTime."
Great product.My family loves it
Sound is great.Love Alexa show.
Great to have.Love it so much.
No complaints!!!Good product !!!
Love Alexa.I love it and highly recommend it.
The Visuals are wonderful.Loved it. Works great. Great Sound
I love watching Amazon Prime shows at my desk.I have an older version in my kitchen and like it so much I wanted one for my office. I also bought several for Christmas gifts.
Super cool.This thing is bad@$$.
Show 8 is really cool.I love that it integrated into my ring doorbell and will show when someone is at my door.
Best Echo yet!I absolutely love my new Echo Show 8. The picture quality is clear and it has so many features. I’m thinking of getting another one for my kitchen.
Love it!Great upgrade from old alexa.
It is a quality item to own!I like it all!  It is great!  Shows words to songs so the grandkids can sing along!  Shows the weather for the week!  Will play music with good quality speaker!  We are enjoying it!
Easy to use.So far - all good.
"Love my Echo Show.I love my echo show. One in kitchen, one in master bath. So convieient."
Works grest.Great for any home
Most importantly it works.So far its pretty good an awesome upgrade from the Echo Dot Family
No Large Clock/Day/Date settings.No clock settings?  I want a large clock with day and date. There are no setting for choosing this like on the Show 5.
"Great product.I love this product, a great addition to our home."
Handy home assistant.The show looks and sounds great and interstates all of our smart home devices really easily with the free app. I was a little unsure how much I’d use it but now I use it every day.
Gift.Christmas gift
It was good but more subscription is needed to have more options.Music options are some what limited and maybe I Dont know how to navigate further
Nice.Like everything so far as expected
Great promotion.Gift for myself
Very easy to use .Love it . Works great .
"Awesome  device.It is everything I wanted in a device.however,the only complaint I have is.  I can't pull up my favorites and use the all recipes app like I do on my phone."
"Nice device, wish it had better controls.I dislike the music controls or rather the lack of.  Overall, I really like the device."
Video not the best.Video is not very good I can’t even tell who it is when I do
Works great.Whole family enjoys
"Great unit with neat features.I wasn’t sure I really had any use for the show, but now that I have it I love it. I really like the sound quality and having a screen."
Eco show 8 is fantastic.I love my Eco show 8 it's wonderful I love all the features and skills Alexa has I love the 8 inch HD screen

"Easy hook up.Great product. Shipped a couple days before Black Friday and then was less expensive. No refund, but still like the product."
Best one yet.It’s very loud where you wanted to be understands everything a lot better than all my other Alexis.
"Works great.It's sounds much better then the echo 5 and also the a echo spot , which to me was a waste of time."
Alexa is the ideal device to have.I like Alexa because easy t get to.very knowledgeable and explain things into detail.
Nice item.What i dont like is the price dropped twice in one month and i missed out on the final price drop
Love it.I love my show 8.there are so many thingsYou can do with her.Iam still learning all it can do
"Aunque a veces no reconoce la voz inmediatamente, me gusta.La pantalla es grande se ve perfectamente el audio es excelente"

Perfect screen size.Nice product
Handy and useful!!Love this little screen in the kitchen. So many uses!!
"has picture screen saver.i haven't  really used it much, but I like the clock and the sound is good.  I looked up a few recipes and it worked great, is going to be very useful in the kitchen"
Perfect size.It's awesome
Like the Echo Show 8.Like everything about the echo show 8.
"Great device for the family.Im actually really surprises at this device.  It works extremly well, and helps keep the kid occupied"
Easy to use!Works great
User friendly.Easy setup.
"Love it.I can listen to my music, it shows recipes, I have my family's pics in it. Check the weather. Learning new things every day"
Easy.I live alone so it’s almost like I have company! I love being able to ask Alexa questions rather than having to look things up on my phone. She finds the types of music I’m in the mood for.
"Nice size screen!I traded in my original echo show for this new 8"" model. I really think it is an upgrade and sounds great!"
Perfect.GoodPerfect
Great product.Love that I can have recipes at my fingertips.
Great improvement over the Echo show 5.I recently bought the echo show 8 and I’m really amazed at how big of an improvement it is over the echo show 5 that I have! The text and and resolution is much sharper and the sound quality is noticeably better. Loving it so far.
Must buy.Great product!
Must have this in your home.Very interactive
Easy to set up; easy to use.Kitchen questions
I love it!I love it. Only comment is I have to talk fairly loud for her to hear me it seems.
"Decent for some things and pretty bad for others.If asked to play spotify or pandora alexa says ""cannot play music at this time"" if asked to show a world map it says ""um, i'm having trouble with that request.""  It will take pictures and call others with an amazon echo show, but at this point it is more of a glorified digital picture frame."
Gift.Was a gift
Happy with purchase.I replaced my FM clock radio with it.  Sound quality is very good.
It's AMAZING!It does everything!
Really like my Echo Show 8.Great screen with very good audio.
Good.Works well
It is well worth the money . It does a lot.I love my echo show 8
so much better than the Google version.the Alexa version integrates so much better than Google 7 in.
Echo show 8.Love my echo show 8 order 2 more...using for smart home.
Love my echo show 8.I love it. Just received it. And so far so good.
A good product.They Work
Easy and it hooks to Ring.Love it !
Echo show.I love it
Great product.It works great and plan on buying another

Great items.Love this
Great.Love it! The size is great and sound much improved. My whole place is alexa!
Muchas gracias feliz año nuevo.Me agrado es muy bueno y mas xq esta en español
"Annoying “Try Alexa, xxxxxxxxxx” at bottom.Cannot remove the “Try...” at the bottom of the screen. Otherwise it works like other Echo devices. it doesn’t seem to hear as well as my Echo. I like being able to watch Hulu but Netflix is not an option. I haven’t tried doing a video call with anyone yet."
Great product.Wish it worked like a home security camera. Don’t understand why it didn’t.
Easy.Easy to set up love that it dims in evening
How to troubleshoot.Casual family interaction. The sound keeps failing. We had to use cell phone to hear the conversation while watching each other on video
Great Quality.Am very happy with my purchase.Wanted to purchase another but the price went up from $79 to $99.I’ll wait until price drops
Works perfect with Ring!I bought this for my husband for Christmas mainly to sync up with our Ring doorbells.  Now he can command “show me the front door” without scrambling to find his phone.  All from the comfort of his recliner.  lol
great.Gave this to my wife for Christmas and she loves it. She is bed bound and we set up our ring door bell so she can answer it and see who  is there  from her bed or chair. She just loves it and use it all the time.
The show 8 is awesome with a great size and quality sound.The set up was quick and easy. It was larger than I expected. I was very pleased. The quality of the sound is better than the Show 5.  I love my show 5 and love my show 8 even more. I highly recommend the show 8.
That amazon has my back!So easy to set up. I bought this for my sister who struggles with anxiety so bad. When I gave it to her with books downloaded she was thrilled. She has been reading it and has occupied her thoughts.
"It does everything.Love love love it, amazing!"
For the entire family!Love it!
GREAT PRODUCT AND QUALITY.LOVE IT
Great product.Nice product I really enjoy the knowledge and that it can be insink with ring this also goes for the 5
wow.love it
"Amazing quality and great price.I opted to upgrade my older model for this one and I love it, sound quality is great and I love the size of the screen."
Great.Great product
Alexia.Love it
I LOVE IT!!!I love it!! The sound is awesome and the videos are real HD quality. Why did I wait so long?!!
Great alarm.I love using my voice to set my alarm and turn it off in the morning
"Welcome home, Echo Show!I purchased one of these and put it on my kitchen counter, and I love it! The screen looks great! The bass is pretty loud, but not in a bad way! The sound is amazing. Love everything about it! (The sound can also be turned up A LOT if you wish to do so 🤣)"
Works great.Love it
Lots of fun.Love it
Fantastic item.The HD 8” screen is great. Color is very good and has a clear images
😎.Great echo 🙂
Love it!I had the old Echo first edition love it and this one is even better!
Amazing..Love this Product. Is the best item I've ever had
Nice pic and good sound.Works great
Works Perfectly!Exactly what we needed in our kitchen.
Love it so far.I wished it had more skills. Still learning how to use it
Very happy.Super easy setup. I have already used it to look up recipes and get news.  The screen is a good size and the picture is very clear.  I sound for music is great
Love it.Love it! Easy to set up and integrate with the rest of our devices.
Love it!!!!Excellent!!!!
"Cool gadgets, we are still learning.We really love our new echo devices, although we are still learning how to really use them. My only complaint about the echo show 8 is that it is angled up, so if I use it to drop in on our dog throughout the day, all I can see is ceiling."
"Well worth it.I love having this in my kitchen. Listen to music while I cook, look at my recipes, see who’s at the front door and so much more. The voice recognition is so much better and is only getting better. It’s a great add to my Echo family of 10."
"Easy Setup.I found this the most natural Echo device to set up so far. Everything I have tried so far works flawlessly. It tells me my commute, my daily itinerary, makes calls, tells me when dinner is ready, and when to wakeup. I am excited to try more features as I find the time."
Love it.Don’t like the suggestions that appear during slideshow if pictures
I was amazed of the quality .It was everything I expect of it .I was amazed of the quality
Sorasy to set up.Great unit. Lots of fun
Absolutely the best!!Love everthing about this product. So many possibilities
Works as designed.Nice easy to read screen.
great.great
Great addition.Great
Easy.Loving the echo show ... I still have a lot to learn re: different skills.  Came out of the box so easy to set up &amp; use!  Great product!
"Amazing HD screen and sound quality.I love it... got my echo show 8 on Black Friday for a good price and we all very happy in the house, great HD resolution on the screen and good sound quality."
sounds great.Sounds great
"Good display, seemless integrtuin with WiFi network.The only thing I don't like is the things to try running accross the bottom of the screen that I have not been able to disable"
"love this Echo Show.I love having the ability to see you cooking info. I do wish they could get rid of the ""Try This"" scrolling across the screen."
Nice upgrade.I really enjoy this product. I’ve had the echo dot for a few years now and decided to upgrade to the Show 8 as a gift for myself this Christmas. It has a lot of cool features and the screen is nice and big. Would recommend!
Nice screen that shows my pictures and words to songs.Dilute the Try Alexa but I can live with it
"Great value for $$.We love it I’d  it recommend the dot since price isn’t much more spring for this one we love it.  Photos run constantly can pretty much do anything you want with it.  Music, news, recipe whatever"
Great.Cool
Took awhile to get but it works well.I bought this 8” show to connect my blink cameras too it was a breeze I already had a Dot .. The show is doing very well it’s working great. Definitely worth the money I can’t even watch YouTube on my google browser and Alexa even does my search love it
Love Our Show.I had an Echo and moved up to the Show.  It's like going from the Stone Age to the Industrial Revolution.  Easy to use and my family loves it.  We use it for everything.
"Size.Nice size with great sound,perfect fit the kitchen area"
"Love it.Love to have in kitchen to get recipes, listen to music and watch amazon show. Small enough to fit on counter and space saver"
It's Good.Great
Sound and Display.So much fun. Love the new Echo Show.
I can give it another name so Alexa does no get coffee nfuse.Love it
Both fulfilled my expectations.Great deal.
Love this thing!Love this thing! Love how interactive this is.
"apps are only for android, not pc.I don't like it. I don't have android"
"Great assistant.Sharp screen, nice for have in the kitchen"
Great Product.This is a perfect device to have in the kitchen.!  Love it!
Very satisfactory. Setup process required customer support.Set up did not go smoothly. Had to call customer support to overcome setup error messages.
Great product but needs improved clock features.Would have given it a five star but disappointed that you can not adjust the clock. I use this as my alarm clock and would love to be able to adjust the clock to a bigger setting like I do in my echo show 5.
Great gift great.Great gift
OK.Good
Mr.Like it
Product is very good.Product very good overall but the camera quality is very poor. It is my understanding that it is only 1 MP. Software improvements is making product better.
Glad i have it.Connects to all my smart home items and Ring Video Doorbell with no issues.
Echo with video.Its an echo with a video screen. The news videos are nice. Being able to search and see recipes has been great. Sound has been great.
I love my Alexa!My first one and LOVE IT!  My mom is older and is assisted living. With this Alexa I can drop in on her and see/talk to her.  I also quit setting my phone alarm as Alexa wakes me up daily now!
I use it Daily!I’ve had trouble pulling up recipes off my Pinterest account. It may just be me not knowing how.
Great!!Love it!  Been using lots of recipes and asking lots of questions.  It's great!!!
"Setting it up is easy... if you know what you are doing.Setting it up was more than a notion.  Remember, you have to have the name or numbers of your WiFi and that password. You also then need to have a password for Amazon.Works well. We need to learn more about it....  Googling instructions were not very helpful."
Perfect size.Great product
"Very nice.Have the Show 5, but wanted a larger screen.  Very nice device"
Excellent!I like it. Excellent Christmas gift.
"Could be better.Video is good, sound is weak. Sometimes it does not pick up my wife's voice or understand her, I have no problems. Since it is hers and she uses it for our smart home devices it does get frustrating having to repeat herself often to get things done."
Great product.I bought all the kids and myself one for Christmas....We all live states away....its so nice to be able to see and talk with them!...clear picture and voice....awesome speaker ..we play music alot and were amazed by the sound quality!
"Great smart screen to interact and control alexa.Very good quality, good sound and it is nice that you can see the information on screen. I wish it had more feature and smarter search and web interface. The screen size 8 inch is perfect for its function."
Made great gifts!I bought 3 of them. One for myself and one for both of my adult children as Christmas gifts. So much fun to be able to talk to my 3 yr. old granddaughter. Picture and sound quality are great!
Fantastic!Love this! Especially how it displays my Amazon photos !
"Great at a glance device.Great product, great features. Love everything about it!"
Nice.Good product easy set and programming. Came ready to go.
"Big Screen.Upgraded from dot and couldn't be more happy, with large screen its to watch videos and do more."
"Good product, needs work on the voice, word and phrase recognition. Speaker and screen very good.Voice/word recognition is really bad.  I had a shoe prior and never had problems.  Maybe mine is broken and needs repair."
Pleased.Very pleased
Easy access to information!I do love the easy access to information. Alexa has a very soothing voice - not digital :o) and the suggestions for topics of interest makes it easy to stay current! Great gift!
I can call my daughter and chat most times the teenage grand children are there.It has been a blast having the echo 8 I  received it for a gift and enjoy echo everyday music weather from all over pictures quizes just fun.
Comes without stand !!!$35 extra for a piece of plastic to hold it up: really!?  Went from an enjoyable purchase to a rip off
Great.We purchased one for all in family.  My son who is handicapped and bedridden is able to use his device due to Alexa he really enjoys the fact that he can ask her for time.  lol more independence for him.
"Fun, helpful and affordable.Works great and turned out to be a lot more useful than I imagined"
Love.Love it. Able to watch Philo and youtube in bed
Communication.We liked everything about it
Easy setup.Purchased for each of my daughters and myself so we can stay in touch. I plan on buying a fourth for my mother .
"Great sound. And fun to use. But do not like the scrolling ""try"" suggestions on the screen.The scrolling suggestions at the bottom of the scene is really annoying. And there is no way to get rid of them. I'm actually thinking of returning it because of this. Also you cannot change the clock like you can on the echo show 5."
"If you have the Echo Dot or Speaker, you NEED the Echo Show!My 4th Show purchase to add to my Dots in every room...bought for myself, friends and famiy. Need I say more?!"
Great product.Still in process of learning different things. Use it a lot for music. Sound is great. It was given to me at Christmas. already had 3 echos.
ease of set up &amp; use.First time users we both like it &amp; would have no hesitation in recommending it
Get it!This is a great device. The sound quality is great and it is very easy to use alone and with the app.
Echo.Buen producto
Echo.Buen producto
Bad sound.You need to turn up the volume almost 3/4 of the way to get loud enough sound and music sounds lousy ..unbalanced and muddy .. wish I had NOT bought it
Very good but missing something!Very good product. I purchased three shows for the holidays to keep in touch with family. (Show 5 for me and for my daughter at college; Show 8 for my parents) Not 5-star because I thought I could do a 3 way call but that option is not available.
Not as good as I would have hoped for weather.Poor formatting for weather.  Was hoping it would better show the weather for the full week and be more adjustable.
Nice screen and easy to set up.Very easy to set up. Looks great.
"Love it , but some minor issues.If theres only one critique I have,  its that alexa offers to teach me skills that i really don't care about."
Great gift!My family loves it!
One of the most helpful gadgets I’ve ever gotten.I love its ability going through my pictures that I have forgotten about it’s ability to play music with printed lyrics  it will play YouTube instructions for While I am Knitting I’ll give me a recipe in the kitchen
Echo Show is really Great.Great device Great Holiday valueLove the video and sound quality
Great communication device.Works great.
Easy intergraded with other Amazon deviced.Love it!!
Good product for $100.Great speaker. Voice recognition is pretty good.
"Great sound!I like be able to download my pictures to the Echo Show 8. Also works great with the Ring doorbell 2. The sound quality is awesome and connects easily with my other echo devices. So far, I haven’t found anything to dislike about it and I’m glad I purchased it."
New echo show.This item is so awesome
Fun!I love it!  She has good recipes and is always giving me ideas.  What did I do with out her
Neat machine.Terrific display and easy to set up
"easy setup.I like the echo 8, was easy to setup all I had to do was plug it in, found my account and was ready to go. I like it's a bigger screen for me to see."
You need it!!!We absolutely love this device...super smart and keep us organized. Connects to all our smart home devices! Love it!!
ALEXA  IS A+++++++.PERFECT
Echo Show 8 is Great.Love it
"Nice.Works nicely, convenient for cooking directions"
Music and Youtube.Alexa needs to respond more because it seems as if she’s hard headed. I need a booklet next time on how to synchronize my day instead of ask Alexa this and that
LOVE love it!!!I absolutely love this! Got one for christmas and had to buy another. You will not regret this purchase!!!!
"I love the sound system.I couldn't believe the sound system on this unit is excellent! Alexa is great! She is able to recognize my broken English voice perfectly. It is better than my car's navigation system. Every time I ask, it keeps asking me what did you say. LOL"
Amazing!!I purchased this as a gift and the recipients are more than happy with it!! It’s so amazing just how many things “Alexa” can do and the sound is great! Great item and will definitely be purchasing one for myself!!
Outstanding!We love it! So easy to set up and operate. We use mainly to talk and see our grandkids!  Good job Amazon!!!
pretty nice product.love being able to video call with my daughter and see my grand baby
Get the show 5.I got this for the bigger display...well you get that but you can't have a big clock and display the date like you can with the 5. I'm sending this trash back and keeping the 5. Honestly can't wait for Apple to make one will probably best the rest by a mile.
"Very easy to set up, whole family loves it!!Can not say enough good things about this item!! The whole family uses it. I got my parents the smaller one but, I should’ve gotten them the larger one. Very easy to set up"
Help.Love my Alexa. I’m having a real hard time figuring out all the things it can do.
Best addition to our home set up.Love it!!
Perfect.My wife loves it
"Great Product.The sound quality was better than expected. For music, I use it mostly for background noise in the kitchen and have the stereo for anything serious. Connection to other smart devices was easy to setup. The display was the right size for me, not too small and not too large!"
"Well done!Very nice smart home device. Pretty clear picture. We put one upstairs and one downstairs, so we can use them as an intercom in the shop. Very cool! Hooked up to our other smart devices seamlessly."
Must have in every household.Love it
Poor speaker Quality and respond when ask to turn off.Speakers not that great and sometimes it wouldn’t respond when you asked to turn it off.
Great Product!!Excellent product. It expands Echo's functionality tremendously. I like the ability to view linked video camera feed almost instantly rather than relying on an involved process via smartphone. Great Job! Bruce H
they are very helpful.Love it
Perfect for someone with mobility issues.Love it!
Good.Great product. Like the screen size. I have like 20 available echo products. They all work as described. I wish we could download apps like YouTube
Great device for the price.I really like the Echo Show 8.  Camera resolution could be better.
So cool.Rightly priced. I like the experience so far
Great bass.Love everything about it!
Best alexa product.I love the screen size. I have it in my kitchen and use it to make meals. Screen is clear and speakers areperfect.
Good product.Good quality for video calls.  Very simple setup.
Works great.Love it
great in the kitchen.does not hear as good.
Great.Great
"Love Alexa Show!I have Alexa in my kitchen and after I looked up recipes several times, Alexa started send me suggestions. I like the ability to call others and see them on the Show. Much more to learn about Alexa, but so far, I like having Alexa close by!"
"Echo Show 8 appears to have a delay in responding, or just doesn't hear well!Echo Show 8 has a hearing problem!  I'd love to know how this can be fixed.  It seems that I have to raise my voice (almost yell) for this device to respond."
👍.👍
Great product.Very easy set-up and loads of features.
Need update.I can’t believe if it doesn’t start ring doorbell video automatically when someone on the door !Plus resolution for uploaded pictures is not good atall
"Amazoning device, still reading manual.Trying to set up options. Hopefully I can get itCompletely set up."
"Alexa with Visuals.Perfect for kitchen to look up recipes, see your photos uploaded to amazon, ask questions, play games.  It is a very useful appliance."
Absolutely wonderful!I absolutely LOVE this size! It is so much easier to read and I look forward to using it daily.
"Only hears brief commands.It only answers when asking simple questions, like weather, wind speed; setting alarms, timers and calendar events"
Good sound. Like how it's like a karaoke with the words to the songs.Just exploring what it can do. Love the karaoke words to the songs. Would be nice for get togethers. Good sound for a smaller speaker. Good for recipes and saving ones I like. Over all I like it.
"Good product.Good dice, good sound, easy navigation"
Pretty useless unless you have IoT devices to control.Didn't appear to be easy way to learn how to use. Shouldn't have to buy a book from Amazon. Or spend hours googling help tips. Also need space to place device that's near an outlet.
Notable Improvements.Sound is night and day compared to my original Echo Show. Voice recognition has drastically improved. Screen has improved.
Gift.Bought it for dad video chats!
Perfect.Works great and love it
Love it.Love it can view all my cameras and make phone calls
Voice Recognition not as good as expected.N/a
Very good quality.I like the weather and all my pictures that it goes threw. I would buy again.
Nice display.I wish I could watch Netflix and DirecTV.
"Ease of set up.Very easy to set up and connect with my echo. Connected to my photos ,which provides a rolling screen of pictures.  Connected to my ring door bell as well"
Would buy again.Pretty
Awesome!!!!!Love the product
So awesome!!!!Wow this thing is cool!!! And so cheap for everything it does!!! Must have!!
Great.Upgraded from a five to an eight.  This is just awesome!
"AWESOME GADGET!Great for Amazon Music playlists, Recipe videos, alarms!"
Very cool. Alexa on steroids.Works great
A must have. Easy to face time the family.Good price.
Ease of use.We love this product so far. Haven’t had time to do much with it yet though.
Loved it.Love it
Sounds better than my BIG Jambox!!!The sound quality on this things is terrific.
Love this product!Love this product.
Good Value and very helpful!We love The Echo 8. Easy to use and easy setup! Only thing is Alexa voice is hard to understand. Voice is muffled. Wish I could change voice.
Awesome.  And great sound.Amazing product. wish I had one in each room
Reboot.Everything was great till last night it would not listen to me . Had to pull the plug for it to stop. Would not stop when requested. Hopefully it works out because it’s what I was looking for
Love it!Super easy to set up
Good product.Good product
Great product.I still have a lot to learn about the Echo show but the sound and video quality are excellent. Love this new addition to my home.
Ease of use.I would like a command to play music for set period of time.  Such a command would be most useful when I want to listen to music at bedtime.
Love the new 8” frame.Perfect for the family room.  Love seeing family pics scrolling by!
Love it.I live it so far. But it won’t connect my iphone calendar to this product.
Good for casual use on your smart devices.Good for my needs so far. Mostly using it for a dedicated clock instead of waking my phone. I can tell it to show which ever security camera i want (Arlo and Ring).
Echo show.Great product. I replaced my echo with it and love it.
Thumps up.I like it
Love it.Sound quality is great and easy setup.
Fun.It’s nice having a screen to look  at.
All other features working well ?Sometime Alexa does not hear my commandIt’s like I have to wake her up ????
screen size is biger then i thought.this is perfect for what I wanted to use it for and work great with my other echo
Be sure to voice train your Echo Show 8.Voice recognition is not always spot on. Alexa initiates w/o being summoned. I am impressed with the screen displays.
"Needs more downloads/apps.Great product overall BUT I wish it was compatible with more apps, saves last viewed page, easier access to internet."
Room size matters.Great size for my kitchen and living room.
I like it.Nice gift.
good quality.I like it case it shows what you ask for and you can read and see the questions and answers. Also its great for my living room.
Alexa show Echo 8 so far so good.I got my Alexa Shoe Echo 8 a week ago. It was easy to set up and has been fun to use. My only complaint is sometimes I have to stand right over it for her to hear what I said.
Love the Echo Show 8.Love it!!!
It's amazing!Easy to hook-up and nice visual and good sound.
Perfect size...very nic!The Echo show 8 is perfect for what I wanted it for.....to show my Ring cameras.
Not happy.Clock and display is not like the show 5. I like the show 5 but want bigger screen like the show 8. Wish you could of combined the two it would have been perfect.
Fair.A fair product. can improve on voice recognition
Worth every penny.Security w  music
Enjoy talking to something that gives me the right answers!I have the Echo Show 5 in my bedroom and I bought myself the Echo Show 8 for my office.  I like the larger display during  while working.
Great gift for moms.This was a xmas gift and since my mom cannot wait until xmas she was able to open this item.  She absolutely loves it and now is adding more devices in the house
Nice.Works great
Sound is amazing!Love using this device!!Makes life easier👍🏼
Decent.Definitely get this if looking at lower end models.
Enjoying it.We are enjoying it.
"Quality product!Very easy to use, got it to stay in touch with family. Love it!"
Love it.The best Echo yey
"Alexa Show 8.I'm really enjoying the Show 8. The recipes are right there in front of you. Also, like the time and weather always showing. I enjoy being able to see the people I talk to on the phone. Great product."
"Excellent to manage different alarms.I like how it shows you the cameras, the sound is great."
Fun and works GREAT.Love it
"Love it!!!Love this device (echo show 8), I actually bought 4 of this and gave it to my kids. I'm enjoying this very much, the sound, video calling my kids, recipes and much more."
new.just leaning
Great product.Everything is great. Wish it was a hair louder. Good product worth the money!
Awesome.Still learning all it can do.
"Please add Clock Customization to show day of week  on Home Screen.I bought this for a family member with dementia. One of the big issues with dementia is knowing the day, date and time. There is no option for adding the Day on the Home Screen. Please update and correct and it will deserve a 5 star. Thank You."
Excellent product.Arrived on time and was easy to set up
Not bad but needs work on application fuctionality with compatible devices.Honestly i like the echo show 8 better than the five.for sound quality alone but it gives me issues linking and viewing the camera that it cam with due to alexa always having problems but other than that its a convenient device.
Speaker sounds great.cant install Youtube and Netflix.
"Alexa Love.Yes! More cool Alexa stuff. We like ours, so we bought more as Christmas Gifts. Easy set up. Not obtrusive."
Our second. Love it!We have a show 10 already. Love this for a secondary location. Love the speaker linking ability between our 3 echo devices.
Love it!!!We love our new Echo!  Its been great and very convenient and easy to use!!!
Faltan muchas cosas por arreglar.No me convence 😢
"It’s great for news updates and trending topics!This product was received as a gift. My husband and I love it! It’s fun to use and is probably very useful for reminders, though it is new to us and we have not yet reached that level."
"It's OK.Had the old tower hub (No screen) and it was awesome, upgraded to the Show...It doesn't seem to undestand me as well, misses commands often...It's OK..But not as good as the other one."
Me fascina.Exelente
"Works.Best mid viewer for my system. Works well with Alexa and ring, which is what I need."
Great product.This is our first Alexa capable device and we have been so happy with it. One of the big reasons for our purchase was because it integrates with our Arlo cameras. I would recommend it!
Great addition to my Echo collection.Very easy to set up. has a great screen. Set up in my kitchen. The screen is large enough to watch prime videos.
Cost. Extra extra cost.Had to pay extra for stand.
Impressive!!I didn’t think I could like Alexa any more.....but this is just great to have video and this things that she can show you and look up are faster than you could ever type.
"Great source of information at hand!Very useful, with a limitless source of information. I used in the kitchen where i can ask everything i don't know, from recipes to traffic info, weather and anything. The display is superb and i can see the details very crisp. Thanks Amazon."
"Awesome Echo.The Echo Show 8 exceeded my expectations. The sound quality is much better than I was expecting, and the microphones pick up from good distance. Very pleased"
The screen.It's just a nice device
Get this one.Love it
Great Product!!We are excited to add this to our family of Amazon products!
Good sound.Small clock numbers
"Great purchase.Bass sound is good, screen is better than the small echo 5. I am not annoyed with the “try alexa” comment by other reviewers. You can  remove it by making it black screen in settings."
"No issues with Alexa....It's like having a girlfriend but this girlfriend doesn't get angry doesn't put ya down you ask her to do something and it's done, my blood pressure doesn't go up...✌️✌️"
"It's amazing! And if you fall down and need help,  just ask it to make a call for you!! Win win!I love this!"
Just what I needed :).Perfect size for my kitchen counter.
"Great device for entertainment.It works very well, it is used in our living room for a device to provide entertainment. We play music on it for the family to enjoy, we use it as a timer when cooking. The display constantly shows weather, news, ect. Overall is works great for our purpose."
A must-have.I had one of the originals and this is definitely a step up better sound and a sleeker look
So far it's a really good deal.So far really like it.
ALEXIA ECHO 8 GREAT TO HAVE AROUND!Excellent.  We did have to reset her once but AMAZON customers service helped &amp; told us what to do. So no problems since. We got the Echo 8. Like it a lot. But you need to download the Alexa APP. to get even more benefits. 🙂
Echo show 8 is awesome.First time getting Alexa device. Bought it to pair with ring doorbell and baby camera. Works great! Love this thing. The smart home guard is a major plus too. Alexa can listen for glass break or smoke detector or co detector.
Love it!Great way to centralize various smart home items. The game skills are fun and the sound quality is impressive.
Worth the price.I upgraded from a gen one show and am very happy with the 8
"Great deal great product,.Love my Alexa 8 show, very much fun"
Easy to use !Excellent product!
Only one issue.Background pictures “slideshow” seems to freeze every couple days requiring a power cycle.
Very good.This product is very good so far it’s very easy to use very nice and I love the big screen
Satisfied.I love it . I also like the screen on it with the clock to look at the time and also set alarm on it to wake up in the morning.  And also you can add photos on it and look at app's on it too I'm very happy and  Satisfied with it to 🤗🤗🤗🤗
Excellent product.Excellent product. I use it for my 90 year old dad who lives in an assisted living facility. He has trouble using a phone but loves this Echo Show 8. We use the “drop in” function and he doesn’t have to do anything to answer our video call.
"Great Echo Show.Alexa is great. Just once in a while, while playing Song Quiz, it skipped or just didn’t respond the way it should. Other than that, love having the Echo Show 8. Decent screen size."
I still love it.I don't like that I have to figure out how to word things just right in order to get Alexa to follow my orders.  I also didn't know I had to have a cable provider to use the NBC app and I do not.
Nice size and big screen.Good speaker and nice screen. Voice recognition is still need to improve.
Good.I really like it.
"Great echo show 8.This is great if u have the ring doorbell u can answer it through the show echo I like because it has a screen so u can see the weather ,Youtube an other thing u may like an the size of the echo screen is good"
Great Value.Sound and picture quality was good
Could have been 5 stars.With a firmware upgrade this product could be close to perfect.1) Option to stop Alexa suggestions on Home screen2) Clock not customizable like Echo Show 5
Great product.Liked everything.
Constant annoying suggestions on bottom of the screen.Unable to turn off the constant annoying suggestions on the bottom of the screen.  If I was able to turn that feature off this would very good in most everything else.
Good.Speaker
Perfect size.Nice size loved the new color my 5th echo
Alexa is my new best friend!I love it!
Nice.Nice
Very fun technology!I love to hear music in the kitchen and find new recipes!
Loving it.Enjoy it and it’s pretty sweet to see video of the security on this smart screen
So far it’s ok.It’s ok still learning this model
echo 8.does not rotate thru my pictures . keeps having a black  screen. wont show the weather only the time and black screen.
"Life changing,smile.Life changing,my elderly parents live two states away . Now their granddaughter son and the entire family can reach the grandparents and see them anytime the smile from my parents it's the best"
Awesome product.Awesome product
Couldn't get any better!I love it.  This is my first Alexa operated device and it's awesome.  I just ordered an echo dot.
"New gen.It’s my first amazon echo, I love it!"
Great move up!Its pretty cool! I updated from the dot to the show and i have to say I'm pleased. The big plus from this device is being able to video call other people with another alexa show!
It should be more geared for older folks with out a cell phone.Dont like you can not add a list of phone numbers in it manually I have a 80 year old mother inlaw  and has no cell phone and could really use it if you could install a contact list manually..
0 customization! No Date on home screen!?There is zero customization. I don’t understand why there is not more to customize. The home screen doesn’t even show the date.... the 5 was way better. And actually I believe the clock is smaller on the 8!
Highly recommend.We bought some for Christmas presents for our out of state parents. My little girl has enjoyed being able to video chats whenever she likes
Happy with Show!Thought I would take the leap and am glad I did.
Awesome.Great better then expected
Great value.Absolutely in love with this. It is such a great addition to our Alexa home systems. I didn’t know how I’d like it but it’s easy to work and effective.
Not impressed.I just don’t like it . It’s definitely not what it’s cracked up to me . I’m also still learning it and isn’t finding much that I like . I already have two dots and they do the same . What’s the point of having a screen .
Great buy.This was a great buy there are so many things you can do with it.  The voice commands are easy.
"I love my Echo Show 8 - HD!I love the size of the screen. I have it in my kitchen,  so i can enjoy music while preparing dinner or pull up a recipe if needed.  I check the weather and listen to the news. Most importantly, i can video chat with the grandchildren."
A must have product.Like simplicity of gaining quick answers to questions.
Great quality.We just love it. So easy to use. Quality is fantastic.
I like it.For excellent
Love the screen to ask questions and get how to videos.Wish we could interact with iphone users.
Love it.I got this as a gift for Christmas and I love it! I haven’t gotten to fully explore all it can do but so far I am enjoying it!
"Terrific item.Great device! I keep it in the kitchen, where it is used from everything to playing music/videos while we fiddle around doing kitchen things, to looking up recipes and making shopping lists."
Everything.I used this product for information
"Great features for the money.This device really has no downfalls.  Good sound and video quality, good intergration into our home network, and plenty of cool features."
Super.My only issue is my unlimited music from my other echo has not synced to my echo show. Great picture quailty and sound . Voice recognition is on point . Love it💗
"Excellent suggestions!Alexa gives lots of suggestions and one of the most helpful is the timer use and the shopping lists I think of while I'm getting breakfast, lunch and dinner and never take time to jot down."
"Alexa says not as advertised, I'm not sure.This was advertised as having a video camera, When I activated it Alexa said it does not have a video camera.  Is it a hardware or software problem? Don't know, I returned it."
Just love it.😍
I love the Echo.I love listening to music on it and I love dropping in on my grandchildren.
It’s so simple to use.Perfect little gift for Christmas to chat with my grandkids
Excelente.Me encantó! Solo que no puedo usar el messenger de Facebook
"Still learning.I am definitely enjoying my Alexia Show but I am still learning how to get the most out of it. I can't wait to learn it all,"
Nice.Size
"“Alexa, try...” Leave me alooooone!Really disappointing you can’t get rid of the recommendations at the bottom of the screen. Also this model doesn’t seem to understand what I’m saying as well as the original echo, which we switched from"
Great product.This has worked great for us. The sound quality is really good. Very happy with the purchase
"The best home hub.This is exellent I Love everything about it helps me from my commutes, to my recepies, shows, weather everything and Alexa is excellent"
It doesn't work and won't reset.The Echo Show eight worked fine until I tried to use Music everywhere with my other echos and Echo dots. The device went dark and did not work any longer. I did a factory reset and the whole thing still does not work at all. It won't even turn on.
It is a fancy Alexa with a screen.I was so disappointed because I thought it could do much more! I bought it for my kids to watch tv and movies as well as listen to music. I already returned it!
very well made.great device for parties and up to date news
Great little gizmo.Very nice features and works very well
"ECHO SHOW!Product is awesome! Easy to operate and very easy to understand! Bought as a Christmas present for my parents, they thinks it’s great and are excited to start buying smart home appliances and switches!"
no issues.I have it doing so much. Love it
Great.Great product I have 4 echoes in the house and this is my first show 8 great size happy we didn’t get the show 5 the 8 fits great everywhere the sound it’s good not as good as my echo 3rd gen but it’s not bad for bedroom or kitchen
Love it!Great product
"My Alexa preview.I have come to depend on Alexa for my daily calendar, my grocery list and my entertainment. Don't think I could get along without her."
Echo.We love it &amp; great to heat music everywhere
Nice.I like it works grate
Great screen size 8in.Sounds good videos are clear screen is bigger and better
Useful and Fun device.Great device.  Linked easily to my Ring doorbell and music.  Also enjoy using it to video chat with grandkids.
Great.Does a great job
Photo Display.Love displaying pictures.
"Glad I got this.This is a great device. I was hesitant to buy one of these at first. but I'm glad I did. Having an answer at the ready for almost any question, is extremely helpful. All the skills are great as well."
"Very useful.I'm really enjoying my new Echo Show.  I keep it in the kitchen and use it to look up recipes, play Italian restaurant music while I cook, and most importantly, enjoy face time with my granddaughter."
"What's going on around me.I love this product! I use it for the weather, my ring doorbell, music. Well, I guess I use it for everything."
Nice screen size and convenient!It works great! Video call is very clear and I love that I can switch the camera button off when not in use! Happy with my purchase!
Works well.Bought this for my mother . It’s easy to set up and use
"Good for building a smart home.Good quality sound and good screen. Might be a bit much if you are on the fence about Alexa, but if you are wanting a central focus for your smart home, it is a good idea"
Great.Had it for awhile now and everything’s working great. Seems to be just the right size. Not to big and not to small. Fits my nightstand perfectly and still leaves room for other things.
Works as it should.Only had it working about a week. In the week we had it my wife can video chat with her family 3 thousand miles away with no problem and the sound quality is pretty good.
Very good sound.Wish it would play YouTube TV
Nice choice!Love the speaker! Talk about improvement!
Good sound and great screen.I like it a lot . Is great for my office.
It’s good but not great.It’s good but not great. It doesn’t like to play videos at all
My familt loves it!My kids interact with it. Everyone that comes to visit is impressed by it. I love that I can watch a show listen to music while in the kitchen. It also helps to not have to look up recipes on my phone. I would reccomend this product to anyone.
"Fun!I love it!  Thank you for making the time lathe enough for me to see (poor vision!!)!  As a bonus, I love seeing my favorite photos displayed!!"
"No matter your age this is something you should have.Love, love this.  Never had any intention of getting an Echo Show but my son had other ideas and I’m so glad.  We have had so much fun and ordered 2 more Echo Dot’s for other rooms.  It is awesome."
"Nice upgrade from the first gen.Upgraded my echo show first gen to this, and it’s better in every way"
Great device for information.I love my echo show 8 inch. I loved being able to go to the Amazon store and compare the different models and accessories and the staff was a big help. I'm a 100% satisfied with the quality and the functionality
"Alexa echo show.Love it, though I now have 4 Alexa in the house would be great if one could rename them"
"Alexa is handy and essential assistance, calling service is awful/.Like to interact with it and the automatic display suggestions.dislike the speaker is behind so sometimes it doesn’t respond as much as accurateUse for news, cooking and so much more😍"
Just what I wanted.Very happy with it easy to set up
Works good.Like it a lot
An excellent product!An excellent product. I’m very pleased.
It's everything in more what they said about the it.I used to sit home anytime I want information a  Recipe or to know the weather outside I just ask Alexa really like it
"Better than expected.Great so far, bought on black friday with old echo trade in. Good deal, good sound and screen is better than expected."
"More Video Support.I hate that you can’t make the suggestions go away from the bottom of the screen. Would also be nice if it added support for Hulu, Netflix and Plex rather than having to use the browser as a work around. Overall very pleased with this though"
"Love the Echo Show 8.Love my Echo Show 8! I love the big screen! Great picture and sound quality, you can set alarms and timers, add thing to your shopping list, and see the weather and news, and listen to music! I do wish the YouTube TV app was supported on it!"
"Reading my books.Love having it turn my lights on. I broke my arm walking up the stairs with no lights on, fell down the stairs."
"Alexa, show me my ring front camera!Clear and crisp audio and video. Alexa is very handy in a lot of ways.  I'm placing it in my kitchen island so i can view my ring pro doorbell front camera and answer it right away."
Great in help in the kitchen!We love our Echo Show. We put it in the kitchen and it's helpful with  bringing up recipes and playing music with lyrics so I can sing while I am washing dishes! Excellent purchase!
"Very versatile. What can't it do?With a beautiful screen, good audio and a smart system it has it all in one. I was able to hook up my camera so I can see who is at the door, and it also has room to room features.  It was well worth the price."
Love it.An essential addition to our Alexa collection
Lame.Alexa's ability to control the apps is pretty limited. Can only use your voice to open things.. Not to mention my alexa keeps displaying things in spanish. I dont speak spanish nor do I want to..
Good product!Appears to have good sounds and video.
Awesome product.Awesome product.
I never ordered this item!I never ordered this item.
"BUY, BUY, BUY, BUY, BUY!!! N’stantly with Alexa.Buy it.. You’ll love Alexa and all the wonderful things she can do!"
Good purchase.Exceptional sound and great display.  Very easy to set up.  Delivery was three days late.  Why Amazon uses the United States Postal Service for delivery is beyond me.
"Love it, love it, love it.This is great for connecting with family face to face. It is also good for cooking and playing the piano."
Bringing up recipes.I like that I can bring a recipe up while cooking plus having music playing in the background.
"Two and half thumbs up.Easy set up, performed as described, and user friendly can’t ask for anything more.."
"Love it exactly what I wanted.Love it, perfect size for my kitchen. Great sound quality!"
Love Alexa Products.I got this for my mom and dad because we live 4 hours away and thought it would be nice for the kids and them to video call and we love it so much we have the echo show 5 and we got them the 8.
New echo.Using it for music and various other things
Fun so far.Great screen. Lots of helpful topics. It frustratingly did not recognize our Amazon music but we are working on it.
Expensive.I wish it was a little cheaper
Top Notch!Works better then expected. Love it!
"Great Size, not too small &amp; not too big.The 8 inch screen is just the perfect size."
Your customer service people don't know everything.called customer service twice and was told the Echo 8 would not do what I had ordered it for - my 3rd got me someone who knew what they were doing. Echo Show 8 works great for what I wanted it to do. Thanks
Overall this is a great option. We've had a 5 for a while now and this is most definitely a step up.It seems that is still struggles with bandwidth sharing when in a video call.That being said it is pretty good overall.
Very nice.Very nice 👍🏻
Easy to setup.I just love everything about this device.
Excellent gift.It was a Christmas gift and they love it.
Helpful.Very helpful
A helpful tool for everyday use.I use this product for anything and everything from cooking instructional videos to weather updates to playing music or adding items to my shopping list.  I also love to use it for video chatting with family and friends.
amazing.is very enjoyable
Great.Works and sounds great
"Best Alexa device so far.Purchased for Christmas, really like the upgrade from Echo dot!"
Soud is very good.does a lot of things  more than expected
"Enjoyable.I enjoy this as an alarm clock, a means to chat with my kids and to stream music and radio and it does all of these things like a champ"
"It is very helpful for certain tasks around the house, and we can see our granddaughter anytime!There were a few questions that she did not know the answer for. We got it to talk to our granddaughter and had some difficulty answering when she called or calling her. I think it will be great once we get the hang of how to do that."
No automatic live stream.There is no way to set up an automatic live stream when someone pressed ring doorbell.
"Great for the price.I have the 10 and the 8 is almost the same. Easier access to videos (recipes, you tube etc) would be better. I always have to scroll through and type searches like a tablet to find what I was looking for"
"Great product.Great product, but the custom screen need to improved"
All in one.Great video tutorials excellent sound and interaction
"Ultimately the best Alexa product I’ve used.I have mine right by my gaming setup, and I’ve been using it to look up stuff for my legend of Zelda breath of the wild gameplay. It is great, it always gets way I say right, great sound quality. And overall best Alexa product I own."
"Awesome product.I use for smart lights and plugs. Works awesome, perfect size"
Do not buy!I give these no stars. Very misleading in how they work. Very disappointing. I will be returning both of them!
See The Future.I love it.  Replaced an earlier Echo model in kitchen and vast improvement.  Love the sound quality
"Incredibly sound with visuals.Better than I expected,I can watch youtube,Facebook,plus more"
Great product!I would highly recommend this item to anyone.
Great.Great
Fantastic.Great
"Get the Echo show.I love the Echo products. I just did an upgrade to my Echo show and on top of the discount for my old device,  I also received an additional 30.00 for preordering which I thought was awesome, thank you!"
Drop In so-so.No problem with Elexa 10. Got an Elexa 8 unit but had to return it because drop-in party complained constantly losing sound.  New Elexa 8 has similar problem but not as bad.
She loves it.My wife loves it. She can see her grand kids every day. They call to say good night. Hope that don't last. They wake me up. It is a great product.
Amazing sound quality.Great product!  Sound is awesome!  Use it to see my Ring cameras &amp; usual Alexa requests.
Quality Alexa is smart!User friendly!
"Best one yet.Has an amazing speaker, and shows lyrics to songs as they play, can hear you from across the room, plus is a great cooking companion!"
Awesome Device.Love this device. Using it as a picture fram is a huge plus.
Love it!I love everything about this device ❤
Exactly what I wanted.Very easy to set up and use.  Like that I can video chat with my old man with it.  Very nice picture and amazing sounds.
"Recommend.It's a good purchase, part music machine, part video phone (other party has to have a amazon show). I would recommend it at anytime."
Easy set-up in no time!I love being able to easily call my son and see and talk to my grandchildren.
Very easy to setup and use.Control of other devices in the house can be at time spotty
Delivers.This is perfect for a nightstand! Delivered on expectation.
"Best echo show so far.This Echo show device is the perfect size. Big enough to see at a distance,  yet small enough that it doesn't take up a lot of room."
Awesome.I don’t know how I ever lived without the Alexa Echo Show. I love it. I have 4 of them.❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
"Works but buggy.Wonderful device, but for some reason when you tell it to exit or close NPR it goes to the home screen and continues playing. You have to tell it to pause and then close or exit. Really wish this bug would be fixed."
Easy to add to existing Alexa management.Works great!
Amazing.Love it I highly recommend it
Good but could be better!I like everything about the device except that it's  not portable so you can't use it unless it's plugged in to outlet.
Easy to use.Easy to use.
Worth the money and I love it.Love it
Current promotion better deal wont honor from less than 30 day purchase.Amazon will not honor current promotion with free echo dot
can read recipe.Like the size of screen. Much better then the 5 inch. Sound pretty good too.
It’s a great product.I like the size and quality. I use this one in my bedroom. I use it to watch shows sometimes at night. I also use it to listen to music a lot and to turn lights on or off and to adjust my thermostat.
"Not all I was looking for.Impressive sound, but it seems that the buk of available skills are geared toward family and children. I'm still exploring,  but I'd like to see more productivity  skils. I don't need the babysitting skills at all."
Great product.The echo is amazing. I bought it because is compatible with ring and Arlo security systems. It works great.
Great with the ring cameras!Great picture quality!
Great product.Picture quality good.  Lots of things that it can do.  I just have difficulty on what to say to get her to do the right thing (operator issue).
"Needs better camera.Great way to stay connected, only complaint is camera small,  needs lots of light for clear video,  not a broad view either,  you have to be right in front."
"Easy to access information visually.Provides the same information that I love getting from Alexa, but with visual access."
Satisfied customer.I love it
Loves it!Great!
Great viewing!Perfect to see my granddaughter!!!
Awesome!!!I absolutely love it!
Amazing.Amazing product. I love it!
Nice product.Very cool product.  Like using it for making list and checking the weather.  Also sound quality is very good for a small speaker.
Great.It is great especially with the ring integration
.My husband loved
Great in the kitchen.Excellent product. My wife uses it in the kitchen all the time. Sound is amazing for its size.
Can't go wrong.I love the sound and the 8 inch display.
A step up from my Echo.So far so good.  I have only had it a short time and have not used many of the features.  I bought one for my brother and sister in law also.
Nice device.Nice device for the price.
Another great Alexa product.Very satisfied with this item. Synced my blink cameras with Alexa. Works fantastic.
Small upgrade from Dot for big price.Picks up my voice much less reliably than a 2nd gen Echo Dot. Have had intermittent audio quality issues while playing audio over Bluetooth. Find the screen less useful than I thought it would be.
Great buy.Great sound over the echo dot.  I love video calling.  I can call from Alexa app and talk to my kids at home.I love playing my music on it.  Highly recommend it.
"Accessing video content.I hate the fact that you can't chose which episode you want to watch from Prime, Hulu, ect...I mean what were you thinking Amazon???????????"
"Great Picture Quality.I love my Echo show 8.  It replaced the original Echo Show.  It is much faster, has great video, and sound quality."
"Skills are super basic algorithms.Alexa is not as smart as they boast. Many requests are easily figured out, just say Alexa before every command. Like getting the attention of a person before you tell them something"
"Received an old one.The package seal was opened, there is a scratch on the screen, and stains on the bottom of the speaker. Amazon repackage things and still consider them new.  Shameful."
Awesome Echo.Best Echo show yet!
nice.simple set up
Not that receptice.The LED screen is really good. Sound is good--but this Echo Show  is hard up at hearing. Very difficult to relay commands and we always have to make her stop and repeat the command. Amazon Echo is still better.
Love the Echo Show 8.Really like 8” screen. So easy to read. Does everything echo dot does plus shows information visually. Can sit in front of it and tell it to take a picture. So cool. Just keep finding things it can do. Love it!
"Great Product.I am so glad I ordered this product, I have not learned a lot about it but so far great investment.  I have it hooked to my Ring Doorbell and other products for a better view.  I’m thinking of ordering another."
Very easy to follow instructions for most anything you want to program.I love the display! Family photos from my phone rotate on the devise all day long.
El tamaño.Muy fácil de usar me encantó su tamaño
This thing is fantastic.There is nothing negative about this thing I have two.
Decent device.Wake command is weaker than Echo Dots in the house. Having to speak louder activates other Alexa devices. Really a shame. No voice access to YouTube is a bummer. Display is nice and sound quality is decent though not amazing.
It a solid Alexa voice command tool. My elderly mother loves to sing with it when it shows lyrics.It's great. It does a good job.
"Your gonna fall in love with Alexa.I don't know how I lived without Alexa...now, if I could just get her to do the dishes. I really enjoy the recipes, music, weather updates and shopping."
Recipe music utube.Love it
Excellent.Love all aspects of it. Better than I thought
Very good.Kids love it
Really enjoy my echo show 8.Really enjoy the convenience of being able to speak to Alexa and have her deliver what I request.  I have very poor vision.  Really enjoy my Audible books and music.
Love this!Love this! Easy to use and great additional features!
"Echodot 8.My wife bought this Echo 8 for me and i am very happy. The installation was esay,  I was able to integrate my Sono soundbar, my ring doorbell camera and two bulbs light in my bath. .i llove it. You can ask Alexa everything ."
Echo 8.Works great and love it
"Two thumbs up!Daughter loves it.. User friendly, and set up was super easy."
It makes a busy life easier.The pictures on the screen and touch screen.
Good size.Price was great and I really like the 8 inch design.
Works perfect!Works perfect and the video is great
Fun device.It is a fun function to have in the house. I wish it connected to more music services. But overall fun and helpful addition to our house.
Great smart home integration.Added three of these to the house for a total of nine. One in almost every room. My house is not just smart it has a degree in service. Great product.
"Good enough for a teenager, and that's not easy.Got it for my daughter, she loves it"
"Worth it.You need to train this to your voice.  Other than that, picture quality with Ring audio quality are outstanding."
Fun for the whole family.Couldn’t wait to open the box! So far we have streamed prime videos and listened to holiday music; great quality all around.
"Very satisfied after a month of use.Been using the Show 8 for about a month and so far so good. Sound and screen quality is good, and it adds some nice capabilities above and beyond my Dot. Recently bought It for my parents and sister as well."
"More than just entertainment, a lifestyle tool!Have enjoyed music, photo albums, lists, and integration of Echo Show with Echo Dot to play the same music in multiple locations.  Have had a couple instances where Alexa did not recognize what I was saying."
Valuable product.Loved getting answers to all my questions without as much as a push of a button. Only problem was the alexa voice disappeared after a week and had to reset to default.. I hope this isn't a regular occurence.
Best value.Perfect addition to my smart home. Easy set up works perfect
"Try it, I guarantee you’re going to love it!Great get any info with just asking. I don’t mind the ads , sound is very good."
What a great gift!Received this from my daughter and her husband for Christmas.  It is wonderful.  I love the music available.  It lifts spirits and takes me back to my younger days.  It was very easy to learn.
"Friends with same unit, we can see each other on a phone call.Awesome product. Shows song lyrics and I use it with my Ring doorbell"
"Love my echo show 8.Great design, works like a charm, so easy to setup!"
Big display.Well built
the screen and sound.Love it!!!
Better than expected.Screen quality is better than expected. Use it in dining room. Sound quality is very good
Good quality.Like this a lot so far
"Great sound quality and easy set up.I have 5 of these at my house and they’re awesome! I have 4 echo dots in my 2 studios and love them . Easy set up, we use for alarms , timers , weather , music and so much more!"
Love being able to watch movies and play music.Works well i love it
Cool.I love this! She has skillz!
"Excelente, tener Alexa en casa.Me ha gustado mucho, muy eficiente para las recetas que necesito cocinar, y hacer listas y recordarme lo que necesito hacer.  Excelente."
Cool.Works just fine
Works gr.Mostly music of different types. Various questions for info
Definitely met my expectations.I’m very pleased with the Echo Show 8.  The screen is a perfect size.  I have it in the kitchen &amp; have already used the recipe function.  Excellent dish!  Looking forward to trying other functions/features.
Works as advertised!Works as advertised. Also works great with the Ring Doorbell system.
"Alexa show rocks.Easy setup, adds a new side to Alexa!  Adding Photos was super easy."
Customer service in Spanish.Everything is good except you don’t have customer service in Spanish
"Great, except for the video calling feature.The Video calling is extremely pixelated at times."
"Love It!I have several Echo devices and I like them all but I really like the Echo Show the best. Easy to interact with the screen recipes, song lyrics etc."
Awesome.Awesome device
Great buy!This was easy to set up.. great sound and quality picture!
Need.Need to include a hub in the next generation one.
Perfect.Traded in my Echo show second generation and this is far superior!!
Works great!I love the larger screen. It makes an excellent smart clock for my bedroom. Alexa works great along with my Ring doorbell on the Echo.
Love it!Love my echo show! At a glance every morning I see weather and ask how my commute will be into Seattle. Way better than staring at my phone.  We have in kitchen.
I'm Pleased.Satisfied.  Does what I expected.
Recipes.Cannot video call. Also my wife has all her recipes in an album on her IPad and we tried to view them on the Echo Show but we’re too small to read.
Not good.Brand new and it was defective. Alexa never responded. Was on the phone with support for an hour and we reset it 5 times.
ok.ok
Nothing.Love it
The clock is terrible.I don't like that you can't see the clock that easy at night
Lyrics.I would like to be able to download apps and see lyrics displayed.
Hello Alexa.Very cool product happy with this Christmas gift
"Echo show 8.I use the echo show 8 to play music, news, sport scores and weather. The one area that needs improvement is the clock display. I wish I was able to customize the clock by color and bigger number display."
"Great Display.Really enjoying this Alexa device! Nice sound, easy to use, just plain fun!"
Amazing !!!!!!I love my eco show 8 my son gave me this for Christmas and every day I get amazed by Alexa . I already have 2 in my house .and bought 8 more for gifts and every body are very happy with it
Need to read directions.Wish it understood what I was saying better. Like Amelia from IPsoft. It’s good for asking what the weather is and asking for recipes and sometimes music. I will hve to look up best uses of it to get best use out of it
Echo Show 8.This is a perfect size for the night stand or desk. Connection with Alexa devices was easy. Works well with a Nest thermostat. Sound quality using the Amazon music is great.
Good Show.Works as good as the other show devices
Easier read out for my old eyes.Love the larger display!
Perfect!!Exactly what we wanted!!
"Best birthday gift.Easy to use, sound is fantastic, nice to have FaceTime with son who bought it for me."
Best Christmas gift.I absolutely love it! I keep mine in the kitchen so when I cook I can lookup recipes listen to music catch up in the news play games! It’s absolutely amazing one of my favorite Christmas gifts this year
Great screen.Nothing to dislike. It's great.
WONDERFUL PRODUCT.LOVE IT!!!!
"The best.Outstanding sound! Shows my pictures, shows me news and recipes, and so much more, you can even play trivia games with your friends and family! It’s worth it!"
Useful gadget.Very useful information by just asking
Echo Show 8.I’m enjoying this product very much - highly recommend to anyone
I would buy again.I liked it so much that I ordered 2.  It works with my Wyze cameras.  I am amazed at the skills it has.  My only complaint would be the bass sound that is hard to regulate.
Good product.Good product...I use for music mostly.
"Perfect size.Love the Echo 8...the 8"" screen is just the perfect size for me....I have a Echo 5 in the bedroom and the Echo 8 in the kitchen...love them both"
Not only bigger screen and also better sound quality and easier to use.Better than Echo Show 5
Very Cool.It's like the Echo Dot but with a screen which I have not fully figured out yet. I had trouble locating the 8 so I could transfer music from my older Dot to the Show 8. It's cool though!
Alexa 8.I like the large screen
I love it!Love the size of the echo show 8 for my kitchen counter. It’s great for pulling up recipes and music and all the hands free things it allows me to do while I’m cooking/cleaning in there.
Great gift.Great gift
Super excited.My friend has one and I’m so excited about finally getting one.
Got to have it.Wow
Needs better information to set up device's and info.Kinda hard to set for your contacts.
"Makes cooking and shopping easier.Love my new echo showUse it for recipes, shopping lists, and video chatting with my grandchildren.  Trying Alexa guard soon"
Fun “learning curve” but having fun with it!I’ve had to reboot it twice. First time was because there was no sound coming out of it. Second time was because it wouldn’t  stop playing amazon music. I’ve only had it for two weeks.
Echo 8 in Kitchen.This product is really useful and enjoyable. Love the fact that the screen is not too big or not too small. Recipes on demand is awesome in the kitchen area. Glad I chose this over the google hub. Well done amazon.
Good but has limitations.Loses connection to other devices (i.e. Roomba and Ring) but great when connected.
Very good sound and picture quality!I thought the Echo show has very good sound and picture quality. I liked how the show is able to list the directions of a recipe and the ability to watch quality videos.
"Get it before the price goes back up!Too bad you cant remove the “Try Alexa” from the bottom of the screen, it is quite annoying. Other than that its worth the price."
"Makes life easier.Makes my life easier. Since I am disabled it helps to have some things, like lights, connected to it and just tell Alexa turn them on or off."
Nice.Nice sound when music is being played but not a fan of the scrolling notifications on the lower part of the screen.
Amazing device.Easy to setup
Love.Just very fun
"Must to get most from your time.Easy to setup, easy to use. Perfect blend of looks and performance. The skills have also become so much better. A great purchase to go up few notches in efficiency and effectiveness."
"Alexa for the bedroom.Love this Alexa, great for bedroom"
"So far she's handy.The device was surprisingly loud when playing music. Alexa does well identifying news stories I ask about, and how-to requests such as ""show me how to wrap a present."""
"Interesting.Just learning all it can do is a lot, interesting when you find something fun like it read us “A night before Christmas” the Peter Paul and Mary version."
I love the it.it is bigger
Better updated model.This is our second Echo Show.  I love the feature for turning the camera off.  Thank you!!
Does not stay hooked up to internet log can not use alexa.Gave it as a gift and they are loving  it
Easy setup!Just started using but I  like it so far.
Don't waste your money.So far it had no luck with this period no matter what I ask it to do she tells me I don't know that period I wanted it mostly sigh could pull up a recipe in my kitchen and I find it to be a large waste of money.
Excelente.Excelente producto
"Super easy integration into my existing home automation system!Totally love this for kitchen use!  I can see recipes, and play music, and even see who's at the front door, all without touching anything!"
Helpful and fun.So far has been a great product for the whole family. I bought this for my wife but my kids enjoy it just much. Alexa has become our go to for any information needed.
Echo show.So fun to have music at the ready and I love using the list and reminder feature
Keep making good products.I really like it very much.It really has good sound and good bass also.
"good buy.very good helps out while cooking too ,but i only ordered one n recieved one echo show 8, so why are you showing me two again?"
Works great.Love it.  Love that it plays amazon prime and you tube.  Nice addition to kitchen.  Can view recipes and watch while cooking.
"Perfect gift.Very nice, size of a tablet and easy setup. Bought the stand to go with it and looks good"
Got it on sale never looked back.Love this product
Got to go big for the right price.Love the size for the $$
Video chat doesn't always work but otherwise great quality.Gave 2 of these as gifts. Wanted for the calling feature mostly which works 90% of the time. Still a good product overall just seems to be a few kinks.
Love it.Definitely recommend the show 8 vs show 5. Picture quality is great and love the option of personal photos for the background. Great sound. We love it.
So easy to use! Great sound quality!Love my new Echo Show 8!! I highly recommend this to anyone who is even  interested. It works great!
Super great item!!Perfect size! Enjoyable to look at and use.Glad I bought it!!
Sound better on the echo 5.Just wonder why the sound is better on the echo five then it is on the eight?
Perfect size!The first one was so good had to get another one for my! Great sound quality.
"Hands free,,.Love itUse it to play music"
Speakers Crackle.This came defective. The speakers are very crackly when playing sound. I am not sure if that is just the sound of the Show 8 or if mine arrived broken.
"Love this for music!This was an early Christmas gift for my husband and he loves it, easy set up."
"I'm not a paid spokesperson.To keep in touch shopping list, timers, information,I can see it becoming more an more."
Good.Like it so far.
Not capable of 3 way chats.We bought 3 so we can talk to our daughter and son at the same time. It does not do 3-way. Highly disappointed
Great when it works correctly.My show 5 in the same location never had any buffering issues. My new show 8  buffers constantly .
Good.Ok
Very useful.I like everything. And I use it for everything
Great buy!Love it!
Good Echo product.Love it
Cool new gadget.So far it’s pretty cool. I wish it had better graphics for quiz games and had radar and better descriptions of the weather
Love the size.Screen size is perfect. Crystal clear picture.
Money well spent.All features work well even when tethering to mobile data.......enjoying the responses I get and how fast this little beast of a box is
Product works great.Solid product with no issues.
Great divece for your family perfect if you're alone.Love it 5stars perfect picture quality great sound perfect size.
Not sure yet.Love it
Make sure you have excellent WiFi!!!Love it
"Smart device that helps you with almost anything.Very good product!! Very recommended if you’re  wanting a speaker, cloak, etc it has anything you can think of...currently making payments and looking forward to pay them off!!"
confused.I like it but sometimes it doesn't do what you ask.
echo show 8 is great.nothing bad I can say love it
"Limited selection.Very limited in video apps,no Netflix,no vudu.Too many hoops and barrels to get these"
We are having fun after a brief learning curve.I like the morning news which gets right to the point.
How much info you can obtain from Alexa.Easy set up and a lot of U.N. with info and questions.
Love it !!i LOVE MT ECCO 8 !!  There are SOOOOOO many commands and things it can do. I'll never be able to remember everything !!! Fun Learning!
Works good and sounds decent.Works good and sounds decent
Works great! Looks great!Love it and it ties into Dots in other rooms as well as the echo input with the outdoor speaker.
"Search for info.very nice monitor and communications. 8"" screen is appropriate."
Awesome!Great echo device! Speaker is loud if you want it to be! Wish I had bought two!
Average Device Horrible Echo.Horrible Echo (irony?) when making any drop in calls. Tried all manners of troubleshooting. It is so bad to be unusable!
Showtime.Excellent sound and video quality!!!!
Excellent.Good product
"Love it!!Love the Echo Show 8!! Easy to use, great sound quality and great picture. Camera isnt so grwat. But I didnt buy it for the camera so no big deal."
"Gift of the year.Excellent device,  great sound and easy to operate , I love it because is bilingual,  can understand both languages and give you what you ask for , English or Spanish,  great tool must have"
"In love with my Echo Show 8.I love this Echo Show, the size is perfect, clear graphics, superb sound and I love the feature of showing the lyrics of the music playing. I had an echo dot and this is an awesome upgrade."
A great buy.The sound is way better than the mini. A fantastic photo album if you store your pictures in Amazon Photos.
Works well.Nice!
wash't able to use calling feature without having a smart phone.Good for answering questions; but couldn't use it to phone or receive phone calls....that part was a bit disappointing.
Its awesome.Me anf my wife just love it he purchased the smat plugs to use with it .
Awesome.We love the echo show 8. Used it on Christmas Eve with kids in Michigan.
Better the Alexa. 😆 User friendly.Live it. I can cook while it reads out the instructions and ingredients.
Love it.I use this product for so many reasons to make things easier for me.  There is nothing I dislike about it.
Amazon does it again!!It captures everything I needed from an Alexa device. Graft price and great value.
"NICE MACHINE.Very nice ,it was a great Christmas gift I received"
Works!Perfect bedside addition!
Great upgrade.The speaker volume and bass was a great surprise. Really happy overall.
"Doesn't work with the Arlo app!Alexa app will link to Arlo, true.. but you get waiting for cameras and it never loads to the show screen.  By reading other reviews this is a common problem."
Love it.I really like this system. I do like the prompts on the bottom of the screen. I have learned some new information. Maybe it could be an option to turn it off for those who do not like it.
Great product.I like the size of the screen and the sound quality is pretty good. Love that they added a slider to camera for privacy. Night mode works great.
Needs better way to search for content.I wish it had a actual browser was given it as a gift and people said perfect for recipes yes if what you want is a generic version of it bad if you want something specific like bon appetit insert meal.
Met expectations.I heard about it on KLove radio and then researched it and thought I might enjoy it while in The kitchen cooking. It’s actually being used by my husband in his home office!
For video chatting the sound is awful.I dislike that when I’m video calling my family in and out of town half the time we have to read lips. There is no sound. It goes on and out. 😢I’m very disappointed.
Great Design and Quality.Comes in handy in our kitchen.  You can get just about any info. you need from her.  Prime video and music are a must with Show 8.
I would recommend.Definitely more reasonable than the echo show 2 and a nice alternative
Alexa is fantastic.Still in the process of learning Alexa. I love all of the features. Really enjoying my Alexa.
Compact size compared to 2nd generation.Better sound quality Thant the 5
So far so good.Haven’t had it long but so far we really enjoy it.
"Love the sound.I love it ! The sound is awesome crisp sounding , loud love that ! I can watch movis whole i work out or listen to music or listen to a book its awesome so ☺"
LOVE THIS!!!We also just got the ring doorbell and they work great together!  The Echo Show is so easy and user friendly and we love having it in our home.
Great product.I love it!! Easy to setup and use. Especially like being able to watch TV and prime video in kitchen. Like trying new recipes provided by echo.
I love all Amazon Alexa products.I love all Amazon Alexa products
"Great product!Exceeded my expectations.  Gorgeous sound and picture. Very responsive, clear and easy to set up. Our family really enjoys this in the kitchen.  Great product."
Reminds me of Siri with a lot of wrong information.Simple questions Alexa doesn’t have an answer. Ex: We asked what year a song came out and she wanted to show us a recipe and we asked our Google assistant and received the proper answer.
"Pretty Happy.I am pretty happy with this product, the sound quality is great and the base in more that what i expected. i am still unsure about how effective the voice recognition is but i really enjoy the product."
I can even video call from one device to the other.This product is great I love it.The speakers are so loud and I love that it can do a lot even start up my car while I get ready for work.
Love it.The sound is freaking amazing.  The connectivity is perfect.  Especially with the Alexa app.
"Great Device.Great device easy setup limitless skills , still figuring out everything it does. Incredible"
Best yet.My favorite of the current echo lineup. Great sounding and it fits perfectly in the kitchen.
In love with Echo.Got this device for Christmas and we absolutely love it. Love the “Good morning” feature in the mornings. The video quality is great and the sound is better then expected.
Love it.Bought it for my mother and she loves it
"Wow, High end sound.Love the screen and the deep rich sound."
Easy to use.👌
"Great product, as advertised.Alexa does much more than expected. Very pleased."
Me gusto mucho.Muy buen producto lo recomiendo se oye muy bien la música muy clarito
GreT size!Love the larger screen!
Nice and loud!Great screen and color!
Why Alexa ? Think before you buy.Unable to video call using whatsappUnable to understand songs of other langaugesSometimes it keeps on repeating same stuff.Not satisfied.Too much of buzz sound..
"Echo show 8.Can't share device with more than 1 person due amazon rules, not good"
So happy.Best sound! Comparable to Bose.
"Drop in feature.Using drop in feature on my phone, can do video calls from store easily... wife loves it!!!"
Love and easy to use!Love it!
Stand should have came with it.I really do like the new  Echo show  Only thing is I wish the stand came with it set up by a good separate spend enough money on it at least they could do is send you the stand for free inside the Box
Great Amazon home gadget!Great and easy to use! Love the big speaker and ability to connect to smart devices. Drop in and announcement features are great
Perfect mix of features.Love my music radio stations. Shows the words to the songs. It does all I need.
Great gift.I bought this for my daughter and she liked it so much I bought myself one also
Awesome product.I love it and the sound quality is great. 👍👍👍
Get one!Exceeded expectations.
Love size.Love this.  Have in my kitchen
Perfect gift for our family members to stay connected.Perfect gift for our family members to stay connected. My 4 year old grandson can call and see my 90 year old father and it feels like we are in the same room.  Picture and sound clarity are amazing.
"Great, minus the clock display.Love me some Alexa.  Very good integration with existing units. Don’t love the fact that the clock does not show full screen like the previous edition did."
Awesome product!I loved the easy synchronization of the of my new addition to my alexa enabled products. The usefulness of this product comes in handy for day to day life.
It rocks.Love it
Arlo camera support needs to resolve video issue.Does not connect to Arlo Pro cameras video as advertised. Spoke to Arlo support they said they are aware and working on problem. Disappointed this feature is not working as advertised.
Would purchase again.I find new uses for this every day! Especially good for finding recipes and playing my favorite music.
A Great Speaker with a Sharp Screen.Much better and more integrated than the Google Nest Hub.
Great product.Does a multitude of things easy to navigate great product
Works Great.Easy set up. Works as advertised .Sounds pretty good for it's size.
Love Alexa —- and the 8 is a whole new level of wow.Picture is beautiful.
"It works.Still breaking it in.  Bought to video call, but have yet to gift the other unit (we bought 2) to our family member to try the device out for video calls."
Life changing.Not sure how I lived without this gadget before!!! The show is now my central command center for all the Alexa and ring devices and if I can set it all up anyone can!!!
Size and clarity.I got for my bedroom to make it easier to read the time.
It’s very user friendly.I haven’t found anything to dislike about it at this time. My husband spends most of the time listening to music.
Great device. Easy to use.Great gadget. Definitely a most if you want to complete your smartphone set up. Good integration wit ring cameras
"Show 8 nice.I simply luv it , and the big screen on the 8 is a plus."
Great device.Love it. Got it mostly to video chat with the grandkids. Fabulous!
"Great product, take some time to Mess with it and see all the cool things can do.Feel like The show has more potential, that you could do more stuff with it that you really can’t. It’s been a week so still have to get the hang of it. Have 3 EchoDot at my house and now the show."
"Great product! Simple to Ise!This is my favorite item in my house. I love how simple it is to use even my 4 year old van use it. Great quality. Love that I can watch movies, find any recipes and there is endless music options."
Love our Echo Show.Love it!  The drop in feature lets us check in our our house when we aren't home and we've integrated it with our other compatible devices.
get one.the whole family loved Alexa
Solid sound and product.Great sound and screen size is good.
Good but has limitations.Works well visual screen is awesome. Only issue facing is it does not control the FireTv and it’s apps on our FireTv smartTv.
Defective product.Echo show became defective after 2 weeks of usage. Unable to reset and couldn’t connect to multiple WiFi sources. Continued to reset to a blank screen with the time and a yellow bar on the bottom.
Love it.So glad I bought it
Working with cable box limitations.The biggest problem I have had is trying to get the tv to be controlled by show. so far I cannot get show to control the cable box and I have to use two remotes.  ???
I guess is just a toy.I don't know if the product is worth the money then the little echo doesthe same thing but has no picture Much cheaper
"Love this!I love my Echo Show 8! I use it to play music, look up recipes, and even to turn my Christmas tree lights off and on! Thanks"
I love it.No dislikes
Sharing with the family!Bought them to share with the parents and kids. We’re really enjoying them.
Great product.Great product I am pleased with everything this unit offers. Makes my Google mini seem like trash.
Great things come in small packages.Great for our kitchen so we can monitor cameras while in the back corner of our house. Sound is of high quality and came in handy at Christmas with background music.
ease to install.it's great
The clearence.Love the audio and picture quality
She's dumb.Any basic question I would ask Alexa came back incorrect or she would state she doesn't know. These were  not complex questions.  The knowledge and search function of Google is 100 times better.
Disappointing.This device has been nothing but a 🤕 it doesn’t seem to like Apple Music.
Drivers throwing packages.I just watched your driver toss my package on my front porch. It is an echo show 8 not a tshirt. I hope my device works. Your drivers should be more careful!! I'm not happy at all
Supercalifragilistic.Awesome product.  Much better then earlier versions.  Great for streaming music and using timers when cooking!
Great Product.The best Alexa product yet. I wished I had purchased it sooner.
Great sound.I just love my new echo show 8! Everything I expected and more! I totally recommend this product!
Unhappy.I was suppose to get the echo 3rd generation free with this . I never got this Item. I ordered this as a promo that was on the your app.
Works great.This was a gift for my father in law and every time I’m with him he’s always playing with it. Great unit and now he’s working on connecting other compatible devices
Awesome.Love this
Pretty neat.It's a little stubborn but I'm Austin getting to know this device.  Still pretty cool
Nice upgrade.Easier to hook up.  The units recognized the network as soon as they were powered up.  The screen is a nice upgrade from the  original echo products.
"Great to have at home!I love the echo show 8! There are so many features I can access! I can talk to it from listening to the music, weather, set up alarm, and much more! I am very satisfied customer!"
Excellent.Exceeded my expectations
"Love how she is constantly telling us how to use her and make our lives easier!Alexa is super helpful! She is great at reminders and playing music! Love how she starts my day with telling me the weather, news, traffic to my locations! Kids love the games she has as well!"
Not as good as the “regular” Echo’s.Doesn’t work well with my Lutron lighting system or Ring cameras. Won’t recognize some of my devices. The speakers have also stopped working and we’ve needed to reset the device
Realizing the echo eight has!This echo was purchased for being able to communicate with my grandson on the other side of the country. I am excited about the other “skills“ I am Realizing the echo eight has!
So Easy.If you have none of the Echo products you need only this one. So easy to use and if you do have any Echo products it's easy you connect them together.
"What’s This.Got this for a Christmas gift, learning how to use it, we like it so far"
Nice size.Easy setup and doesn't take up too much desk space.
Always seems to be attentive.Still trying to learn all about the Show.
How to use it.I have not idea what to do with it got as gift no instruction
Easy to set up.So far so good.
Perfect.The screen size perfect
"Love Show 8.Love my show 8, pair it with echo dots and enjoy Amazon Music."
"Product arrived opened, somebody had previously used.Product had clearly been owned by someone before me, despite me buying it brand new. The sticker on the top of the box had been cut, and it arrived with the box already opened."
Alexa listens with no attitude.I get to have dinner with my grand daughter 500 miles away what a treat. And.... someone (a woman) who will listen to what I have to say and do it.
"The tag ""Try"" suggestion on bottom of screen cannot be removed.I am returning the Echo Show that I purchased on Black Friday due solely to the fact that the annoying feature of ""Try (useless skill)"" cannot be turned off on the home screen."
The best.I like It's amazing I use for everything
Speaker quality is amazing!Sometimes doesn’t catch your wake up word command the first time so you have to speak slower and little louder but the speakers on this are awesome! We love listening to music on the show 8!
Debi’s Review.I already have the echo spot so the echo show let’s me do several other options like make video calls and watch videos.
"That alexa is a very good device to listen to news and get the daily weather reports and more .what I dislike is that voice recognition sometimes because it will look up things that don't have to do with my inquiry but besides that, I think this Alexa device is amazing."
Valuable addition to the kitchen or any room!Great for pulling up recipes and ideas for meals!
"My family and I are now in contact more.After moving away from my family, I was constantly homesick. Now we get together often just to share smiles and laughs."
Like my personal assistant.Is easy to use. Had a little difficulty setting it up but that was due to my lack of technology understanding. Still figuring everything out but like it so far.
Awesome show 8.Great for listening or singing along words show on screen and awesome for recipes
Eric echo show 8.I'm having problem if the language.  I really need it in Portuguese but is doesn't show me this option. I called the support and they are checking.  If you can help me I'll appreciate.  Thx
"My assistant with pictures.Love that it scrolls news and info, weather and new skills for Alexa.  Artwork is available on screen. Great sound too"
Super fun!Love recipes from Alexa. Love knowing what’s on my calendar each day!
Great screen size.Great product with great features though nothing new in comparison with the 5”. Just a more comfortable experience and better sound
Excellent product!Love this product. I have the Show 8 in the kitchen and a Show 5 in the bedroom.  Both are fantastic. Smart home capability and functionality is awesome. Love!
"echo 8.was not what I expected, I can not video chat with others unless they have a echo also.this is not explained in the description.  not very pleased."
Everyone needs one.Love my echo
My new favorite device.I love this so much that I bought one for my parents and one for my best friend!
"Amazing!I totally love this thing! It's amazing what it can do! When you ask for something, 98% of the time it delivers, by finding the information you're looking for."
"Your emails about things it can do have been most helpful.I'm just getting acquainted with the many things I can ask, but find it such fun to explore."
Awesome product.  I love that I can watch movies and music videos.Home
"Trying to watch live tv is in dire need of improvement.It is very cumbersome when using skills. We are trying to watch tv and it is very inconsistent, confusing and limited"
How to integrate two Echo's or change using a new one?Instructions for integration to my home Alexa is not available in the brochure.  How do I do it.I would like to add this echo 8 as a second TV screen.  how do I do it?
Easy set up.Received this as an early Christmas gift and love it.  It was easy to set up which is important to me as my grandkids are not always around to set up the electronics for me!
Awesome.Love
What’s up Alexa.I don’t need to know everything every minute of the day.  I maybe ask it no more than five queries a day if that.  It is cool taking to my brother who doesn’t have FaceTime.
Alexa pinpoints my requests to a T!I'm really enjoying my Echo Show.  The only thing is when it loses WiFi.  Sometimes it doesn't jump back on automatically.  Maybe it's the fault of my WiFi.  I'm not sure...
"My Echo Show.I love this so much better than my dot.I love seeing the time, temperature, and short news clips.It's the greatest!!!!"
Security.Information
Echo Show 8.Works great
perfect.I love it .
Alexa do the dishes!Highly recommended!
Perfect size.I love the bigger screen and it’s the perfect size compared to the echo show 5.
Show me the way.The Echo Show has been easy to set up and learn. Great in the kitchen as well!!
Easy to use.Works great
I love it.Yes
Very good sound and picture.Im very happy thanks amazon
Has room for imporvement.The speaker quality is decent at best. They need to work on better displays for the clock.
Búsqueda más haya de Amazon.Trabaja muy bien sobre todo el reconocimiento de voz lo que me gustaría que la búsqueda de lo que se lePide fuera más haya que solo Amazon como en la música o videos
"Meets expectations but wish there was something a bit more.Quality is great.  Sound is good.  With a video device of this quality I wish there were more video applications to allow viewing of tv streaming (news, live tv apps,etc)."
Easy to use.Love it didn't know if we would like one of these smart things but it so easy to use totally worth it.
"Set up.Took me a while to get my three units connected,but once I did ,I am very happy with the results.I have an Echo ,an Echo Dot, and an Echo View"
Echo show 8.I love Alexa and its functionality.
Alexa 20/20.I really like it. Adds viewing to the Alexa experience.
Great Alexa!I have this in my kitchen. I pull up new recipes all the time. The sound quality is great for listening to music too. I love it!
Amazon did not help!It well not call.
Of all of them the right size to do multiple things.I wish it had a hub in this foot print. It is just the right size. I think it is a very good product.
"Perfect!Works great! No problems with it. Love to skype, watch Amazon Prime, etc. Seems to be a good product."
Works well.Sofar so good. Works with echo wall clock. Good audio and video. Size is fine for use in kitchen wouldnt want anything smaller.
no ads.only thing I don't like are th ed adds o. all the time
Awesome.All good
Mapless.No maps!
Great product.We use it to communicate with relatives in another country and works great!!
Love it.I can close the camera. I can also keep an eye on the kids room.
"A must have for Smart Home devices.Super easy to set up and tie into home smart devices, love it!!!"
Alexa.Very happy with its pro form ace.
Easy to use and understand.We use this to vidio talk with our grandchildren. It works great
"Easy to use.Have only had this a short time so far, but we love it! It was easy to set up and use. It is wonderful to be able to have music in the house by just yelling out what you want to hear."
excelente item.love it
View.Visual capacity
Great piece of tech.Didn't think I'd like it that much more than my Alexa Dot but it's awesome!
Love this!Great upgrade from the original echo show.
Nicely laid out and easy to set up.Doesn't hear as well as the full show did.
Great quality and easy to use.I love the picture and sound quality of this echo! I am using this for FaceTime with my in laws. I’m just kinda sad I don’t have enough compatible items in my house to use with this.
poor video calls.Got it so my wife could video call her sister out of state.Quality of calls very poor.
"Diferencia entre el Echo Show 8 y el Google Home.Yo tengo el Echo Show 8 y el Google Home, y este ultimo tiene mucho mas información y prestaciones que el Echo Show 8, la única ventaja del Echo Show 8 es la pantalla."
Very nice.Works as advertised.  I now have4 echoes.
"So far it works flawlessly.Would like a way to remove the ""Alexa, try this"" line at bottom of screen but otherwise very nice."
Perfectly timed buy.This is honestly better than expected.  Even sound quality is definitely a plus.  Bought during deal days for a great price.
Ok.Ok not as s I expected
Awesome.Great
"Missing Facebook Messenger App.Other than missing Messenger the Echo Show 8 is a great device.I haven't used it to it's full capabilities yet, but it's worked great for what I've tried."
Amazing.Great
"It has made my life alot easier!I love it, she is so helpful reminding me of errands and things i need to do, just learning and exploring all the fun things she can do😁"
"Well worth the money!!! 🤗🤗.Love It !!! Video calling, music, recipes, connected to ring doorbell and living room lights. Just ask Alexa what you want."
Higher Recommended.Enable my SONY BRAVIA XBR MASTER OLED TV
Ease of set uo.For the short time i have had it i like it so far.
Echo Show.Very nice easy to see display.
The convenience and quality of Classic Rock anytime we want 🎶.I love to play classic rock anytime we want and the sound is awesome!  I’m very happy with Alexa upstairs and downstairs 🎶. Thanks for all your help and efficiency!
What an improvement!What an improvement!  Finally a product that I can recommend!  Good job!
Great so far.It’s cool to see things from Alexa. Still learning all that can be done.
"I love this product.Very easy installation, good highlights, very informative, too much fun."
"Great device we love it.Love it, great to share live video with family and also all the great things Alexa has to offer."
It’s helpful if a family member has on to.I have been happy with my new echo.  I can get recipes and play my music and watch my pictures on it.  So much more to do.
Love it.Wife uses it in the kitchen and loves it. She had a echo spot in there and just loves the bigger screen and sound quality.
"Echo Show 8 Rocks.It has a great sound best I have heard, I use it for music ,grocery list and cooking. This was a gift to me this Christmas"
Great speaker on this addition ❤️.Great speaker.  Love
"Helpful.I just had surgery and I love how she’s reminds me to take my medication, instead of writing it down. I’ll haven’t set everything up yet but works great by just turning on. Thanks"
Convenient and friendly.Entertainment and information
Great product and awesome hd quality.Inexpensive and great product
Perfect!I love all my Alexa devices!!
Nice display.The display is amazing at the price point. Easy to setup. Our 5th echo.
Easy setup.Love the echo show!  Setup was easy and it has clear picture.  Orbs good with my ring doorbell.
Wished I waited for something better.Slow to respond compared to my older device. I also think the stand should be included.  Hard to do a phone call without.
Great improvement.I love everything about the echo show.
Great home accessory.I just wish Alexis had the knowledge base of Google or Siri
If you don’t own one you’re missing out.I like the big monitor on it and it’s awesome to have and follows your voice commands iam in the process of ordering 2 more for family members for a Christmas gift
Highly recommend.Easy to use and great sound.
Nothing really it looks and responds nice.I really like the HD screen that it has.

Directv app.I don't like that I can't watch Directv thru this and I can't control my DirecTV's boxes thru this..It should have the skill of DirecTV like the directv app from Google.
Fast and easy home automation.Fast and inexpensive way to automate lights and switches through a home with easy setup! I like displaying our vacation photos on our show 5 and have used it to view recipies!
Very nice.Same as the dot but a tad better...
Great Device.Not being able to take the try this off the home screen.
Great quality.A heck of a buy.
Perfect size.Perfect size to be the household hub. I keep this Echo in the kitchen. Screen is large enough I can clearly see when reading a recipe or someone is at the door.
Great price.Great price point for how big it is
Alexa skills can be complicated.Some Alexa skills are difficult to implement.
Great product.Just wish the video quality was a bit sharper
I love it and I definitely do think it's worth it.Doesn't work as good with the fan on. but other than that I love it

Buyer beesre.Product is not as advertised Slexa skills are difficult to find and do not interact effectively with many of the apps
"How to use it properly.I love the product and I use it to drop it on family, I'm still learning to use it being old I'm not that tech smart."
"It's best to have all devices you want to sync it with handy when you set it up initially.Good device, does most everything we thought it would do. Definitely need an external speaker for dest sound quality while playing music but it does fine with video playback."
Echo show 8 is great.Love the large display. Easily understands my requests.

"Love Alexa!We use this for all sorts of things such as looking up recipes, asking the weather, listening to music, finding out the news and so much more."

Great product for the price.Love the camera lens closer.  Dislike active listening always.
Love.Works great. Speaker and screen are very clear. Easy to hook up to all of our smart house products.
Upset.It’s ok but I was upset as I thought the ring doorbell camera would automatically appear on the echo hub when someone arrives in front of camera but it does not do that.
Stay in touch with love ones.We are able to see and talk with our families living in other cities or another state.
The Sound.There is nothing to dislike .

Vale la pena.Excelente
Great product.My daughter in law loves it.
compact size.conecte to video doorbell to monitor .
Size.Perfect size does everything I wanted.
Embarrassed.The seal was already open when I got the product. I would not have expected this from Amazon US. I'm regular buyer from Amazon. Services in India is far better than US
Camera angle with video call.When making a video call the angle of the camera is tilted up. So need to stand up and close to it. Unless you prop device in the back to make it level.
Good Deal.Works as expected. Love it.
"great info just about everthing.songs general info,recipes,"
This product does have the option to close the camera.I like everything about this product.
Awesome sound.Excellent upgrade
Excellent.Very easy to use and very cool the wife is so happy !!! :) I wasn’t expecting how good the sound of the speaker is 👍🏼👌🏼
Smart home blossoming.Amazed by the volume. Much louder than I thought. Love having the ability to request videos. Also like the check in option.
"Kitchen Helper.So far we live our Echo, it keeps us company in the kitchen"
I can see it without readers!Everything I thought it would be.  Surprised by the sound quality no need for Bluetooth speaker.
Amazing buy.It does so much. Definitely worth it.
Love It.This is the best Alexa so far
Alexa Show is great addition to our kitchen/great room.We've used Alexa Show for all kinds of things and are learning lots about it.  It was a Christmas gift that has been great!

Great gift!Christmas gift for my daughter and she loves it
Best gift to give.Love it
Fun.So far it works flawlessly

The sound and picture.The Echo 8 inch screen is Phenomenal. The sound is better than a sound system. The picture is high quality and I would highly recommend this product.
Echo show eight.One of the best devices That I have purchased
Q.Love the product. No Issues as of now. Please just make sure to put products on porch and not outside when it’s raining. Thankfully the product didn’t get damaged.
Doesn’t recognize/respond to voice.Sometimes she doesn’t respond to my voice when I call her - I have to (at times) use a specific tone for her to respond.
Love our Echo Show 8!We are really enjoying our Echo Show 8. Still learning and exploring its features. Happy we decided to go with the 8 instead of the 5.
"Awesome !!!!!!! Product.I love this product, it's the bomb it even has bluetooth"
"No turn off option for ""thing to try"", feels like paying for ads.The ""try me"" text on top of the home screen is just absurd, how on earth there is not an option to turn that off. Switching to google."
Not what I thought it was.The echo 8 is definitely what I thought it was.  Didn't do enough research before purchasing.
Great value for sound and image quality.Excellent quality sound and great image quality to boot!
"Great product.Great product, works well with the Ring App, unlike other reviews, I have not had any connectivity issues."
"It was a great gift!I love my echo, best gift ever. The video is awesome and it's great to have in the kitchen to check weather anytime or request anything at any time!"
Expected more.Doesn't work with Ring. No video. Works with my Nest and Shark ION.
"Needs bigger clock numbers.Everything worked like it’s supposed to, but it would be nice if the clock numbers were bigger. I’m not disappointed in it, but not super excited about it either."
Very nice echo.Glad i upgraded.great echo show 8
"Totally worth it!My favorite Christmas present by far! I have it in my kitchen and I use it for everything! Music, weather, recipes, news, videos etc."

Good sound quality.I feel like this one still has a few things to work out . The one I have will freeze up or just not respond when I ask it a question.
Love my Echo Show 8.I like my new echo show 8. I use it everyday whether it's listening to music or getting caught up on my shows on prime video or hulu.
Good value.As advertised
Product does not justify the price.It is nothing to brag about.  The only thing I can relate to is the images.  I believe it is over priced.
Not really worth it.it stops playing any kind of sounds at random times and i have to unplug and plug back in at ramdom times
Quality Alexa product.Good product. Exactly what I was expecting.
Works great.Works great.  Love the size for my bedroom!
"Dads new toy.Love this new toy! I’ve hooked up my ring cams, lights, and plugs."

Kitchen use.Its really good for recipes in the kitchen.
Larger screen and text.Love that it shows the words to songs that are playing
Sound.I am very pleased with the echo show. I can’t wait to research and figure out everything that it can do.
Works as expected.Meets my expectations
"Awesome 8.Awesome! I love the 8"" screen nice and big. You can watch your movies on it and it's great for the kids with unexplicit words for songs the like on prime music."
Versatile.Great sound and video
Alexa sometimes mishears me.Sometimes it doesn’t hear me correctly but very rare most of the time it put the correct thing or search’s the correct thing it’s worth the money
Excellent!Absolutely love it! Ordered a couple more for kitchen and another bedroom. Just love them!
Good but not outstanding.It's good.. YouTube could be better and I'm pretty sure they could use the camera for something else too.
Better than echo dot.Love this echo show.
"I had trouble understanding the Oriental lady!I didn't like it first, because it was hard to understand this female, she sounded oriental.  She did not help me and then tired to get me to pay someone $300."
Works great.So far we love it. My daughter loves the amazon music wit lyrics
Great.I love it.
Overall I like it.It’s sad you have to download apps but some apps are unavailable a lot of apps are unavailable this thing is limited

"Bright, Clear display, Great Sound.We're still getting used to having it, &amp; haven't  explored its possibilities very thoroughly yet.  We do look forward to delving into it."
I think mine is mentally unstable.Alexa gets my requests WAY off... even simple ones and I did the voice training and everything.

Poor voice recognition/ great sound.Sound is great but the voice recognition is poor compared to the echo dots.
Same as the others.  “Try...” advertising is awful.Get rid of the Try message. I’m probably going to return this product soon.

Good service.Good service

"I find the ""SHOW"" products to be sub standard.First off, the clock display is soooo small for an 8"" device. Why no full screen? Who designs these things? Then you have the constant onscreen rotation of time-weather-Alexa suggestions-time-weather-suggeations-time. Why even do his Amazon? Allow users the option to select ""full screen clock display"" only. But the real issue is with the overall quality. The sound on these new 8"" units is poor and not clear crisp audio. Sounds like a cheap bluetooth speaker. And the display itself is sub standard and unacceptable. I noticed in a dark room with no background set other than displaying of the clock, there was light bleeding across the screen. Instead of a black screen with the white clock display, you see the entire screen displaying a ""glow"" across the entire screen. Like a TV where the TV is on but no inout is selected, so the screen has a ""faint white glow"" across the screen. I just could not tolerate the poor screen quality, the inability to have a full-screen clock display, and this weird and annoying ""rotation"" feature thing that Amazon insists on designing into their ""Show"" products. And I was very unhappy with the sound quality and the lacking of clarity. Sorry Amazon, but add more user control features into the 'SHOW"" products, and better overall display/sound quality even if you need to raise the price."
"Not as good as the echos show 5.Great concept but missed the mark, I purchased the echo show 5 and It's a great little smart device the only real complaint I had was I wished it was a little bigger, fortunately they had a sell on the show 8 and I thought that would be perfect but to my the surprise the ui was different which is misleading because many user like me thought it was a show 5 just bigger boy was I wrong the clock customization isn't the same and on mine the voice recognition is superior on the show 5 hopefully theres an update before I return it"
"Doesn't support Netflix, very limited apps.Great for seeing the Prime videos you've purchased and can no longer see on your DVD player for whatever stupid reason Amazon and Sony have for no longer supporting each other. However, what would make this alternative perfect, is if it supported Netflix also. But it doesn't. Because heaven forbid you actually have both services on one device.(After I left this review, Amazon Customer Service contacted me and said if you want Apple TV, Netflix and Amazon Prime on one device, you need to get a FIRESTICK or FIRECUBE. Wish I had known that sooner.)Also, this can only run if it's plugged in. When I tried to unplug it to take it to a different room, it died. So, that's a real PITA. It's not as portable as they make it seem. And I don't like the idea of a cord dangling over my sink, so I can follow recipes.If you're going to buy this, get the bundle (the stand is awesome, and you essentially get the plug free) on Black Friday. That's when things cost what they should have always cost to start with.THESE ARE THE ONLY APPS IT PROVIDES: Amazon Prime Video, Tubi, Food Network Kitchen, Hulu, NBC. And so far, the NBC/Spectrum choice doesn't work. So all the apps you see in the description? NOT ACTUALLY AVAILABLE.Also, Alexa doesn't understand simple commands like ""open my video library,"" which is annoying, and for hours, it said that Amazon Music isn't available, but all of a sudden, it became available about six hours later. Not sure what that was about.Really needs update re: software apps, and an updated Alexa interface. I can live with the plug, but this Alexa interface isn't even programmed with the words used on the device.  Screen and sound are good, so that's a plus, but come on. Alexa should be programmed with the words used on the device, like ""access my video library"" or ""open Prime and access my video library.""Hopefully, the Alexa interface will become smarter with use. I went and ordered the fire stick as well, since my DVD player no longer supports Amazon Prime.What would be nice is a longer cord. The cord is only about 4 feet long, so it's too prone to having an accident by someone tripping over the cord."
"Can't do it again due to ""Try"" suggestions and unwanted Ads.I think my Echo Show might be one model older than this.  I'd really like to have more for certain purposes but I cannot get past the annoying messages at the bottom of the screen and the unwanted ads, neither of which can be turned off.  I originally got it because I wanted it for a slideshow of a family wedding.  I found out if there are several people in your house and you have the camera ON it will show a continuous slide show of the photos you've chosen AND you'll get an Alexa ""Try"" message at the bottom of the screen for every one.  Also unwanted ads will pop up about suggested recipes, cars for sale in the area, etc.  I originally thought the slide show feature didn't work because I used settings to turn the camera OFF, for privacy concerns.  Well, if I do that then the slide show stops because I guess the camera needs to sense people or movement in the room in order to show continuous photos and annoying adds.  I'd like another one but I can't do it until this ad problem and camera ON/OFF problem that affects the slide show are somehow fixed with a firmware update or something.  When you have a great family photo displayed on the screen and everyone is looking closer to read ""Try ""Alexa tell me a horse joke"""" that's really annoying.  It has great sound if you use it play music, but that's not the primary reason I purchased this."
"Like it more than I thought I would!Got this on Black Friday (not here but at a big box, was there for something else and the salesman talked us into it.) I was worried about whether or not we would be able to use this to it's potential. While we are still working on all that it does, it's nice to have a central hub (if you will) in our home. We started with this, and had 2 echo dots that we got as well at the same time. Set this all up, and as I set up the others it found them right away. We also got a bulb and it found that right away too. We've since added 2 more dots and more bulbs and a smart plug. Between this and using the app I do like how everything integrates together. My only problem is that sometimes Alexa won't hear her name being called. I think my husband talks too fast for her though haha. Also if the kids are fussing or playing in the background she won't always hear her name then. Just get a little closer to her and it works fine. We also have it set up where we used to set up the tablet for the kids' youtube nursery rhymes to play for background noise. Now we can use the tablet for ourselves again and still have their songs going. The speaker is great, we don't even have it hooked up to our whole-house system and it's been fine. Overall it's a good buy. I don't mind the ""Try"" suggestions at the bottom. I thought I would but I don't even notice anymore. If that's your only complaint about this device, you have far less in life to worry about than most people and if that's your only reason to send it back, so be it but it's not bothering me. I'm too busy feeding and entertaining 2 small kids to be worried about something so trivial."
"Buy a robo vac instead.I received the Show 8 for Christmas and I put it in my bedroom to replace one of the ten dots we have gotten from various deals from Amazon over the last few months.  I am going it 2 stars because I am still trying to figure out how it is $60 better than a Dot.  It basically is a $80 alarm clock and since I am retired I don’t even need an alarm clock!  I do use it to check on my evil Ring devices on my front and garage doors, not much action there but I’m trying to make this $80 useful.  Truthfully I think this thing is a foolish wate of money.  It will soon go into the closet with many of my other electronic purchases trying to make my world better but failing.  The best electronic thing that I have bought so far is an iRobot i7 vacuum, it works, it’s easy, and I love it.  Save your money and get a vacuum, you will thank me in just a few days."
"The Echo Show can change both the life of someone you love and yours, forever.I’m writing this review for the Echo Show 8 because I believe it is the best value but I have several Echo Shows of varying sizes.  About a year ago I gave my 94-year-old mother an Echo Show.  My dad has passed and she now lives alone in Florida. I live alone in Connecticut.  For the most part, I set it so that she and I could ‘drop-in’ on each other.  Doing this has changed both our lives.My mother is not a technology person. She has WiFi internet access through her cable company and owns both a computer and a Netbook. She uses them to play cards, check her email and read.  She does carry a non-smart phone with her when she is out and about but doesn’t use it for regular calls.  Her tech support is me.  For the most part, my tech support has been to say “Mother, go where the cable company’s box is, unplug it, count to 10 and plug it back in”.  I’ve abandoned long ago trying to escalate support to the “Mother, sit down at the computer….“ level.  So far that has been successful for both the Internet and the Echo.  Now, I configured the Echo at home and shipped it to her in a ‘just plug it in” state.  It worked but I only mention this to say it can be done if necessary but I will also say it was not easy – especially for someone like her that has not Internet identity.  I’d suggest you visit your mom to set it up in her home – you don’t visit her enough as it is.One essential tool you will need is an Amazon Fire tablet.  The Fire will be your tech support console and I can’t stress enough how important that is going to be.  You attach it to her Amazon Echo account so you can remotely change settings, add elderly user Skills (there are many) and listen to what she is saying to the Echo - both essential and at times, humorous. Let me add a note on privacy – there is none.  Yet you will still want to set the “Drop-In” command to automatically connect (trust me on this).  It would seem obvious to add this caution but be sure to place the Echo in a public place and wear clothes when nearby.I love my mother but she is Echo challenged. It’s not that she doesn’t use it for other purposes and she has. The only command she really uses is “Drop in on Al”.  Once mastered, she will introduce you to her friends and neighbors.  She will have lunch with you.  She will sit in her chair and talk about your father, your growing up, her growing up.  She will hear you talk about how your day went, your work, your plans for the future. She will silently listen to your rant on politics and seem interested.  Essentially, she will be your mother.This is different from when you visit in person. She won't be worrying about getting new sheets on the bed, trying to think of something to entertain you while you are there.  I tell people that with the Echo you can imagine yourself in her kitchen, talking to her while she is washing dishes.  You will keep the channel open for hours at a time.  This is not Facetime; you can do things. You can cook, make lunch, do the dishes, pay your bill but more importantly – talk. In the morning she will chastise you with “Look who’s getting up so late” in that tone she used when you were 16.  She will ask what you are having for breakfast.  She will be there in the evening to talk about your day.  She once told me that she knows more about me now than at any time before I left for college.  She will tear you up when she says “if your dad had known all of this, he would be so proud of you.”A true judge of the importance of the Echo came when she moved to Virginia to be near my brother.  Before the furniture arrived, before anything, she plugged in the Echo to talk about the move.It is a commitment.  It will be part of her life, and yours, forever.  But it will be a comfort to her and an assurance to you that she is ok."
Perfect gift.I have the echo show 2 gen and bought this for my parents for my dads birthday so we could video call since they don’t have smart phones. They absolutely love it! I helped them set it up and for the small size I was pleased with the volume and quality of the unit. There is a shutter over the camera that ours did not have and my parents really appreciated that addition. My step mom ended up getting one for her grandkids for Christmas because she liked it so much!
"Meh.Was nice, although it relies to heavily on very specific voice commands. Also mine has started emitting a high pitched sounds all the time...."
"Surprise, surprise : ).I'm still discovering the many things that we can do with this product. One being able to immediately see w3ho's at my front door with the Ring doorbell, unlike finding my phone and pulling up the Ring app. By the time I do that most of the time whoever is there is gone."
"Full of disappointment.Subpar product at best. Says devices are discovered then does not list them. Constantly disappoints in so many ways. Doesn't do what is requested, states ""a few items share that name"" when that is not accurate whatsoever. Telling the weather is about the only thing it does correctly."
Doesn’t do daily functions well.I have to keep unplugging and replugging in my TV and lights into my smart plugs for Alexa to recognize them. The show continually tells me it can’t turn them on or off. To say it’s annoying is putting it mildly. It can give me lists all day Long but if won’t do other functions that it’s set up to do then it’s a waste.
Tiny clock display. Huge missed opportunity.Got it for clock in bedroom. Can’t believe you can’t make the clock display bigger. Huge failure.
"Don’t buy.Absolutely useless! Bought explicitly to use in the kitchen and it can’t pull up recipes at all! For example, I’ll say search for recipe with broccoli and I get a variety of recipes, none of which include broccoli! It also does not search the internet for a particular recipe, even if I tell it the recipe name and what website it’s on. Truly don’t understand all the happy 5 star reviews, I guess they like only being able to set timers and make shopping lists that don’t import to your phone for when they need them."
"Does not work as a digital picture frame.Very disappointed with Echo Show 8.  We bought this to replace our existing Echo device because we wanted to have a digital picture frame and I thought that this product could do both functions.  Unfortunately you are not able to disable the sleep timer, which means that the display turns off and the screen goes black after a few minutes.  Also there seems to be no way to disable the display of clock, temperature, and ""Try ..."" .  The product needs to allow the user to have full control over what is displayed."
Perfect!Sound quality is amazing. Love using this in my room since it dims to black when it’s dark and is the perfect alarm clock.
Producto es lindo.Fue un regalo y me ha gustado - estoy comprando uno para una amiga. - lo recomiendo
"Frequent Problems.We've only had it for about 3 weeks. I'm always having to repeat myself with setting timers or playing music. We've had to restart it twice because it couldn't/wouldn't connect to the internet. We've had to restart it because it wasn't making any sound. We checked do not disturb, the volume, and any settings we could think of. So far I'm actually quite disappointed in our purchase."
"Would love to rate this all 5 stars but can't connect to my brother's school network :(.The school has a secured network and can't be discovered via the device. For now, this device is paper weight."
WOULD NOT CONNECT TO WIFI WITH OUT SAVING WIFI PASSWORD TO AMAZON ACCOUNT.It’s a good product but it would not connect to WiFi when I Unselected the option to save my WiFi password to amazons server. Would not recommend if you do not want your password Be on Amazons server.
Anyone over 60 should get help cause it’s to darn hard for us.I’m having the hardest time trying to get my pictures uploaded to Echo Show 8 it took the pictures off my iPad and can’t get them back on the iPad or echo Show. Anyone over 60 should get help cause it’s to darn hard for us.
They are not that easy to work with.I like it just not what I expected
"Very versatile device!So far I absolutely love it! Listening to music while cooking, play lullabies for our puppies who currently sleep in the kitchen, dance parties etc. Looking forward to watching tv, movies and recipes!"
"Find something else to do.Do people just sit and stare at their Alexa Show all day? They must, otherwise the ""Things to try"" prompts wouldn't bother them so badly. Get a life people."
Ads.I love the product and I hate the ads. Please please get rid of the ads. I already bought your product stop trying to sell me more stuff and if you cant then at the very least reduce the price A LOT
"A continuous commercial.If I wanted to watch infomercials all day, I could watch cable tv.  Rolling advertisements for recipes and non-stop suggestions are annoying.  Nothing like unexpected.  This is useless."
"Corporate Greed.Would have been a great product to have but Bezos raised the price a few days before release, so I’ll never buy one."
Kid loves it.Speaker could be better. Should have a lock screen option for small children.  Overall great.
"OK, BUY.Works well, but there was on offer for a smart plug that could not be accessed.  Tried multiple times without success"
You cannot natively run YouTube or YouTube TV.It would be a 5-star unit if it had YouTube and YouTube TV available on it
Show me front door.I love everything bout echo show 8
"Echo show 8 beautiful for cooking and bake with the recipes.I like how I could set the time with alexa when I doing baking,and have different recipes"
Very happy with it.This was a gift from our son.
Exceeds expectation.Very pleased with item.
It's not good.I didnt like the fact that I cant connect any devices.
Great.It’s perfect
Beautiful display and clear voice.I really liked the ease of setting it up for use.
Buy it!It's amaaaaaaaazing!
best.Good quality
Great product.Great music
Nice.Nice
"I think that this is a great product for me as a senior.I love the fact that I purchased and installed switches for lights, fans, stereo and other things in my home.  Having challenges and being able to ask ALEXA to turn them on or off is great.  I have Ring as well as WYZE  cameras all around my property, indoors and out.  As a senior, I sometimes leave lights on in other rooms, in the garage and in my Arizona room..  I can ask ALEXA to show me the room and if a light or stereo equipment is on in that room, I can turn products on or off from my bed or my easy chair.  I have 4 Echo Shows and several echo dots. and several wall plates and switches that operate with ALEXA I love being able to play music everywhere on all of them.What I don't like is that it is, sometimes hard for me to communicate with ALEXA , I guess that she doesn't understand diversity, ebonics, or my southern drawl.  It seem that she doesn't always, wait for me to finish, my request before she is answering and it is usually not the response that I wanted.  Since I have to use ALEXA to wake her up I would like her to be able to call my name in her responses, sometimes she does and other times she doesn't.  I have no idea when or why she does that, what the heck did I say to trigger her calling my name. but I love it when she does.  I started with the echo show 5 and loved it, but at night I had to try to find my eyeglasses to see what was on the screen in my bedroom.  Since then there was a sale on the echo show 8 and I purchased 2, and i don't need to struggle with my eyeglasses to see her.  I'm in love.  The echo show 8 does a lot more that the 5's and have a better sound quality to it.One other thing is that I am a child from the Harry Truman Administration, I had no idea that all of these devices take up a lot of Wi-Fi, I had  to increase my Wi-Fi, or whatever to the tune of an additional $30. a month."
"Visual reinforcement is way helpful as I get old (I'm 70).I waited a while to get to know my Echo Show 8 until I had become more comfortable and familiar with it. Of all the first experiences I've had with Echo Dot and Echo, this one has been the most positive. While it can be a little distracting, I like having information such as weather and time always available. I also like having the visual feedback with I give a command. The image and sound are both excellent and having timers on the screen frankly beats the pants off of my Echo Wall Clock (which I still love). Someone at Amazon has taken many hours to find out what blows our collective skirts up and then stood us all over a subway vent!"
"POOR VOICE COMMAND RECEPTION.I have first generation alexa echo dot first and third  gen. Got Alexa Echo show 8 recently.Very disappointed in the devices ability to hear commands. Even when i am with in 3' of the show, commands are picked up by either of the dots and not by show. Infact latest dot is not effective as my oldest one.I thought it was faulty device. Returned and got new one. No difference. Now i know that cost saving is in effect.I do like the screen and the display.BUT VERY DISAPPOINTED IN ECHO SHOW 8'S ABILITY TO RECEIVE VOICE COMMANDS.DON'T THRIFT THE MOST IMPORTANT FEATURE.THAT'S DUMB AMAZON... VERY DUMB"
"Can't turn off Alexa suggestions that keep changing on the screen.Good picture and sound, responds well to voice commands. The problem is the annoying Try""Alexa, show me et.,etc., changing all the time on the screen. Tech support says they can NOT be turned off. I am returning mine to Best Buy (not their fault, but that's where I bought it)."
"Fun Product.I like the Echo Show with the larger screen. The bigger screen allows for nicer viewing of pictures and information presented by Alexa. The Show provides a great hub for home automation to control lights, stereo, etc.I do wish the Show was more configurable, but most applications seem to be hard-coded to what they do. For example, it would be nice to be able to display how long each picture is shown while showing pictures from Amazon Photo, but this doesn't seem to be available."
"Echo Show 8.Love Love my 2 Echo Show 8’s. I have one in my kitchen and bedroom. I have an echo show 5 in my den. I have 2 echo show 5’s that’s not set up, yet. I gave an echo show 5 for Christmas gift, along with 2 echo dot third gen. I started purchasing my Alexa devices, during the summer, because I knew they would be great Christmas and birthday gifts. I Love the 8 inch screen. It’s not too big nor small. The resolution and sound is amazing. I’ve had great results with the web browser, YouTube, food network, music and video chat drop in. The Echo Show has endless possibilities...Go order yours TODAY...."
Awesome.Wish I could face it to a Google Hub and make them have Furby-esque conversations. But I do wish I could change the voice to a man's. Seems kind of anti-feminist of Amazon to keep the assistant a female. And sexist to boot! I need a non-binary Echo Show!!!!
Very dope.I love my echo  show 8. The beautiful wide screen really gives my living room a very modern sleek look. I own 6 echo devices. They all are the mother board to my smart home.  Very dope. I have a echo show 5 but I enjoy the 8 inch much better. The sound is amazing too. The games are fun. The drop in.  I could go on and on about the specs. Dope af.
"Who needs ""Hey Google"".Replaces a Google Lenovo device with Echo Show 8. Am VERY pleased with the integration with Prime for streaming music etc. As I am hearing impaired poor sound quality sounds shrill and actually uncomfortable. Not so with the Echo! Great sound. Quality product at an affordable price!"
"An upgrade to the original Echo Show at a lower price.Better sound, bigger screen and smaller overall compared to the original Echo Show. I love this device."
No full screen click what gives amazon.I am very disappointed that there is not a full screen clock. Echo show 5 has a full screen clock. Can amazon send out an update with full screen clock options like the show 5. If this device had a full screen clock it would be an a+++++++ buy. Without the clock it's a C- at best. Come on amazon make it right
"Everything runs like the Alexa dot, but with nice 8"" screen.  FIX THE SOFTWARE COMPLAINTS.Did NOT like continuous display of ""try"" rotationsDid not like only ONE CLOCK!SOFTWARE needs to be more user frendly allowing user to choose and adjust featuresAdd a little better graphic equalizer"
Check the price.Great gift and amazing product .Sooooo Max that I bought this and it was listed as a buy early for a lower price of $99To then have it be sold for &amp;$89!Such a rip off. Mad that amazon does this
Gives me a bigger screen for security camera &amp; let's me see if I left the separate garage door open.Haven't had much time to learn all the skills and incorporating it into my life but have enjoyed having the music and being able to change things just by speaking to it. Wish I could change it's name!
"Clear show.Works great nice change to see what is going on, read the music 🎶 while listening , lookup just about anything overall nice changeScreen is clear and sharp and sound quality is good"
"It's okay, but...Not really impressed with it...may interact with some security cameras but won't stay in view for more than a few minutes. Also, sometimes it gets confused with what you're directions are."
Overall a pretty simple set up.  Bravo Amazon!I have this to replace my alarm clock in my master bedroom and to control some other devices in the room including my new Flat Screen with Alexa!  Love it!
Upgraded show.Uograde from the original show. Sound is better and bigger screen. Opted to get a stand that allows me to move up and down and side to side! Perfect!
Toying between the 5 and 8? Get the 8.I bought the 5 and 8 and the 5 was to small and hard to read. The 8 is perfect!  I love the photo slide show. And the screen quality is pretty good too.
Perfect addition.This is a must have for your amazon connected home.  Very good screen and sound quality. We love it. Perfect addition to our alexia devices!!
Excellent Item For Smart Home or standalone media center!Excellent item to add to my smart home. I'm still learning how to add my other hubs and devices so that they work in tandem.
"Great product!What a great device! Alexa setup is so improved, couldn’t be easier. I ditched my alarm clock with the new Echo show8”."
Great update.Great device. My wife really enjoys it and the sound and screen are very impressive for the price!
"Great product!8"" screen is awesome.  Sounds great too.  Screen resolution is better than the Echo show Gen1."
As described. Wish Alexa wasn't confined to gender stereotypes!As described but totally confined to binary gender stereotypical house roles. Such trope.
Great addition to my smart home setup!Is way better than I expected. Sound quality was awesome and very clear.  Occasionally it has a mishap but I’ve noticed the more I use it the better it gets . It even starts to suggest things that might work with it as far as integration of skills and routines. VERY HAPPY WITH THIS PURCHASE.
"My Voice pick up.Wished I didn’t have to mute tv which was low already, it has a hard time hearing and picking up my voice. Also a lot of questions, Alexa was unable to answer my questions. Or even to get to the music that I like. Beautiful display, I wished I can change the clock display which could just be me as I’m still learning"
Works really well.It works well with my Ring so I can visually see whose at my door.
"Nice little tool.Easy to setup, bought it my ring door bell, so other people see who at door, who are not cellphone savvy. Once thing to have when want look something up, or play music"
"This is the one!This one is my favorite.The size is right, the speaker is excellent and I can turn off the camera."
Quality of the video.Wonderful! We are able to see our grandson everyday if we want!! Love the product!
"W soizS.Aeewaa:: ssssss /.:63i?,8,8,$,.( y. At Ted"
Great so far.I have only had this for a good week.  So far so good.
Love Everything About It.I love the picture display on screen. I use to have the tall cylinder Alexa for several years but having the screen and seeing everything is perfect. So glad I got it.
Really like.Would like more internet action
Love it!Pretty amazing product. While I am biased towards the Apple eco-system. I am ready to dump the HomePod. Echo 8 works great... very intuitive as well.
"Camera position.Love just about everything on the Echo Show 8 except, where the camera is located at (upper right hand corner.) If they had it centered like the Echo Show 10, it would've made a big difference. Luckily, I purchased a base for it, to where you can swivel it around so it doesn't bother me much."
Works well.On screen try this is still forever present.
Awesome.It's awesome it does everything and more keep your calendar keep your contact keep your meetings remind you of certain engagements is this great
Works excellent.Very nice
Language setup.Not able to download the desired language English/Hindi. Amazon technical support team says that this language will be available only when echo show 8 is launched in India. This sounds quite illogical to me. Why I can't setup a language of other region in USA.
Woo Hoo.This thing is awesome!!!
Great product.I love Alexa.
I love my Echo Show.I like the fact that you can get music at the drop of a hat plus all the other things Alexa does.
Won’t be disappointed.I love it
Sounds great.Great deal.
Great.Love it
Better than expected.Love sound quality and visual feedback
Five Star...Amazing product.  Truly.
Good.Good
la integracion con varios dispositivos es muy buena.A un le falta la integracion con varias aplicaciones como Netflix. abrir o cerrar los garages con un comado de voz entre otros.
Easy setup.I like the size of the screen : fits perfectly in the kitchen : waiting for more streaming services/ Apps:  easy to set up if you have other Alexa devices connected in the home
Opinion.Optional swivel stand was pricey
"It used to play Apple Music, not anymore.I keep getting ""Sorry, I am having trouble playing music"", not even Amazon music or Apple Music. If it continue doing this I will have to return this device."
I like I can get information when I need it.It’s ok
You can make great video calls.As I have other echoes without video screen I like this one because of that reason to make video calls
Pretty good.A little slow on response
Great product.Great sound quality and great price.  Will be purchasing smart recepticals in the near future.
👍.Great product being able to turn speaker off and camera off gives us peace of mind.
You need to have AC.You need to have AC
It can’t play movies from Netflix.I like and love everything about it it comes in handy are used in my bedroom every day love it
Alexa can’t hear me.Alexa has trouble hearing me
It’s a very good product.My family love it
Be equal to echo device for commands currently it’s dumber than echo 3’s.Bulky
"Easy to use.Easy to set up, we got our granddaughters one for Christmas it’s so much fun when they drop in, love it"
Works like it should.I haven't had any problems with it. Everything works just like it should..
Happy with this.Clarity on the screen is nice to view pictures.
"Good product.I had to fire her once, she could not hear me."

I love it.The best
Great.We are enjoying the device

Amazing sound quality!Music and Cooking
Easy to use.Easy to set up
"Hardware is decent, Software needs work.Updated... Update 2Pros:* The Audio is loud and works well with this device* The Screen is a good size, looks fine and is viewable a couple feet away without issueCons:* The User experience relies heavily on a phone app and voice commands. While there are ways of accessing menus manually, it still feels a bit clunky and I wish there was a way to switch to a quieter tablet style mode.* UI in general is clunky, don't expect a tablet experience at all.* Some voice commands don't work properly, sleep timers in some video apps won't work (major problem if you're data capped)* Doesn't provide useful information when something goes wrong. No error code, just a ""Sorry, something went wrong""** Hulu managed to break again, disabling/re-renabling doesn't fix it. Can only watch ""Keep watching"" content. Not happy about this since Hulu was the only selling point for us.General Thoughts: Hardware wise, this is a great price. Software wise, I hope Alexa get's smarter and they improve the user experience. If you're using an older phone, triple-check that you can use the Alexa App because it may be necessary."
Great device!I had a problem with a AM radio station cutting out anywhere from 5 to 30 minutes after starting. The issue was resolved with some great Customer Service help from radio.com. Everything now works as it should. I can now listen to an AM station without static and poor reception.
Awesome.I love the Echo dot but the show 8 blows it away.
Just learning.It was very helpful
Still learning!Still learning!
Very happy.I loved it
"Awesome.This.thing.is.awesome!!! I currently have it in my master bathroom and I love it.  I watch NBC on Hulu every morning while getting ready, listen to my Apple playlists orrrr if Watch my RHOA while taking a bubble bath sipping a cocktail! Lol! Voice command works well.  I have to speak kinda quietly to it so my show responds and not my echo dot that’s only a few feet away."
